# Danto, Dutton, and Our Preunderstanding of Tribal Art and Artifacts
by Michael Kelly


How can we understand the art and artifacts of tribal societies, given that the ethnocentric label 'tribal' implies that those societies are radically different from our own culturally and conceptually? To begin with, how do we know whether tribal people make an art/artifact distinction? If they do, is it the same as ours? If not, how can we correctly understand what seem to us to be their art and artifacts?

These questions suggest a dilemma. If we disregard the historical differences between our practices of creating cultural objects and those of tribal societies, a universal art/artifact distinction is possible; but at the same time the claim to universality is difficult to defend either because it is not clear how it could ever be substantiated or because it is thought to be a weapon of cultural imperialism. Yet if we highlight historical differences too much, a universal distinction becomes impossible and relativism sets in, locking us in our own world, unable to understand tribal objects. Is there any way out of this dilemma, which has led, according to James Clifford, to "a pervasive postcolonial crisis of ethnographic authority"?"

Arthur C. Danto and Denis Dutton have recently reflected on these issues." While Danto is right that "it is through a system of philosophical thought that we must construct the questionnaires that are to take us into the other culture,"" he is too quick to elevate this "system," and particularly our art/artifact distinction, to universal status. Dutton is judicious in balancing Danto's conceptualism with the perceptual factors needed to discern the differences between tribal objects, but he misguides us by suggesting that our perception is independent of our concepts of art and artifact. After examining Danto's and Dutton's strategies, I argue that we can rely on our art/artifact distinction if we do not insist that it be universal. It is rather to be seen as one of three major components of our preunderstanding of tribal objects, the other two being our 'commodification of tribal objects' and 'aesthetic interest.'

By 'preunderstanding' I mean our historical understanding of our own art and artifacts, which forms the cognitive and affective starting point of our experience of tribal objects and which enables them to become

objects of possible understanding." Although this preunderstanding is constitutive of our understanding of tribal objects as art and artifacts, it alone does not transform them into art and artifacts any more than the label 'tribal' transforms a society into a tribal one. That is, how we come to understand tribal objects is a distinct, though not separate, matter from what makes them what they are. The 'what' is determined by historical factors in addition to our preunderstanding, beginning with the cultural conditions under which the objects are created and including how they are conceived and perceived by the tribal people themselves.

Now, given our preunderstanding of objects, and in light of the above dilemma, how can we acquire a 'correct' understanding of them? A critique of our preunderstanding allows us to do so, and thereby to dissolve this dilemma, though only if we remember that our preunderstanding is a historical condition of, but not equivalent to, our understanding of tribal objects. The criteria of correct understanding are not established by us or the tribal people alone, but in the process of our dialogue with them; such criteria are therefore neither prior to nor independent of this dialogue. My strategy here is thus a middle ground between Danto's formal ideal of universal concepts of art and artifact, and Dutton's ethnographic ideal of cross-cultural perception of tribal objects.

I. DANTO'S POT PEOPLE AND BASKET FOLK

Danto discusses the problem of how to understand tribal objects by devising a thought experiment. He conceives of two cultures, the Pot People and the Basket Folk, who occupy "distant regions of the same vaguely bounded area, but separated by some geographical feature that has enabled them to evolve in different ways."" Each culture makes pots and baskets, but with an important difference. As their names suggest, the Pot People's pots are "thick with significance," while their baskets are merely items of domestic life; and the Basket Folk's baskets are "objects of great meaning and possessed of special powers," while their pots are useful objects with no further importance.© Since the two cultures have never had any contact with one another, each is quite confident of its distinction between their own pots and baskets.
Matters become complicated when examples of the two types of pots and baskets are transported to two museums in a third, Western culture.

TRIBAL ART AND ARTIFACTS 41

The works of art, the Pot People's pots and the Basket Folk's baskets, are exhibited in an art museum; while the artifacts, the Pot People's baskets and the Basket Folk's pots, are displayed in a natural history museum. So far so good. But then two dioramas are set up in the natural history museum to represent the everyday lives of the Pot People and Basket Folk. Each diorama includes examples of pots and baskets in their separate roles as art and artifacts. When some young school children visit the natural history museum, one girl, who is an aspiring philosopher, is puzzled about the Pot People's and Basket Folk's baskets because they look exactly the same, yet some are labeled artifacts and some art.
She asks her teacher, who responds that there is a difference though one that she herself cannot explain. Unwilling to accept that there is a distinction she cannot see, the student persists with her inquiry about how to discern art and artifacts when there are no perceptual differences between them.

After rejecting several ways of making the art/artifact distinction other than on perceptual grounds," Danto introduces his own proposal. He argues that the distinction is a conceptual or philosophical matter to be treated accordingly: the meaning, thought, and content of the Pot People's pots and of the Basket Folk's baskets distinguishes them as art from their look alikes - the Pot People's baskets and the Basket Folk's pots - which have only utility values. The particular meaning will of course vary from one culture to another (we emphasize reason, for example, while tribal peoples are thought to emphasize power), and there will be similar variances with utility. Yet the distinction itself is universal: "My sense is that the philosophical structure of African artworks is the same as the philosophical structure of artworks in any culture,"" and similarly for the structure of the respective artifacts. Thus, according to Danto, what makes a work of art a work of art is the same, in concept, for tribal cultures as it is for Western cultures, and what makes an artifact an artifact is likewise the same for both (and, in fact, for all) cultures.
Hence the need for the young girl in the thought experiment to be an aspiring philosopher: she is finally able to discriminate between the perceptually indiscernible baskets by relying on a universal, conceptual art/artifact distinction.

Part of the attraction of Danto's argument is that his universal art/artifact distinction seem to solve the young student's problem; that is, it is persuasive on pragmatic grounds, albeit with conceptual tools, by showing that the resemblances between the different baskets are

42 MICHAEL KELLY

aesthetic illusions." Yet although some such distinction is useful in solving the problem at hand, it is not for that reason universal. What argument does Danto then provide to justify his claim that the art/artifact distinction is universal? He invokes Hegel at this point, which I think only weakens his case."" Whereas Hegel has a metaphysico-logical system to support his contention that the Western concept of art is universal (since it reflects the highest stage of the world-historical development of art toward its Idea), Danto rejects such a system."" He also discusses here the similarities and differences between the Greek philosophical understanding of art and artifacts and our own; plus he recommends that we can come to understand the art and artifacts of other cultures through the meaning and utility they embody just as Wittgenstein suggests that we can understand other people's minds through the medium of their bodily actions. While these points clarify Danto's ideas, they do not support them.

Since Danto provides no other convincing argument for his claim about the universality of the art/artifact distinction, and since it is not clear to me what other he could give, the claim remains unpersuasive. This means that, on Danto's own terms, he has not yet solved the young student's problem; for he would not be satisfied appealing to an art/artifact distinction that is ours alone. In addition, as Susan Vogel argues in the same catalog in which Danto's essay appeared, a universal distinction would not solve the problem anyway; for there are many tribal objects that are meaningful though not beautiful and many that are useful and beautiful at once." The point of this objection, which Dutton echoes, is that the problem cannot be solved without the help of the aesthetic, perceptual dimension of tribal art and artifacts which Danto systematically excluded."

II. DUTTON®'S JUNGLE PEOPLE AND TOURIST PEOPLE

Dutton raises several of his own objections to Danto's thought experiment." His major objection begins with a question: By whom can the differences between the Pot People's and Basket Folk's baskets (or pots) not be perceived? To answer, Dutton introduces a new thought experiment, drawing on his experiences with art and artifacts from the Sepik River region of New Guinea.

He asks us to imagine two cultures, the Jungle People and the Tourist

TRIBAL ART AND ARTIFACTS 43

People, who in general develop separately but have had some contact, which we know because their languages and mythologies overlap in significant respects. The two peoples produce very similar carvings, but the Jungle carvers make them as part of their ritual practices and cultural traditions. They are highly revered for making intricate, twosided carvings with hard wood which contain spirits of the dead visible in the dark. The Tourist People, as you would guess, are merchants from the same region who make carvings exclusively in order to sell them to tourists. They carve with soft wood and only on one side, and they keep the designs as simple as is required to make the tourists believe they are getting authentic Jungle carvings.

Dutton continues his thought experiment by introducing what he takes to be a Danto-like supposition, namely, that nobody can ever tell the difference between the Jungle People's and Tourist People's carvings.
While logically possible, this is barely conceivable once we step out of the philosopher's study, Dutton argues. First of all, when we make mistakes about the different carvings, we misperceive individual examples, not a whole genre, as Danto seems to assume. So "the irrelevance of perception," which is his conclusion, "cannot be said to follow" from our isolated mistakes."" Secondly, even if at times we cannot distinguish the different carvings, certainly the Jungle and Tourist People are able to differentiate them. Moreover, Dutton adds, we can learn to avoid such mistakes by following their lead: " . . . trained perception, the ability of tribal peoples themselves to see systematic differences between art and artifact - and the ability of the informed Westerners also to learn to perceive differences - is the key.”16 In effect, he thus suggests to the young student in Danto's thought experiment that she emulate the Pot People's and Basket Folk's perceptual acumen in order to distinguish their baskets in the natural history museum: " . . . it is a matter of gaining cultural knowledge in order to see aesthetic qualities which have intentionally been placed in the objects to be seen.""

Although I agree with the spirit of Dutton's objections, since he critically examines the relevance of Danto's thought experiment to our understanding of tribal objects, he also fails to solve the young student's problem. The 'by whom' question at the heart of his major objection, which seems disarmingly to the point, speaks to a different issue. Danto never claims that the Pot People and Basket People cannot recognize the differences between their respective pots and baskets. Rather, his inter-cultural problem is how we in the museum can distinguish them.

44 MICHAEL KELLY

Dutton cannot solve it simply by appealing to how they (the People) make their art/artifact distinction on perceptual grounds and suggesting that we follow their example. This appeal merely shifts the problem from one of how to understand tribal objects from the perspective of our art/artifact concepts to one of how to understand them from the perspective of the Tribal People's perception. To resolve this new problem, he must explain both how they perceive the differences between their objects, and, more importantly, how we can understand their perception, especially given the difficult case of indiscernibles Danto imagines. These explanations, not the acumen of those who make the relevant distinctions, provide the key here.

The difficulty with Dutton's strategy is that we cannot adopt the perceptual perspective of the tribal people without first critiquing our own perspective in conceptual as well as perceptual terms. Such a critique is precisely what Danto opens up by stressing the role of our concepts in the understanding of tribal objects, but then he forecloses it, I think, by claiming that our art/artifact distinction is universal. Dutton, on the other hand, takes one step forward by reintroducing perception into the picture, but then he retreats, in effect, by underestimating Danto's perceptual problems. He does address these problems by discussing forgery, namely, the possibility that the Tourist People could eventually make carvings that are perceptually indistinguishable from the Jungle People's. He tries to solve them by claiming, again, that we could be duped only in individual cases, and that we could minimize the risk of forgery even in those cases by acquiring more knowledge of the Jungle People's cultural meanings and artistic practices." But this strategy cannot work because we cannot learn to discriminate between Jungle and Tourist carvings without relying on how we understand (perceive and conceive) our own art and artifacts, that is, without relying on what I am calling preunderstanding.

III. OUR PREUNDERSTANDING OF TRIBAL OBJECTS

A nineteenth-century prejudice in art history, anthropology, and philosophy was that you could not have art without culture, that tribal people did not have culture, and that therefore they did not have art." By contrast, a modern, twentieth-century prejudice is that, as our own understanding of art was expanded, we began to discover that tribal

TRIBAL ART AND ARTIFACTS 45

people have both culture and art."" Most recently, postmodernists have admonished us to bracket our concepts of tribal art and artifacts in deference to those of the tribal people whose objects we are trying to understand."

These shifts in our view of other cultures seem momentous, until we look more closely. While the elevation of tribal objects to the status of art seems to be part of a world-historical process of decolonization, it actually reproduces one of the main discursive weapons of colonialism.
Earlier, it was the Western definition of culture that excluded tribal people's objects from the pantheon of art, and now it is the Western understanding of art that includes them. In both cases, the West has what Sally Price calls "definitional prerogative," i.e., an advantage in making important distinctions for all the world's cultures." As a result of this advantage, there is an asymmetry in our discussion of tribal objects: we set the standard to judge whether they are to be excluded or included, while insisting that the standard is not ours alone but universal (even if the tribal people are not aware of it).

In the shift to postmodernism, this asymmetry appears to be overcome because the tribal people are now allowed to speak in their own voice, which is clearly a positive step. Unfortunately, the asymmetry is replaced here by unintelligibility rather than symmetry if we are expected to bracket our preunderstanding of tribal art and artifacts. For we cannot possibly have a dialogue with the tribal people if we silence our own voice, if we eliminate one of the conditions that makes tribal objects into objects of possible understanding. On the other hand, we can have a dialogue with tribal people, if, while acknowledging our preunderstanding, we refrain from claiming that any of its components is universal.

There are, I think, at least three major components of our preunderstanding of tribal objects: (A) our commodification of tribal objects; (B) our aesthetic interest; and (C) our art/artifact distinction. In explaining these components, I would like to separate two of Clifford's insightful observations about the 1984 primitivism show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York:" (1) that the MoMA curators' concepts of art and artifact shaped their understanding and exhibition of the 'primitive' objects; and (2) that some of these curators claimed to have discovered a universal art/artifact distinction in the course of their experiences with tribal objects." While the first point concerns what I think is a historically conditioned dialogical process of preunderstanding, experi46 MICHAEL KELLY

ence, and understanding, the second is a philosophically unjustified elevation of our Western concepts.

(A) Most of us in the West experience tribal objects in the context of commercial trading and cultural exchange. Such trade and exchange are material evidence of the fact that we experience them in the way we conceive of our own art and artifacts, namely, as commodities to be bought, sold, and displayed in museums. Although this fact may seem merely negative because it implies an imposition of our cultural practice onto their objects, it also has a positive or enabling side: by establishing a mediating context between tribal cultures and our own, the commodification of non-Western objects makes them into objects of experience and possible understanding.

Once we experience the tribal objects, there is of course a problem about how we can attain a correct understanding of them. This problem arises, however, only after they are in this new context. So it is the dynamics of this context which set our possible understanding in motion and which determine, in part, the criteria of correct understanding. We soon find, for example, that we cannot conceive of them just as commodities for the simple reason that we do not conceive of our own art and artifacts as mere commodities. That is, although tribal objects have to become commodities to be understood by us as art and artifacts, they are not for that reason only commodities. Their objects, like ours (we assume), have complex identities as modes of cultural expression, spirituality, critique, etc. While these identities are certainly altered once the objects become commodities, they are not entirely lost any more so than are the identities of our art and artifacts." There is thus something else about the tribal objects, especially the ones we think of as art, which prevents them from being reduced to commodities. What is that something? The answer to this question requires that we understand more about the historical context in which these objects are created. But before doing that we must examine the other components of our preunderstanding because they shape how we understand that context.

(B) The Kantian notion (and practice) of aesthetic interest (as distinct from moral, practical, scientific, and other interests) has historically been an integral part of our conception of art, helping us to distinguish works of art from mere objects, commodities, and artifacts. But aesthetic interest

TRIBAL ART AND ARTIFACTS 47

has also helped to blur the art/artifact distinction. For it is when we believe that we can willy-nilly take an aesthetic interest in cultural objects regardless of their historical context that we find ourselves confused about the art/artifact distinction; in short, we often find ourselves taking such an interest in artifacts as well as art. This happens especially when our aesthetic interest is combined, as it generally is, with commodity exchange. For example, it is by divorcing tribal objects from their historical context in order to deal with them as commodities that we first being to think of them in terms of aesthetic interest. But when these same tribal objects are perceived in aesthetic terms, they resemble our artifacts and so we become confused (along with the young girl in Danto's natural history museum) about what distinguishes art from artifact after all. Aesthetic resemblances thus blur the very distinction aesthetic interest was intended to clarify.

At the same time, however, our aesthetic interest is an enabling condition of our experience and possible understanding of tribal objects.
Without it, we would not likely interact with them at all, or else we would tend to treat them as mere commodities, artifacts, or, as Danto has noted, art only in the analogical sense that they are thought to reflect earlier stages of our own art history."" So to be regarded by us as what we consider to be art today, tribal objects must be viewed, to begin with at least, in terms of aesthetic interest.""

(C) Finally, our art/artifact distinction also enables our understanding of tribal objects, for we simply cannot understand them without presupposing how we conceive of our art and artifacts. This does not mean, however, that we understand their objects only in terms of this distinction. The reason for this qualification is not only because of the other components of our preunderstanding and the historical context in which the tribal objects are created, but also because of the openendedness of our distinction. That is, we have so much trouble distinguishing tribal objects, as well as understanding how the tribal people distinguish them, because we have so much trouble making our own objects conform to our distinction. Many people agree that most, if not all, works of art are also useful and thus are artifacts as well, though few, if any, artifacts have what else it takes to be works of art." So art has something more than use value, even though it may have that, too.
There is little agreement, however, about what the 'more' is, nor does there need be any. It is enough that people agree that there is some48 MICHAEL KELLY

thing more, granting them the freedom to explain what it is on their own terms.

Now, the freedom we already extend to people in our own culture is just as easily and commonly extended to those in tribal cultures regarding their own objects. But it remains to be seen what they make of this freedom, namely, how they make the art/artifact distinction; and it is even an open issue whether they make the distinction at all. These possibilities - that the tribal cultures make the art/artifact distinction differently or that they do not make it - are just extensions of the fact that the distinction is so unstable in our own culture. From this point, in order to understand the tribal peoples's actual ideas about art and artifacts, we need to follow Dutton's advice and learn more about their culture.
But we must acknowledge, in a way that Dutton does not do explicitly, how such learning is itself affected and even made possible by our preunderstanding. What we are most likely to find is that the tribal objects will confound as much as confirm our art/artifact distinction, which suggests that we are on the right path to attain a correct understanding of them.

In the long run, I think what we do is construct a common art/artifact distinction between ourselves and tribal peoples in the historical, dialogical process of coming to understand each other's cultural objects. Our common distinction, to the extent that it exists at all, is thus a result of our dialogue with them. Satisfied with this distinction insofar as it facilitates mutual understanding, we have no need to regard it as universal.
Rather, it is bound by the context of our dialogue, which is determined in part by our preunderstanding and in part by the historical factors constitutive of the cultural creation of tribal objects.

Now, if the abstraction of tribal objects from the cultural context in which they were originally embedded is part of our commodity practice, aesthetic interest, and art/artifact distinction, it might seem that acknowledgement of this point should inspire us to return to the original or 'pure' context in order to understand the objects better. This is not possible, however, because that context disappeared long ago when we made contact with the tribal cultures; it is now merely an ethnographic ideal.
Moreover, as Price and Howard Morphy have pointed out, when we have emphasized a 'pure' context in dealing with tribal objects, we have traditionally done so to discriminate against them, i.e., to regard them as merely useful objects circumscribed by a narrow cultural context that makes them unfit to be treated as art." Rather than pursue a utopian

TRIBAL ART AND ARTIFACTS 49

or belittling notion of context, we need to critique our preunderstanding of tribal objects in order to comprehend how it shapes the present context in which we experience and understand them. It is this inter-cultural, dialogical context that is most relevant now, for it is here that a correct understanding of tribal objects (and their correct understanding of our art/artifacts) is determined.

IV. DIALOGUE AND CRITIQUE

How does my brief account of our preunderstanding of tribal objects dissolve the dilemma introduced at the start? It does, I think, because our preunderstanding - namely, our commodification of art and artifacts, aesthetic interest, and art/artifact distinction - makes it possible for us, first, to experience tribal objects and, then, to understand them. This preunderstanding is a major though not the sole determinant of what makes the objects we experience what they are; this 'what' is also determined by historical factors in the tribal culture. The part that our preunderstanding determines is more the whether and how we understand than the what.

We might imagine, along with Dutton, that without our preunderstanding we would have less, if any, problem perceiving the distinction between tribal objects; but without it either we would not experience them at all or, if we did, they would be perceptually unintelligible to us. By relying on our preunderstanding, on the other hand, we admittedly have a problem of correct understanding since our preunderstanding may limit us. To eliminate this presumed limitation we might then imagine, along with Danto, that the concepts constitutive of our preunderstanding are universal. But it is virtually impossible to substantiate such a claim.
My alternative to Danto and Dutton has been (1) to acknowledge the historicity of our understanding of tribal cultures in the form of our preunderstanding of them; and (2) to show that we are enabled by, but not confined to, our preunderstanding as long as we critique it when we are in dialogue with the tribal peoples. While Danto over-values our concepts and Dutton over-rates the tribal people's perception, the focus of this dialogue should be the relationship between historical concepts and perception on both sides.

Since I have objected to the alleged universality of our art/artifact distinction, how can I answer the charge of relativism? It may be objected,

50 MICHAEL KELLY

for example, that I have told only one side of the story about tribal objects; for my account says nothing conclusive about whether the tribal cultures regard their objects as art or artifacts, whether they view them differently at all, or whether they view them differently only when they are taken out of context by us, either by force or by trade. Am I indeed a relativist trapped in our preunderstanding of tribal peoples and unable to explain what constitutes a correct understanding of tribal objects?
In response, I must emphasize that to understand tribal objects from the perspective of our preunderstanding does not exclude the possibility of having a correct understanding of them. It is precisely by engaging in dialogue that we escape our own perspective and it is by engaging in critique that we prevent our side of the dialogue from becoming imperial or imperious. Someone from the other side of the dialogue will have to tell us whether we have understood tribal objects correctly or not; it is they, not we, who have to make the relevant conditions of their cultural context part of the dialogue. This is already happening in disciplines - e.g., ethnography, anthropology, art, literature - where the tribal people are speaking for themselves. We will have to engage in this dialogue in more depth before knowing whether our understanding, based on our preunderstanding, is a misunderstanding or not. At the same time, we have to continue to critique our preunderstanding, recognizing its enabling as well as limiting roles in the understanding of tribal objects.

' The first involves scientific testing of the Pot People's and Basket Folk's pots and baskets to find traces of a different chemical or mineral unique to each culture's art; but such a procedure cannot work because, whatever art is, it is certainly not constituted merely by chemicals or minerals. Nor can we rely on aesthetic criteria alone since we can view any object aesthetically, as Marcel Duchamp taught us with his urinal.
