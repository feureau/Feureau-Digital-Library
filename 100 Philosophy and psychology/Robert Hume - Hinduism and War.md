## Hinduism as a separate historical religion arose in a state of war.

The earliest literary document among the sacred scriptures of Hinduism is the Rig Veda, a collection of 1,028 hymns which were used in worship by the Indo-Aryans at the time when they were invading India in the period about 2,000 to 1,500 B.C. The Vedic hymns reflect a state of society which was in constant warfare, even down to the very end of the period. Sometimes those early Hindus were engaged in war among themselves; but more frequently they were at war with the dark-skinned aborigines, who gradually became subjugated.

The hymns of the Rig Veda contain many references to the details of the warfare of the time. The bands of attacking Aryans marched with leaders carrying banners. The soldiers on the march sang and shouted both of the victories of their ancestors and of the aid which had been granted by Indra and Brihaspati and others of the Vedic gods. The leaders usually drove in war-chariots. The main weapons used were bows and arrows and darts. Sometimes the aggressive tribes of Aryans would slay all the population of the villages of the aborigines which they conquered. If the Aryan settlements were attacked by the aborigines, barricades were hastily made out of available trees, and the gods were called upon to give aid. Some of the expeditions of the Indo-Aryans are explicitly described in the Rig Veda as reprisals for the attacks of the indigenes. Sometimes the expeditions were only forays for the purpose of getting cattle. One of the Sanskrit words for "warrior' is gosu-yudh, meaning etymologically "fighting for cattle." One of the Sanskrit words for "battle" is gavisti, the precise etymology of which is "desire for cattle." The early connection of war and Hinduism may be observed in Rig Veda 1.91.23, where prayer is offered to the God Soma as follows:

>Do thou, 0 God Soma, with thy god-like spirit,  
>Victorious, win for us a share of riches!  
>Let none prevent thee! Thou art Lord of valor!  
>Provide for us in the battle [gavisti]!

The only complete English translation of the Rig Veda is by R.T.H. Griffith, The Hymns of the Rig Veda, translated with a popular commentary, 2 vols., Benares, 2d ed., 1896.

It is noteworthy that in the Rig Veda the work of cattle-raiding is expressly likened to the doings of certain of the deities, viz., the deities of the torrential rivers, which so often in India overflow the banks and carry away all movable property; appropriately then is divine assistance invoked by men in such activity (R. V. 10. 30. 10-I1):

>The winding Streams . . . . with their double current  
>Like cattle-raiders seek the lower pastures.  
>Send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches!  
>Give gracious hearing to our call, O Waters!

The aid of the heavenly Ashvin gods is similarly sought and acknowledged in the same kind of marauding border-warfare (R.V. I.II2.22):

>Ye speed the hero as he fights for kine  
>In hero-battle in the strife for land . . . .  
>Ye safely guard his horses and his car.  
>Come hither unto us, O Ashvins, with those aids!

The famous Weapon Hymn (R.V. 6.75) apostrophizes the various weapons of the warrior with praise and prayer as if they were personal assisting deities:

<ol type="1">
<li type="1"> The warrior's look when, armed with Mail,  
He seeks the battle is like a thund'rous rain-cloud.  
Be thou victorious with unwounded body.  
Let the thickness of thy Mail protect thee,</li>
<li type="1"> With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle.  
With Bow be victors in our hot encounters.  
The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foemen.  
Armed with the Bow, may we subdue all regions.</li>

<li type="1" value="16"> Loosed from the Bow's string, fly away,  
Thou Arrow, sharpened by our prayer.  
Go to the foemen. Strike them home.  
And let not one of them be left alive.</li>
<li type="1"> There, where the flight of arrows fall,  
E'en there may Brahmanaspati and Aditi (Two of the Vedic pantheon.)  
Protect us well.</li>
<li type="1"> Whoso would kill us,  
Whether he be a strange foe or one of us,  
May all the gods discomfit him.  
My nearest closest Mail is prayer.</li>
</ol>

The contents of the Rig Veda clearly show that the religion of the Hindus took its historical rise in a state of intertribal and interracial war at the time when the earliest of the so-called Indo-Aryans invaded the Punjab (ie., the Land of the Five Rivers) from the northwest, and gradually subjugated the Ganges basin, and still further extended their dominion southward through the land of Hindustan. In that period the Hindus lived by war and worshiped gods of war, and Hinduism unquestioningly sanctioned and assisted war.

## It was on the basis of successful war that the essential religious social organization of Hinduism was effected.

The professed and unquestionable basis of Hindu society is caste. However, when the ancestors of the modern Hindus first entered India, they did not possess the present caste system. Before the Indo-Aryans separated from their cousins, the Iranians, both those racial branches possessed the threefold form of social organization which in general recognizes "priests," "warriors," and "commons." But the distinctions then were probably not exclusive, unchangeable, hereditary. There is definite evidence that the position of king among those early Indo-Aryans was not always hereditary. Furthermore, it was sometimes the king, and not a priest, who offered the customary sacrifices to the gods before a battle, although sometimes the king would direct a priestly singer to offer the sacrifice. Both the common "cowboys" and the select "kings-men" would participate in the fighting.

Only after the migrating Aryan invaders of India had successfully conquered the new land and had settled down into a permanently agricultural mode of life, and, too, only after they had enslaved the racially different indigenes, did Hindu society become organized into the form of the present caste system. The traditional theory in Hinduism is that caste is an eternal divine institution. But the Rig Veda shows only the beginning of this particular fourfold system. A warring condition of affairs continued for centuries. Perhaps it was for a thousand years that the Aryans fought both Aryans and aborigines before they settled down into a state of society which was determined by varied social and economic, as well as military, influences. However, it is evident that the fourth caste was composed of the autochthonous people, who had been conquered in war, and who thenceforth became incorporated into the new empire of the Hindus on the lowest level. In sharp contrast with them were the three upper castes, who were distinctly Aryans, and who, though socially differentiated among themselves, stood on a common higher plane religiously.

After the conquest the organizing Brahmans and the fighting Kshatriyas regarded themselves more than ever as superior to the mass of the common people; yet both those upper classes recognized the third estate as being of the same racial origin and also as being needed for a base of supplies. Although those priests and warriors prided themselves on their ability as being the spiritual and military protectors of the body politic, nevertheless they felt both the need of, and an affinity for, the great numbers of husbandmen and artisans, fellow-Aryans who composed the Vaisyas or third caste. But all the lighter-colored people of the conquering race felt only a common contempt for the dark-skinned conquered people of the land. These hostile aborigines were designated in the Sanskrit of the Rig Veda as dasyu, i.e., "enemy." Some epithets which are applied to them are: "prayerless" (a-brahman), "godless" (a-deva), "inferior" (adhara), "inhuman" (a-manusa), "unthinking" (a-mantu), "flat-nosed" (an-as), "opposed to religious rites" (apa-vrata), "stingy" (a-prnat), "unbelieving" (a-sraddha), ""not observing religious rites" (a-vrata), "not offering sacrifices" (a-vajna), "impious" (a-yajyu), "easy to be slain" (su-hana), "wicked" (vrjina), "deceitful" (mayavan), "unkind" (a-siva), " the black skin" (krsna tvac).

Twice (R. V. 7. 21.5 and 10.99.3) these contemptible defeated aborigines are called sisna-deva (meaning "whose god is the phallus"). But those early Indo-Aryans, whose own objects of worship had been the superior nature-deities, like the heaven, the sun, the moon, wind, rain, fire, dawn, etc., became one of many instances in the history of international intercourse where a people which had first conquered in a contest of military strength have later succumbed to the force of the ideas, the ideals, the practices of the vanquished. Beyond the peradventure of a doubt those early Vedic Hindus were not idolaters. But under the influence of their despised opponents, viz., the Dravidian aborigines of India, a large proportion of the Hindus gradually became, and still are, idolatrous in their religion. The intelligent educated section of the Hindu community today would repudiate the idolatry which entered into victorious Hinduism from the conquered low castes, and which still prevails, not only among the low-caste people, but also among the women and the ignorant portion of the higher Aryan castes. However, relatively few Hindus today repudiate the system of caste itself.

Both in the long history of Hinduism and at the present time the system of caste has been the main stronghold of Hinduism. With few exceptions, viz., among the progressive modern social reformers, the breaking of caste is the crucial practical test of ceasing to be a Hindu. This characteristic system of caste arose after a successful period of warfare in India had added a despised helotic element to the pre-existent threefold social organization which the Indo-Aryans had shared with the Iranians. In Persia no such religiously obligated caste system arose as in India. Just what was the difference in the two closely connected countries, we do not know. But we do know that in India the complex military, economic, and social enslaving of one people by another more powerful body of invaders was sanctioned religiously; and therewith the entire organization of society became fairly rigidly fixed on what was professed to be a divinely ordained basis.

Neither warfare nor the intricate processes of the differentiation of the existing social groups ceased after the reorganization of the huge population of India under the skilful invaders. Many details of the present-day caste system were developed much later. For example, the originally four main castes have been increasing in number until in India today (as recorded in the last government census of 1911) there exist one hundred and eighty "main castes"; among this number there are at least sixty-four castes each containing over a million souls. Even the highest and most exclusive caste of Brahmans have become subdivided into more than seventy exogamous groups, which can no more intermarry or even interdine with one another than they can intermarry or interdine with other non-Brahman castes. However, it is evident that the main outlines of the present religious-social system of hereditary and mutually exclusive castes arose as the practical outcome of the intricate process of organizing a large population of diverse racial stocks under a common religious and military domination. Whatever subordinate changes have ensued during the growth of the population to the present number of 217,000,000 Hindus, the prevailing system of caste in Hinduism bears upon its very face the early historical fact that caste is a religiously sanctioned form of social organization in which the warring element was next in importance to the acknowledged leading religious element. The astute priestly caste of Brahmans is first and highest. The powerful warrior caste of Kshatriyas is second. Both these castes stand higher in the hierarchy above the husbandmen and artisans (Vaisyas), who form the third main caste. These three main divisions recognize themselves as jointly forming the body of the "twice born" (dvi-ja) who are far superior to all the rest of the population. - This last fourth class of practical outcastes were historically, and still are virtually, slaves. They are not the chattel property of individual owners, nor are they attached to any particular landed estate, as in feudalism; but they are practically in a state of serfdom, being debarred from all social and religious privileges and from many economic privileges ever since the time of the early successful war of the invading Indo-Aryans into India.

## Among the numerous sacred books of Hinduism those which have been the most available to, and the most influential upon, the masses of Hindus have been the two Epics, which, in spite of some beautiful human touches, are in the main a glorification of war.

Although a permanent genetic influence has been exerted on subsequent Hinduism by the complex military, social, and religious situation which is reflected in the Rig Veda, the literary influence of the Rig Veda and of the next chronological groups of sacred scriptures down to the Upanishads has been considerably limited by the fact that all those documents remained the exclusive property of the Brahman priests. Indeed, when the sacerdotal and other castes became thoroughly differentiated and established posterior to the Vedic period, the priests quickly and carefully guarded their sacred texts as peculiarly esoteric. Three of the Upanishads in their concluding section each contain an explicit prohibition against divulging the Secret Doctrine (such is the meaning of the Sanskrit word upanisad) to the uninitiated:

>Let no one tell this to anyone except to a son or to a pupil [Brikhad Aranyaka Upanishad 6. 3. 12].

>Let no one preach this most secret doctrine to anyone who is not his son or else his pupil [Maitri Upanishad 6. 29].

>This highest mystery, delivered in a former age, should not be given to one who is not a son or who is not a pupil [Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6. 22].

These translations are from Max Müller's two-volume translation of the twelve most important Upanishads in the "Sacred Books of the East Series," Vol. I (1879) and Vol. II (1884). There does not yet exist a thoroughly reliable English translation of all the classical Upanishads. A splendid piece of scholarship is the translation into German by Professor Deussen, Sechzsig Upanishads des Veda, (1897, 2d ed. 1905).

Accordingly, the contents of the earliest group of documents in Hinduism, viz., the Vedas, and also of the next important subsequent group, viz., the Upanishads, have not been directly divulged to the laity in Hinduism. That is: the original documents, containing the war-origins and the first speculations of Hinduism, have not been known directly to the great body of Hindus. So, in any historical exposition of the relation of Hinduism with war the significant fact next comes into view that, of all the sacred scriptures of Hinduism those which are best known to the Hindus at large are a group of documents which are even more warlike in their contents than are the lyric Vedas and the speculative Upanishads. Only within the last century have these last-mentioned earliest two groups of Hindu scriptures been translated from Sanskrit into any other language whatsoever. Except the translation of a few Upanishads into Persian, which translation was again rendered into Latin by Antequil Duperron, this latter being the very first means whereby the Upanishads were brought to the knowledge of the West. Indeed, so far as I know, both the Vedas and the Upanishads were translated into European languages by Western scholars before they were made available for the Hindus themselves in any of the modern vernaculars of India.

The sacred books of Hinduism which have long been known and best enjoyed by the Hindus are the two Epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. These Sanskrit poems have been translated into many Indian vernaculars. There is nothing in their contents which is esoteric. They delight the common people with their color and movement, their myths and their fighting. Both of these popular sacred books of Hinduism are martial epics. They narrate at great length the wars of gods and men. The theme of the Mahabharata is the great internecine war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, two branches of the descendants of King Bharata, who is revered as the ancestor of all the Hindus. The theme of the other great epic in India, the Ramayana, is the career of the god Rama. (Probably he was a historical man who through his valorous exploits proved himself to be so much of a deliverer and savior of his people that the Hindus have generally regarded him as an incarnation of deity.) This Ramayana narrates the love of Rama for the woman Sita, the wily capture of Sita by Ravana, the king of Ceylon, and the consequent war which was carried on by the injured husband and which ended in the destruction of Ravana. But after Sita was re-established as queen of Ayodha, Rama became jealous and banished her. The whole story, while it contains some beautiful touches of human affection, is based on rapine and conflict.

Thus the mental and religious pabulum upon which Hindus have been nourished by their best available religious literature continues in the same war spirit in which Hinduism took its historical origin. The Indian Social Reformer, of Bombay, which is perhaps the most influential progressive weekly newspaper conducted by an Indian, contained in its issue of August 31, 1914, a striking paragraph on the subject "Rules of Warfare in Ancient India." In contrast with the fearful outburst of war which appeared in that fateful month of August, 1914, among six of the leading nations of Europe, progressive Indians were recalled to the methods by which war used to be conducted in the good old days of India (when, it might have been noted, India was almost incessantly engaged in war). The historical reference, somewhat idealistically interpreted, is as follows:

>The Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata opens with the question by King Janmejaya to Vaishampayana who is describing to him the story of the Great War. The question is, "How did the heroes, the Kurus, the Pandavas, the Somakas, and other valiant kings who had come to Kurukshetra from various countries, fight the battle?" Janmejaya tells him that all of them came to the great field of battle, encamped themselves, and, before the battle commenced, made certain rules for the conduct of warfare. Janmajaya says: "'They said to one another that the war was inevitable, and they had to fight it out, but they ought not to forget that they were Aryas, and ought not to allow their conduct throughout to be other than fair and manly, so that after the war was over, nothing would rankle in their hearts, and no shock would be given to their feeling of respect and admiration for one another. Let the fight be between equals. Let it be a rule, they said, not to strike those who have withdrawn from the fight. Let a warrior standing in a chariot fight only with another similarly standing; let one riding an elephant, similarly seated; let a horseman fight with a horseman, and a foot soldier with a foot soldier." - These rules made they, the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas; and they and their soldiers became filled with joy and pleased with one another.

Not the propriety of war as such, but only the propriety of certain methods of war, is the moral issue raised by this modern progressive Hindu journal. The Great Epic of India can indeed be cited for moral exhortations to clemency; but far more numerous are the exhortations to win success at any price, even to the extent of committing crimes for the sake of winning. Perhaps the most exact generalization may be formulated thus: Expediency forms the ideal of Hindu morals. Says the Mahabharata: "When the time comes, make peace with a foe; when the time comes, make war against a friend" (Sabha Parva 55).

The continuance of war is the normal state of society, and the appropriateness of war is unquestioned, in those highly esteemed scriptures of popular Hinduism, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

## The question of the propriety of war has never been raised in the whole history of Hinduism, so far as I know, with one possible exception.

A remarkable instance of this attitude is to be seen in an article, entitled "War Philosophy, Hindu and Christian," in the Hibbert Journal for July, 1915, by a prominent contemporary Hindu writer, who closes his comparisons and general discussion on the subject of war with the following conclusion (p. 764): "Human action appears practically in sympathy with Moltke's dictum: 'Perpetual peace is a dream, and it is not even a beautiful dream. War is an element in the order of the world ordained by God. Without war the world would stagnate and lose itself in materialism.' Force guided by expediency still seems to rule mankind, and when the Law of Nature asserts itself, the Law of Nations becomes a dead letter."

That one approach to an exception occurs in the same Epic of the Great Bharata War in the twenty-fifth chapter of the sixth canto. This episode of about 700 stanzas forms perhaps the most famous single literary production in all India. The Bhagavad Gita is a philosophical disquisition curiously set in its context of war. There exist more translations of this "chief scripture of India" (as some of its admirers characterize it), both into English and into the various European languages, as well as into the numerous vernaculars of India, than there are of any other Sanskrit writing. - Perhaps the best translation into English, one which represents the quaint archaic style of the original, is by Lionell D. Barnett (keeper of books and manuscripts in the Oriental Department of the British Museum) in the Temple Classics (1905). The following extracts are taken partly from the aforementioned and partly from The Bhagavad Gita, or The Sacred Lay, translated with notes by John Davies (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co. [1893]). At the moment when a great battle is about to be fought between the two families of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who had been carrying on the feud which fills the whole Mahabharata, one of the warriors, Arjuna, becomes suddenly touched with compunction over the impending slaughter of kindred and friends. Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna, undertakes to counsel and console him. In the midst of war and bloodshed occurs a question, not concerning the propriety of war as such or war against aliens, but only concerning the propriety of war against fellows. It is presented in the form of a dialogue, somewhat after the manner of the Hebrew Book of Job or one of the dialogues of Plato. The interlocutors are Arjuna, the bravest and yet the most tender-hearted of the five sons of Pandu, and Krishna, a divine incarnation, who here appears as a charioteer. After an opening description of the situation at the impending battle, Arjuna is represented in the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita as saying:

<ol type="1" start ="28">
<li type="1" value="28">"As I look upon these kinsfolk meeting for battle, my limbs fail and my face withers.</li>
<li type="1" value="29">"My body trembles, and my hair stands on end. The bow falls from my hand, and my skin is burning. I am not able to stand upright, and my mind is whirling around.</li>
<li type="1">"I foresee no good from slaying my kinsfolk in the fight.</li>
<li type="1">"I desire not victory nor dominion nor delights. . . . .</li>
<li type="1" value="34">"I do not wish to kill-though I myself be slain-even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds, how much less for that of earth!</li>
<li type="1">"If we slay these, what joy can then be ours? It is not meet for us to slay these our kinsmen.</li>
<li type="1">"Even if they whose minds are stricken by grief see no evil in the destruction of a tribe or in the oppression of friends, . . . .</li>
<li type="1" value="38">"Should we not resolve to turn away from their sinful deed? . . . .</li>
<li type="1" value="44">"Alas, we have resolved to commit a great sin-we who are striving to slay our kindred, from the lust of dominion and of pleasures.</li>
<li type="1" value="45">"It were better for me if the Dhartarashtrans, with arms in hand, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed, in the fight."</li>
<li type="1" value="46">Thus having spoken, Arjuna sat down on the seat of his chariot in the field of war; and he let fall his bow and arrows, for his heart was heavy with sorrows.</li></ol>

Thus ends chap. i, entitled "The Despondency of Arjuna." Here is a noteworthy expression of the high moral sentiment of willingness even to be killed rather than to do a certain wrong. Chap. ii continues:

<ol>
<li type="1" value = "2"> The Lord spake: "Wherefore, O Arjuna, hath come upon thee in a difficulty this vile depression, unmeet for one of noble race? </li>
<li type="1">  "Yield not to unmanliness. It becomes thee not. Cast off this faintheartedness, and arise, O destroyer of foes."</li>
</ol>

Still Arjuna objected to fighting, urging:

<ol><li type="1" value="6"> "We know not which is the better lot for us-that we should conquer them, or that they should conquer us. If we should slay these, we should not wish to live. .</li>
<li type ="1">"I am stricken with pity and with guilt, confused in mind. Pray tell me, which is the better course?"</li></ol>

Now begins the philosophical part of the poem on the meaning of life and the Hindu ideal of duty. Remarkable indeed is the way in which the ethical problem of the propriety of killing people is answered by a discourse on the immortality of the soul:

<ol><li type="1" value="11">Then the Lord spake: "Thou grievest for those who need no grief, though thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve not for the dead or the living. . . .</li>
<li type="1" value="18">"These bodies are called the mortal bodies of the eternal, the imperishable soul. Wherefore fight, O son of Bharata.

<li type="1" value="19"> "He who thinks this (soul) to be a slayer, and he who thinks that it can be slain-both are undiscerning. - This (soul) slays not, nor is slain.

<li type="1" value="20"> "It is never born, and it never dies. Unborn, undying, eternal, this (soul) is not slain when the body is slain. . . . .

<li type="1" value="22"> "As a man, having cast off his old garments, takes others that are new, so the embodied (soul), having cast off the old bodies, enters into others that are new.

<li type="1" value="23"> "Weapons cleave it not, nor does the fire burn it. The waters wet it not, nor do the winds dry it up.

<li type="1" value="24"> "The soul is undying, eternal.

<li type="1" value="25"> "Wherefore, knowing it to be such, thou oughtest not to grieve for it. . ...
<li type="1" value="31"> "Regarding too thy proper duty, thou oughtest not to falter; for to a Kshatriya [i.e., a warrior] nothing is better than a lawful fight. . . . .
<li type="1" value="38"> "Accounting pain and pleasure, gain and loss, victory and defeat as equal, gird thyself for battle. Thus wilt thou not bring sin upon thee.
<li type="1" value="39"> "When by means of this teaching, thou hast become devout, thou wilt cast off the bonds of work [or action, karma.]"
</ol>

This then is the answer which is given by Krishna, the most popular incarnation in Hinduism, to the conscience-stricken Arjuna when the latter stopped to consider the bloody deed in which he was about to engage: Do your traditional caste duty, irrespective of killing anybody. According to the pantheistic theory, which is the prevailing type of philosophy in Hinduism, empirical distinctions like killing and dying are not applicable to the eternal soul. Therefore pity need not be wasted on the soul of an opponent lest he be injured in a fight. On the other hand, from a practical point of view, it would be most sinful for any Hindu to fail to discharge all his caste duty. In the case of the inquirer, who was a member of the Kshatriya or warrior caste, his appropriate duty is evidently to engage in death-dealing warfare.

Thus the only time that the question of the propriety of war is even approached in the literary history of Hinduism the most sacred handbook of devotion in that religion, the unrivaled gem of Hindu philosophy, ethics, and religion, viz., the Bhagavad Gita, justifies war with a speculative as well as with a practical justication.

## The most authoritative code of law in Hinduism enjoins warfare conducted with every available form of injury, as being not only the expedient self-interest, but also as the proper religious duty, of a Hindu ruler.

A progressive modern Hindu social reformer is troubled by some of the atrocities of war (though not by the fact of war), and an episode from the Mahabharata can be cited reporting some precisely retaliatory methods which were adopted in one of the wars in past Hinduism. But for the formulated enactments of Hinduism with regard to war there exists a more authoritative code than an epic poem, viz., the Law Book of Manu. The seventh chapter of the elaborate "Manava-dharma-Sastra" sets forth, among the duties of a Hindu king, the following:

<ol>
<li type="1" value="87"> A king who is defied by foes must not shrink from battle, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas [i.e., the second, or warrior caste]. . . . .</li>

<li type="1" value="89">. Those kings who, seeking to slay each other in battle, fight with the utmost exertion, and who do not turn back, go to heaven. . . . .</li>

<li type="1" value="102"> Let him [i.e., a king] be ever ready to strike, his prowess constantly displayed, his secrets constantly concealed. Let him constantly explore the weaknesses of his foe.</li>

<li type="1" value="103"> Of him who is always ready to strike, the whole world stands in awe. Let him therefore make all creatures subject to himself, even by the employment of force. . . . .</li>

<li type="1" value="110"> As a weeder plucks up the weeds and preserves the corn, even so let a king protect his kingdom and destroy his opponents. . . . .</li>

<li type="1" value="171"> When he knows his own army to be cheerful in disposition and strong and that of his enemy the reverse, then let him march against his foe.</li>

<li type="1" value="180"> Let him arrange everything in such a manner that no ally, no neutral, nor foe may injure him: that is the sum of political wisdom. . . . .</li>

<li type="1" value="195"> When he has shut up his foe in a town, let him sit encamped, harass his kingdom, and continually spoil his grass, food, fuel, and water.</li>

<li type="1" value="196"> Let him likewise destroy the tanks, ramparts, and ditches. Let him assail the foe unawares, and alarm him at night.</li>

<li type="1" value="197"> Let him instigate to rebellion those who are open to such instigation.</li>

<li type="1" value="200"> Let him, duly exerting himself, fight in such a manner that he may completely conquer his enemies.</li>

<li type="1" value="201"> When he has gained victory, let him duly worship the gods and honor righteous Brahmans.</li>
</ol>

Quoted from pp. 230 ff. of The Laws of Manu, translated by G. Biihler, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1886 (= Vol. XXV of the "Sacred Books of the East Series"). The same text has been translated by Jolly in Trübner's "Oriental Series." The Manava-dharma-sastra in its present form probably dates from about 200 A.D.

Such are some of the historical connections of Hinduism and war as set forth in the sacred books of Hinduism.

In addition to this historical résumé of the connection of Hinduism with war as indicated in the sacred books of Hinduism itself, there is one more important associated fact which may be cited on the subject.

## Except for Buddhism there has been no formal denunciation of war among the religions of India.

The most successful of several indigenous protests against Hinduism has been Buddhism. One of its cardinal virtues is non-injury (a-himsa). The first Buddhist ruler in India, Asoka (reigned about 264-228 B.C.), came to believe that war in itself is unholy. Late in life he wept for the thousands whom he had slain. For some centuries after the repentant Asoka there followed a relaxation in India of the characteristic Hindu belief in the divinely ordained right to kill. But subsequently Hinduism succeeded in evicting Buddhism from what is now British India. The Census of the Indian Empire shows ten million Buddhists, but they are mostly in Burma, which is only administratively a part of the Indian Empire. "The only survivors of purely Indian Buddhism are the small community in the Orissa States known as Sarak, of whom nearly two thousand claimed to belong to that religion."-General Report of the Census, 1911 [1914], p. 125. With this one exception Hinduism has met no indigenous rival religion in India which has ventured to denounce war.

Thus Hinduism and every other ethnic religion in India, except Buddhism, has maintained a religious sanction for war.
