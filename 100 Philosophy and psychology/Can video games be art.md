Artists, gamers, designers, historians and critics answer the question that has become emblematic of the clash between technology and culture

In April, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert posted a blog article entitled "Video games can never be art". Within minutes, the feeding frenzy began. Responses ranged from intellectual objections through to classic online flaming. Many angles were argued, but one viewpoint stood out: that you cannot analyse the art behind video games without having actually played them.

Then Ebert relented a little. In a follow-up piece entitled "OK, kids, play on my lawn", posted in July, he conceded that while his opinion had not changed, he had made his criticisms of video games without experiencing them for himself.

Now it is time to put the matter to people who do have personal experience of the medium. Here game designers, along with a mixed bag of art critics, journalists, academics and historians - all of them avowed gamers - tackle a question that is emblematic of the clash between technology and culture: can video games be art?

People tend to mean several things by this question. First, can video games be sold by art dealers, appear in galleries and museums and be an accepted part of the art world? They already are: just look at the creations of Cory Archangel, Mark Essen and Eddo Stern. Second, can video games tackle difficult issues and sensitively present us with different perspectives? They already have: see the work of Terry Cavanaugh, Jason Rohrer, Molleindustria and Tale of Tales, and commercial games such as Bully (also called Canis Canem Edit) and Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit). Finally, can video games present an experience of aesthetic beauty that is particular to the medium? Indeed they do: see Tetsuya Mizuguchi's Rez, a game dedicated to Kandinsky and which I first discovered and played in the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York. It's a great time for those interested in this question to see what work is already out there.

Many artistic elements go into the creation of video games. I find it impossible to experience the wit and elegant technical skills of Bioshock with anything less than admiration for its creators' artistry. Moreover, video games offer storylines that can be compelling. They also introduce another personality into the mix: that of the gamer.

But in my encounters with gaming - playing Grand Theft Auto IV, for example - I have found that my presence has done nothing to make the total dramatic experience deeper or more affecting. So if Grand Theft Auto is a work of art, my own oafish contributions to it have been positively deleterious. Maybe I need more practice. Even then, I'm not sure I could raise the fun of machine-gunning the odd gangster to the level of the best plays, novels or movies.

Consider Shakespeare's Othello. Why should I imagine for a moment that my having an ability to intervene in the play could make it better? Would a happy ending - Othello and Desdemona singing a love duet, with me seated behind them strumming a harp - be an improvement on Shakespeare? Video games are good fun, but why do they need the validation of being called "art"? Isn't being fun enough?

I don't think there's any aspect of human life that can't be art. Art happens when we reach for the very largest framework for our values, when we go beyond commercial concerns, or concerns about status or coolness, and reach for some level of meaning that just might transcend the problems we know how to articulate. Yes, it can happen in video games, though I don't think it happens often. But then, how often do books or movies reach the level of art? Not that often, if we're honest.

Marcel Duchamp once said, "I have come to the conclusion that while not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists." Gaming and play bear an interesting relationship to art. Like art, play is experimental, creative, flexible and immersive. It is done for its own sake. And like art, games can challenge and transform us. So can video games be art? They certainly incorporate many artistic elements: painting, architecture, music, sculpture, acting, writing, animation and dance.

The games that feel more like art tend to have qualities in common. They do not pander to the player; they are mysterious; they feel more serious than most games; they have a complete, holistic feeling. Such games are rarities, but they exist, and as the form evolves, just as cinema did, more and more of them will appear.

The 20th century saw the following celebrated as art: a urinal placed on a stand, a painting of a coloured square, poetry made of words taken randomly from a hat, an audience cutting the clothes off an artist, industrial paint thrown onto canvas, reproductions of commercial advertisements, a telegram asserting that it was a portrait of its recipient, a barricade of oil barrels on a Paris street and live television images of a Buddha statue. Lest we conclude that these are outlandish examples, consider the artists who produced them: Marcel Duchamp, Piet Mondrian, Tristan Tzara, Yoko Ono, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and Nam June Paik, respectively. All are celebrated, their status as artists never questioned.

Art has done many things in human history, but in the last century it has primarily tried to provoke us, to force us to see things differently. So maybe we should ask, "How are video games changing our ideas about art?" If the purpose of art is indeed to force us to see something we thought we understood in a new light, perhaps the most fundamental move video games have made in the artistic tradition is in the very eliciting of the question, "Can video games be art?"

Look beyond the cultural values assigned to video games and art, and you'll see many similarities between them: both are leisure pursuits, neither are obviously utilitarian, and both are hubs of deeply engaged subcultures. But there are differences: games require direct engagement and what you might call co-authorship between the designer and the player.

All this poses the question of why we are concerned with giving video games the status of art. Are we simply trying to legitimise them? Does being called "art" change the qualities of video games? Only if we can answer these questions can we move the conversation forward.

## Tom Bissell, Author of Extra Lives: Why video games matter (Pantheon 2010)

I think "Can video games be art?" is the wrong question. The right question is whether artists can use the video game medium as a viable means for creative expression. Games use storytelling, imagery, character, incident and music, sometimes all at once, to elicit emotion from their players. Some games do this well and some games do not. It's possible that no video game is ever going to measure up to Hamlet, but then again Hamlet is not going to provide you with quite the same effect of a game. A similar question bedeviled film for its first 50 years. Film proved itself. Games will too.
