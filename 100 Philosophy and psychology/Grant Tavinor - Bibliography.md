Research interests relevant to game philosophy: My research focuses on the relationship of videogames and the arts. I have written on games and art, fiction, narrative, interactivity, ethics, the ontology of games, games and performance, and the definition of videogames. My book The Art of Videogames connects the study of games to traditional issues within the philosophy of the arts.

Keywords: Videogames, fiction, art, narrative, ethics, ontology, definitions, performance.
