## Acknowledgments

This work has grown out of experiences and friendships that have spanned many years and many miles. For those experiences and for those friendships I am grateful to a number of individuals and institutions. When did this work begin? Was it some twenty-five years ago with my first experiences of Javanese culture through the study of gamelan music at Wesleyan University? Or was it in California and then in Java where I continued my study of the Javanese performing arts under the auspices of the American Society for Eastern Arts in the 1970s? It was during these early trips to Java, in 1971 and 1975-77, that I began my study of narrative traditions in Java, working under shadow puppet masters and beginning my studies in the manuscript archives of Surakarta, Central Java. I remember those many long nights, sitting motionless, enthralled by what seemed to me the near magical performances of the puppet masters as they spun their tales. To these Javanese storytellers, especially to Ki Anom Suroto and to the late Ki Suratno Gunowiharjo and the late Ki Sutrisno, I owe my fascination with Javanese narrative, with Javanese language and literature. My first encounters with Javanese manuscripts were in the library of the Mangkunagaran Palace and were encouraged by the late K.R.M.T.H. Sanjoto Sutopo Kusumohatmodjo, for whose many years of support and friendship I am deeply grateful. Others who influenced and shaped my early experiences in Java were K.R.T. Wasitodiningrat, the late R.L. Martopangrawit, the late Embah Jarwopangrawit, and the late Suranto Atmosaputro.

In 1978 I returned to America to begin graduate studies in Southeast Asian history at Cornell University. To my teachers at Cornell, especially to Oliver Wolters, David Wyatt, Benedict Anderson, and James Siegel, I owe a deep debt of gratitude. The opportunity to read with them both their own works and the works of others contributed to shaping my perspectives on writing and my approaches to reading. I am particularly indebted to Oliver Wolters; the inspiration that his work has provided me and the fellowship that his friendship has afforded me have been guiding forces in my scholarly life over the last seventeen years.

When I returned to Java in 1980 it was as field director of the Surakarta Manuscript Project, a project to microfilm manuscripts in the three royal manuscript repositories that are located in the ancient court city of Surakarta. Through this project, which was generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Cornell University Southeast Asia Program, I had the opportunity to go over almost three-quarter million pages of writing in Javanese script as I prepared the manuscripts for filming. My work on the manuscripts was made possible by the gracious permission of their Royal Highnesses I.S.K.S. Pakubuwana XII and the late K.G.PA.A. Mangkunagara VIII, as well as by the support of the late K.R.M.T.H. Sanjoto Sutopo Kusumohatmodjo, the late K.G.P.H. Prabuwijaya, K.R.T. Hardjonagoro, and the National Archives of the Republic of Indonesia. Others whose efforts were indispensable to this project were: David Wyatt, Haryati Soebadio, the late K.R.T. Mohammad Hoesodo Pringgokoesoemo, the late M.Ng. Kirnosayono, R. Pranadi Hartawiryana, Alan Feinstein, Mulyoto, M. Husni Djasara, and Bambang Hening Tjipto. Then in 1982, through a project that was funded by the Ford Foundation and was housed in the Sasana Pustaka Library of the Kraton Surakarta, this work was extended to preserve the original manuscripts as works of art on paper. I am very grateful to friends and colleagues who worked with me on that archival project at the Surakarta Palace, especially to G.P.H. Puger, G.R.A. Koes Moertiyah, Endang Tri Winarni, and Kasmir Efendi.

Meanwhile, in 1982, with the generous funding of the Social Science Research Council and a Fulbright-Hays fellowship and with the sponsorship of the Lembaga IImu Pengetahuan Indonesia in Jakarta, I began the field work on Javanese historiographical traditions that would eventually culminate in this book. A number of friends and colleagues influenced the course of that field work. At the Kraton Surakarta I am grateful to G.K. Ratu Alit, G.P.H. Poespohadikoesoemo, G.R.A. Koes Indriyah, the late K.R.T. Sastradiningrat, and Ibu R.T. Pamardi Srimpi for their assistance and advice. I am also deeply indebted to John Pemberton, B. J. Rianto, Thoriq Addibani, Tinuk Rosalia Yampolsky, and Halim HD.; their insights, energies, and fellowship enriched my understanding and informed my perspectives during those years in Surakarta.

I began writing this book at Cornell in 1986 and wrote substantial portions of it there and at the University of Michigan over the next four years. During this period I learned from conversations with and comments and criticisms from Benedict Anderson, Judith Becker, Suzanne Brenner, Audrey Kahin, Victor Lieberman, John Pemberton, Takashi Shiraishi, Ann Stoler, Amrih Widodo, Thomas Williamson, Oliver Wolters, and David Wyatt.

In 1993-94, with generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan, I was provided the opportunity to reconceive and rework this project. A number of friends and colleagues commented on portions (and in some cases entire drafts) of the work as I was rethinking and rewriting it. Thanks here are due to Alton Becker, Katherine Bergeron, Joseph Errington, Valentine Daniel, Robert Hefner, Marilyn Ivy, Daniel Lev, Hendrik Maier, Adela Pinch, Vicente Rafael, Laurie Sears, Mary Steedly, and Amrih Widodo. I am also grateful for the editorial encouragement of Ken Wissoker of Duke University Press, and for assistance with maps and figures from Robert Cowherd, Ron Fraker, Annabel Gallop, and Adhi Moersid. The publication of this volume is supported with a grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research of the University of Michigan.

I am especially grateful to John Pemberton for his many and significant contributions to the writing of this book. Were it not for his insights and friendship I would, I am quite sure, have written a very different work. I have him to thank not only for encouraging my early interest in Java but also for, many years later, challenging me to take a critical stance on that same interest. Through his own writings as well as his criticisms of mine, he has enriched my understandings of Java in countless ways. And for his many and detailed comments on nearly every draft that this book has been through, I am truly grateful.

Finally a note of special thanks to my son, Joshua Nurhadi Suryolelono Florida, to whom I dedicate this book, with much love, in the hope that when, many years from now, he comes to read it, he will understand why I wrote it.

## A Note On Manuscripts Spelling Pronunciation And Translation

Most of the original Javanese manuscripts referred to in this book are from three repositories in Surakarta, Central Java: the Sasana Pustaka in the Kraton Surakarta, the Reksa Pustaka in the Mangkunagaran Palace, and the Museum Radyapustaka. Citations of these manuscripts include two reference systems. The initial "MS." reference refers to the catalog entry of the local repository (with "SP" for the Sasana Pustaka, "RP" for the Reksa Pustaka, and "Rp" for the Radyapustaka). The "SMP" reference is based on the cataloging system of the Surakarta Manuscript Project. In this system, "KS" refers to the Kraton Surakarta, "MN" to the Mangkunagaran, and "Rp" to the Radyapustaka. A complete bibliographic entry with author, title, place and date of composition and inscription, and double references appears as follows:

Ronggasasmita, Mas. Suluk Acik. Composed Aceh, 1815; inscribed Surakarta, 1867. MS. SP 15 Ca; SMP KS 502.

In many cases the provenance and dating of the manuscripts cannot be established. The abbreviation "s.a." (sine anno) indicates that the date is unknown; "s.1." (sine loco), that the place is unknown. Attributions are in brackets.

Microfilm copies of the Surakarta manuscripts are available for reading at the originating repositories and at the Indonesian National Archives in Jakarta as well as at Cornell University Library's Echols Collection and at the University of Michigan. The first of a four-volume annotated catalog for these manuscripts, my Javanese Literature in Surakarta Manuscript, vol. I: Introduction and Manuscripts of the Karaton Surakarta, was published by the Southeast Asia Program, Cornell University in 1993.

In addition to the Surakarta manuscripts, I also refer to several manuscripts from the Oriental Collection of the Leiden University Library and from the Oriental and India Office Collection of the British Library. The abbreviation "LOr" indicates Leiden Oriental manuscripts; "IOL" indicates India Office Library manuscripts.

My spelling of Javanese words follows, with some exceptions, the system standard in Indonesia today. The exceptions are as follows:

1. l distinguish the taling (é or è) from the pepet (e).
2. I spell and transliterate Javanese proper names as their owners do or did. I do not, for example, follow the standard academic Javanological spelling of "Ranggawarsita" for the poet Ronggawarsita.

The spelling of Javanese words, on the whole, reflects pronunciation.
The following list gives the nearest English equivalents to the sounds represented by the letters:

|Letter | Approximation in English |Example|

INTRODUCTION:

ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAVA

By day and night, read with care and diligence All the venerable laid-by works

That they may be exemplars Of the language of the heart, be not deceived

If you lack the time, read then every night If by night alone Study with utmost loving care

Feel their meaning and their intent

Bring out their sense, dare to try to comprehend If confused

Or if they seem too simple -Mas Ronggasasmita, 1815

Almost two centuries ago Ronggasasmita, a little-known writer from a

well-known family of Javanese court poets, composed these lines calling his readers to active and careful readings of exemplary works no longer

read." He urges readers to approach the old texts with a kind of loving care, or quiet passion, that would provoke contemporary understandings

1. Mas Ronggasasmita, "Suluk Martabat Sanga," in Suluk Acih (compiled Aceh, 1815; inscribed Surakarta, 1867), MS. Sasana Pustaka Karaton Surakarta (henceforth SP), cat. no. 15 Ca; Cornell University Surakarta Manuscript Project (henceforth SMP), cat.
no. KS 502, p. 55.

2. Mas Ronggasasmita was the son of K.-T. Sastranagara (RK.Ng. Yasadipura II, 17561844) and the grandson of R.Ng. Yasadipura I (1729-1803). Ronggasasmita's elder brother, R.Ng. Ronggawarsita II ("Sepuh*"), who held the office of Mantri Lurah Carik Kadipaten, was the father of the renowned court poet R.Ng. Ronggawarsita III (18021873). Implicated in revolutionary activities, the elder Ronggawarsita was exiled along with his younger brother "Mas Kaji" (Ronggasasmita?) in 1828 (Babad Sengkala kang kaurut saking kagungan-dalem serat Babad [composed and inscribed Surakarta, circa 1831, 1847], MS. SP 6 Ta; SMP KS 1C.7, II:127).

of their meaning and intent. The poet challenges readers to work toward

comprehension, to learn that textual meaning is not a self-evident given served up for their passive consumption. And so he dares them to read in ways that will involve them in the active production of meaning-to enter into dialogue with the half-forgotten texts of the past. "Try to comprehend," Ronggasasmita writes in words that also mean "take up and extend the language" of the texts, thereby subtly reminding readers to work toward meanings that will be partially of their own, that is, our own, making."

These lines appear in Ronggasasmita's Suluk Acih (Songs of Aceh), a compilation of Islamic mystic songs, or suluk, written by the poet as he languished on foreign shores. Having made the holy pilgrimage to Mecca, Ronggasasmita was on his way home to the Central Javanese court-city of Surakarta where illustrious members of his family served the Pakubuwana ("Axis of the Universe") kings as professional literati. He was traveling with his uncle. When the two men reached the Sumatran port city of Aceh, the older man fell ill. It was then that Ronggasasmita took up his pen to reinscribe in Javanese verse the mystical teachings of his Sufi masters." And in that text, written during a Sumatran interruption in his journey home to Java, the poet recalls prior texts expressly to call for their

reactualization in present and future readings.
In the same poem Ronggasasmita goes on to remember one very spe3. The Javanese lepiyan ("venerable laid-by works") designates a written text which is no longer read, but has been laid aside (folded up) to be preserved-perhaps as a prototype for further copies. Old Javanese lepih means "to fold; double the sum, twice

the amount" (P. J. Zoctmulder Old Javanese-English Dictionary, 2 vols. [The Hague: Nijhoff, 1982] [henceforth Zoetmulder], 1:1014). Modern Javanese lepik means "to spit s.t. out" and by extension "to reject s.t. one had previously accepted or taken into

consideration" (J. F. C. Gericke and T. Roorda, Javaansch-Nederlandsch Handwoordenboek, 2 vols. [Amsterdam: Muller, 1901] [henceforth GR], 2:1 34). For an imaginative reading, teasing from the word lepiyan the connotation of "an ornate protest," see

J. Anthony Day, "Meanings of Change in the Poetry of Nineteenth-Century Java" (Ph.D. dissertation, Cornell University, 1981), pp. 275-76, 279, and 302.

4. The Javanese nyambut-nyambut, which | render as "try to comprehend," is the reduplicated form of the verb sambut ("to take up, to grasp; to borrow; to take up [s.0.'s|

words, to reply, to continue [s.0.'s] language").
5. Ronggasasmita was a member of the Shattariyyah tamq with an educational genealogy (silsilah) extending back to 'Abdallalh ash-Shattar (and ultimately to the Prophet Mohammad]. That genealogy included Seh Abdul Raut of Singkel and S&h Kaji Muhyi

of Karang (Mas Ronggasasmuta, Suluk Acth, pp. 52-55).

2 INTRODUCTION

cial reader. The poet reports of his late grandfather, the renowned Kraton Surakarta (Surakarta Palace) writer Yasadipura I (1729-1803):

And though already famed a master of knowledge

Yet would he have with him The wali's vencrable laid-by works And those of the perfect masters

I saw him on those nights When he had no guests

Once resting from his writing Nothing else was seen by him

Save suluk and Sufi texts.�

Recalling his famous grandfather surrounded at night by Sufi texts, Ronggasasmita is in effect admonishing his own readers to be mindful that successful writing is the fruit of thoughtful readings. For although the preeminent writer of his day, Yasadipura never ceased his readings of the "venerable laid-by works" that others had written. And what he read, according to Ronggasasmita, were the works of the Islamic saints credited with the conversion of Java-the wali-and "the perfect masters," their spiritual and intellectual heirs. "But nowadays," Ronggasasmita goes on to complain, there are many who neglect these texts and yet presume to teach, offering misleading thoughts on matters that they themselves little understand. Ronggasasmita's imagined punishment for these false and arrogant teachers: stuff their mouths with rocks, seven fistfuls each."

This book responds to Ronggasasmita's call to return to works of the past by undertaking a close reading of one such work-Babad Jaka Tingkir, or "The History of Jaka Tingkir"-a singular and hitherto overlooked nineteenth-century Javanese writing of history that I came across in the library of the Surakarta Palace in early 1981 as I was cataloging all the manuscripts in that royal archive." The text, written in the nineteenth

century about a sixteenth-century past, was bound into a volume of diplomatic correspondence belonging to an exiled Surakarta king. This curiously positioned history veritably demanded my attention, while promising to compel my repeated returns to it. Even upon first encounter, Babad Jaka Tingkir, which its writer "composed as a magic talisman,"" seemed to anticipate and propel the future traces of its own potential readings. There was no escaping it, and since that day I have returned many times to this prophetic writing of Javanese history. My work here is an extended historical and literary exploration of this extraordinary text. I trust that my efforts will not have earned me a mouthful of rocks.

My project involves situating, translating, and critically analyzing the hauntingly prophetic Babad Jaka Tingkir. It is, in short, a close reading of a particular text of Javanese historical writing which was itself produced with an eye toward its own potential future readings. I begin with reflections on reading practices in Java, in the past and in the present. I then

consider historically the writing of Babad Jaka Tingkir by way of an introduction to the focus of my study: a translation of the manuscript in its

4 INTRODUCTION

entirety. This is followed by an analysis that moves in dialogue with the translated text to consider how this text makes sense in the contexts of its

realities, textual and otherwise. My own reading of Babad Jaka Tingkir is

very much engaged in this history's production of sense, for it is a reading that is self-consciously interested in the extension of this text's prophetic script for the future. In other words, my book is an attempt to perform just the kind of reading that Ronggasasmita seems to have had in mind.
Such a reading is itself a form of writing-a textual practice that involves the reader along with the text (and by implication that text's author) in a dialogic production which moves to realize the potential meanings that the text itself apparently intends. In a voice that perhaps would not have seemed alien to Ronggasasmita, Roland Barthes has noted that textual works are themselves "perpetual productions, enunciations through which the subject continues to struggle; this subject is no doubt that of the author, but also that of the reader."'" The reader, partially undone by the text that she reads, struggles together with its author and through its perpetual productions to realize its work in her own reading of it. With the writing of this book as a practice of such reading, I thus attempt a dialogic encounter with a Javanese past, a text of that past, and the alternative futures that text suggests for the present. This encounter emerges, of course, from the interplay of various subjectivities across time, space, and languages-from the particularities of my own personal history and the realities inscribed in a specific work of Javanese historical

writing to the potential readers that that work, and mine, would address.
The primary site of this interplay, this intensive reading, emerges from the work of translation. Hence, a translation of the entire text of Babad Jaka Tingkir is central to this book. For only by considering the composition of a particular Javanese writer in its entirety could I hope to discern the voices from the past that would make possible the dialogic encounter of which I speak. Indeed, it is only by allowing the text of this Javanese

writer sufficient room to shape the contours of my own discourse, through

10. Roland Barthes, "Theory of the Text," in Untying the Text, ed. Robert Young (Boston: Routledge and Keagan Paul, 1981). p. 42. Reading, for Barthes, as a work of signifiance is a form of writing. Me signals the eroticism of such reading/writing as a "work, not the work by which the subject (intact and external) might try to master the language . . . but a radical work (which leaves nothing intact) through which the subject

explores how language works him and undoes him as soon as he stops observing and enters it" (p. 38)

5 ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAVA

translation, that I might resist both the pretense of "speaking for" Javanese subjects and the presumption of authority that would found a more monological narrative of Javanese history. And, it is precisely by engaging a particular text through translation that I am also brought into a more expansive dialogue with a range of other texts and other Javanese pasts.
For the text that I read was itself composed against a background of readings, of prior texts and contexts. Translating Babad Jaka Tingkir in full, I am compelled to attend in a sustained manner both to its profound intertextuality and to its historicity, to the stylistic, linguistic, and literary modes through which its writer, in the particular reality of his or her historical becoming, worked to generate its senses. Through the work of translation I consider how the writer worked, prophetically, through other texts-moving strategically among various literary, historical, and political contexts-to indicate what might lie beyond them. Translating this historical prophecy thus has meant learning to hear and respond to its writer's modes of signification and their historical determinations, in order to produce-to recall Walter Benjamin's formulation-reverberations of these in my own writing as translation."

The project of this book, then, is not simply to use indigenous texts to reconstruct a history of Java; it is rather to engage a particular Javanese text in an extended historical conversation in order to follow up on that text's own prophetic tendencies and to imagine with it a historical space for the future. The point is not to master the Javanese past or a text of that past but to reinscribe, through dialogue, a particular text's apparent future intentions. In a text like Babad Jaka Tingkir, that is, a text that announces itself as prophecy, such future intentions are especially haunting.
My own reading and translation appear drawn up into this particular text's afterlife, extending its future intentions into a world that was, perhaps, not completely unforeseen by its prophetic Javanese author." The translation proceeds from this prophetic history to generate, with it, a larger discursive space in which its future senses might move. For by

11. The task of the translator, according to Benjamin, is to produce an "echo," a reverberation of the original in the language of the translation (Waiter Benjamin, "The Task of the Translator," in Hluminations [New York: Schocken Books, 1969}, p. 76). It is worth noting here that Benjamin's apologia for translation was itself written as a preface to his own translation of Baudelaire's Tableaux Parisiens.

6 - INTRODUCTION

opening this hitherto obscure "Third World" history to a whole range of readers who would otherwise have no access to it, the translation works quite concretely to push the limits Babad Jaka Tingkir now endures as a

marginalized Javanese-language composition in a literary world that is dominated by Euro-American writings. Through translation, the remarkable Tingkir history enters into a wider comparative dialogue, where, read with interest not only by Javanese and Javanists, it can extend its prophetic potential into a more global register.

Imagining how Babad Jaka Tingkir, translated, might perform its work within the larger discursive spaces of a global comparative dialogue elicits further consideration of the political implications of this project. What might it mean to translate an "exotic" text under the postcolonial conditions of the late twentieth century? Whose interests does it serve to introduce an obscure text from a "Third World" literature into English?
There are, of course, no unambiguous answers to these qustions."} I would hope, however, that by foregrounding the text of a marginalized Southeast Asian writer, I might just provoke a stutter in the universalizing projects of a dominant discourse that effaces marginal voices even as it would speak for exoticized others. Babad Jaka Tingkir, a text that itself both explicitly and implicitly questions the centrality of any center that would attempt to exclude margins, is perhaps uniquely suited to interrupt such projects. Through the translation of this particular Javanese text-a translation produced by writing across differences instead of against difference-I wish to introduce into the dominant discourse the potentially subversive agency of the authorial subject who composed it.

How, then, do I envision the practice of translation? If by translating the text of Tingkir in full I mean to work with it rather than on it in an imagined mastery of it, how do I account for the proverbial violence the act of translation may perpetrate upon an other's text? I certainly cannot fancy my translation an innocent reproduction of some original indige13. For extended and thought-provoking studies of the politics of translation, see Vicente L. Rafael, Contracting Colonialism: Translation and Christian Conversion in Tagalog Society under Early Spanish Rule (Durham: Duke University Press, 1993 |orig., 1988]), and Tejaswini Niranjana, Siting Translation: History, Post-Structuralism, and the Colonial Context (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992). For a penetrating discussion of the {moral) position of the critic in postcolonial discourse on the "Third

World," see Edward Said, "The World, the Text, and the Critic," in The World, the Text, and the Critic (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983), pp. 311-53.

nous meaning. It goes without saying that my translation of this nineteenth-century Javanese writing of history is itself an interested rewriting of the "original" it translates. This translation, like any translation, is a rewriting, a writing-again which is at the same time an act of reading by a historically determined, desiring subject-a writing-again across languages, literatures, cultures, and times that is itself located in the history of the conditions of its own production.'*

Pure, unmediated translation is, of course, impossible. And it is this very impossibility that necessarily involves translation, intimately, with the worlds in and through which it moves. Reading not only across but also through differences, translation obviously can never hope fully to recover or to convey an originary meaning. Nor does it offer a locus of total expressive freedom. Rather, it is a practice which works through the senses of the imagined original in order to generate novel senses. Instead of a transparent reproduction and relay of an original truth, translation is a task, as Benjamin understood, that strives in dialogue with the original to realize and extend the potential truths the translated text apparently poses. Any translation is always both textual interpretation and textual supplement. And all translation is located in history. So I do not imagine my translation of this text-however invested I am in it-to be the last word on the text of Tingkir. Indeed, by offering it in translation I hope (if I

may presume to ally myself with Ronggasasmita) to encourage others to read, that is, to "dare to try to comprehend" this and other of the "venerable laid-by works" of Javanese writing.

Babad Jaka Tingkir

Babad Jaka Tingkir, the history of Jaka (or "the Youth from") Tingkir, is an epic history that concerns the emergence of Islamic power in Central Java.
It is also a historical prophecy. Composed in indigenous sung meters and inscribed in Javanese script in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, Tingkir is an anonymous work. There is apparently only one manuscript witness of this singular history: I found that witness of the Javanese

Hendrik Maier, writing eloquently of the historical reception of Malay literary texts, reminds us that all readings, and rereadings, and readings of readings, are [ragmentary and selective; and that all readings bear with them traces of the centers of culture out of which they are produced (In the Center of Authority [Ithaca: Cornell

past tucked away in a volume of royal correspondence whose home is now the library of the Surakarta Palace. As shall become apparent, this anonymous manuscript was inscribed (if not composed) by the mysterious hand

of one associated with that same palace-but not, as it turns out, the hand of one actually at court. For the hand that inscribed Babad Jaka Tingkir belonged to a marginalized subject who wrote the history as he or she languished, in political exile, on a distant island remote from his or her royal Javanese origins. It is in light of this discovery that this book begins to explore the relationship between the poem's prophetic foresight and the exile of indigenous power in colonial Java: that suggestive point where exile and prophecy, along with writing and history, converge in the textual work of a particular nineteenth-century Javanese subject.

With Babad Jaka Tingkir, a prophetic Javanese poet composed the history of a critical period in the Javanese past: the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, a period that saw the transition from the ancient

Hindu-Buddhist East Javanese regimes to the beginnings of Central Javanese Islamic hegemony. The poet wrote that history with distinctive style.
For unlike texts of the more dominant tradition of Javanese history writing, this text does mot chronicle a dynastic history preoccupied with the doings of kings and their armies in linear narrative fashion. Rather, this poem interrupts the dominant genealogical style of the dynastic chronicle to treat the past episodically, to generate a novel genealogy of the future.
Rather than focus on the genetic antecedents of the ruling elite of his or her present-day Java, the poet writes, in a series of episodes, the stories of a handful of peculiar characters on the margins of the dominant literary, historical, and cultural traditions. These episodes, written from the vantage of exile, are deftly bound together to engender a new historical force

which would emerge through contestation, rather than merely descend along royal bloodlines. Inscribing a new future out of a traditional past, the epic discloses a novel history whose effectiveness is self-consciously

projected onto suggested tomorrows.
The Babad Jaka Tingkir motivating this book, this extended historical conversation, is certainly not the only history of Jaka Tingkir that was

written in nineteenth-century Java. Nor is it the only historical prophecy.
It is, however, perhaps the only history of Jaka Tingkir from which the famous "Youth from Tingkir" (legendary founder of the first of Central Java's inland Islamic kingdoms) is significantly absent. My reading of the text suggests that this absence discloses the revolutionary kind of future

9 - ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAVA

this historical prophecy writes for the Javanese past. Instead of writing a conventional foundational history of the "Youth from Tingkir," this history invokes the emergence of an alternative future: an alternative "Tingkir Youth" who might reign, not as yet another founding father, but as a sign of empowered margins, as a figure for new youthful forms of power.
Rather than register a recuperation of past reality in the name of "objective truth" (as do many conventional master-narrative historical projects of the West), or a reinscription of the imagined pasts of dynastic presents with an eye to continuing traditional status quos (as do many of the more mainstream works of indigenous Javanese history), this text constructs an alternative past which, countering its oppressive colonial present, would move toward more autonomous, perhaps even liberating, futures. The text was written, | argue, to indicate to its readers a context out of which might emerge a profoundly changed future for Javanese history. And the implications of this contextualized text can be extended far beyond the world of nineteenth-century traditional Java to foreshadow possibilities, and to critique processes, still at work in contemporary Indonesia today.

Reading in Traditional Java

Before turning to Babad Jaka Tingkir in its contestatory particularity, 1

would first like to consider the nature of reading, and writing, in Javanese pasts and presents. In this discussion I will use the semifictional categories

"traditional Java" and "the modern world," not as substantive entities but as fragile constructs that serve to delineate differences between conceptual orders that emerged in time through history. By "traditional Java," I mean the nonunitary discursive world in and through which a wide variety of Javanese subjects lived over a roughly 250-year period that closed (more or less conclusively) in 1942 with the Japanese invasion of Java and the consequent sudden end of Dutch colonial domination. A world that was generated and regenerated under the conditions of colonialism, traditional Java became recognized by emerging Javanese subjects as "Javanese" over the course of the nineteenth century."" This heterogeneous

and diverse world (or better, these worlds) became fixed as "traditional"

after the fact, toward the beginning of what would later be considered its end; for "traditional Java" as such was born toward the end of the nineteenth century; and only in the face of its potential recession before its

presumed opposite, "the modern world." What do we know of literate audiences in the semifictional entity that I

am calling "traditional Java"? How might we characterize the relationships among Javanese subjects and Javanese writings in these former times? Was literacy in traditional Java restricted to the insular members of a tiny elite class, an elite separated from and surrounded by a sea of illiterate peasants? Or was the traditional reading public a somewhat

more popular and potentially populist entity ?
Despite the abysmally low rates of literacy in Java preceding the 1945 Indonesian national revolution, the "literate" audience for written texts

was not as small as might be imagined.'* The great majority of texts written in the prerevolutionary era were composed in macapat meters which were (and are) meant for sung performative readings and hence for melodic aural consumption." Indeed, even the solitary reading of these texts entails the intoning of the melody in the reader's mind. Sometimes

the melodic phrasing of the poetry in performance actually determines the sense of a given passage.'* Although solitary readings of these texts were clearly important to the professional literati (and others) who in16.

Anthony Reid's discussion of the remarkably high level of literacy across Southeast Asia in the early premodern period (Reid, Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450-1680, vol. 1, The Land below the Winds [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), pp. 215-25).

scribed them,"" the majority of readings of macapat texts in the prerevolutionary period were performed aurally by Javanese as they listened to public textual recitations, and it is precisely because of the usually public and oral performative nature of traditional Javanese textuality that the notion of literacy, at least as far as macapat texts are concerned, should be understood to have a different meaning in the context of prerevolutionary Java. The literate audience of Java's past included persons who were "illiterate" in the narrower sense of the word, and yet, through practiced and sensitive listening, had become highly conversant with literature.
Where, then, were some of these scenes of reading? And who were the audiences? Public recitations of texts were standard fare in the palaces of Central Java until relatively recent times. Notably, nightly macapat reading of texts entertained, up to the 1960s, large, fluid, and heterogeneous groups of court servants in the Kraton Surakarta. The texts were recited by the so-called "voice guards," male members of elite corps of military guards, who sang by turns throughout the night, every night except on Wednesday and Saturday nights when they were preempted by shadow play performances.*" Seated behind a low table at the edge of the palace's open Sasana S�waka throne pavilion (figure 1), they read by flickering oil lantern, singing from a wide variety of texts that were selected from the

same royal scriptorium that now houses what appears the sole manuscript witness of Babad Jaka Tingkir."'

were not resident at court; daily (or nightly) when their shift was done, they recrossed the palace walls to return home to their villages or urban

neighborhoods, bearing with them what they had heard."

Traditional Javanese writing, sometimes misnamed "court literature," has always had a life that extended well beyond the palace walls." There is, for example, ample evidence that much of what is now called "court literature" grew out of and through textual traditions in the rural Islamic educational institutions, or pesantre�n, of Java. Indeed, it is a little discussed fact that all Java's most renowned "court poets" were products of (among other things) Islamic pesantren educations." These court poets knew firsthand the classical literary prowess of the orthodox Islamic masters of the

provinces."" They also knew by personal experience the popularity of macapat recitation in these provincial institutions of Islamic learning. It is not surprising, then, that we find among the texts of nineteenth-century court literature detailed descriptions of readings of Javanese poetic and

musical accompaniment, dancing Dutch mevrouws, and drunken toasts at the close of nearly every verse.

other works at pesantr�n. Careful readings of these descriptions reveal the surprisingly diverse audience the traditional texts enjoyed in rural Java, an audience that included both men and women, and comprised teachers, pupils (or santri}, and neighbors of the pesantren in which the reading was

performed.*"

Although the court and pesantr�n were crucial sites for the proliferation of traditional Javanese literature, persons associated directly with neither of these institutions were by no means excluded from the practice of reading (or of writing, for that matter). Among Javanese villagers, the recitation of macapat texts has been, and sometimes still is, a regular feature at certain ritual events, such as at the celebration of the birth of a child."" There is evidence which suggests that reading (or listening) was

even more popular among the masses in the nineteenth century, though it is questionable (to some) how much they understood of what they

read or heard. Take, for example, the evaluation of common literacy in C. F. Winter's elitist Javaansche Zamenspraken (Javanese Conversations), a textbook for Dutch students of Javanese language and literature which was compiled around 1840 at the Surakarta Institute of Javanese Language."" In Conversation 35, the Dutchman Tuwan Anu (Mister So and So) asks his prospective Javanese teacher, Gunawan, why "the Javanese"

like reading so much if they don't understand what they are reading.
Gunawan answers:

As for the priyayi [the bureaucratic elite}, they are only interested in the story without troubling themselves with what the words mean.
For most of the commoners, [reading] is just a prop to keep them awake so robbers won't come. As for the readers themselves, they usually don't know anything beyond the story-line; they don't understand a lot of the words. I'm not just talking about Kawi [Old Javanese or archaeized literary Javanese] texts either-given even

ordinary Javanese texts, those who could really explain [what they're

reading] are rare indeed. So all that singing ringing out in the night is nothing more than the night guard or maybe somebody showing

off his voice to the neighbors-so that they'll be impressed that he can read and that he has a good voice."

I wonder. That most readers-listeners were not attending to, nor perhaps understanding, the discursive meaning of every word of any text most certainly does not exclude the possibility of their having intelligently read that text. The active process of reading, that is making sense, of any text includes much more than being able to come up with appropri30. Winter, Javaansche Zamenspraken, 1:58.

16 INTRODUCTION

ate glosses for unfamiliar words-perhaps especially in the case of traditional Javanese poetic forms in which textual sense is somewhat more

sensuous and somewhat less literal. Reading-listening was undeniably a pleasurable activity to some nineteenth-century Javanese commoners (figure 2). And it was at least interesting and engaging enough to keep them awake, all night.

The popularity of reading among the common folk is attested to in Zamenspraken's Conversation 69, in which Mister So and So is visited by the young poet Kawiswara ("Voice of Kawi"), who having heard the Dutchman is in the market for the classics, has come to sell him a Kawi manuscript. Kawiswara himself is not the owner, but is acting as middleman for a poor boarder he knows. The owner's asking price is a ream of good Dutch paper. Also working for Mister So and So and present at that time was the elder court poet Kawireja (roughly, "Rich with Kawi").
Kawireja considers the unusually well-preserved condition of the manuscript for sale:

That's because he never read it and none of his neighbors ever borrowed it-none of them could have understood its words. Usually Javanese books which are frequently read and frequently lent out aren't that clean. They may have oil spilt on them and be all stained with betel chew or other filth. Using a cigarette butt to mark his place,

when the reader gets sleepy, he uses the book for his pillow [emphasis added]."

Evidently the pleasures of going to bed with a good book were not unknown to Javanese in former times. Scenes of reading in nineteenthcentury Java were many and varied." What was read was also much more

varied than is sometimes imagined today.

that make up this universe were, for the most part, inscribed in Javanese script and composed in Modern Javanese language, rather than Old Javanese or Kawi. Most of these texts were written in the 250-ycar period that ended with World War II and the Indonesian national revolution.
These various textual works (and constellations of textual works) compose the discursive formations that delineate traditional Javanese writing, formations that apparently emerged among writers in eighteenth-century protocolonial Java and that retreated (almost finally) with early twentieth-century Java's turn toward modernity. It would be foolish to characterize "in general" what these writers wrote about, for their texts embrace a remarkable range of Javanese interests. Their writings-which include historical chronicles and documents, erotic lore, Sufi speculative lyrics, scripts for shadow-puppet plays, compendia of court lore, and manuals of magical practice-range, for example, from treatises on Islamic theology and law to manuals of horsemanship, from poetic histories of the Napoleonic Wars to catalogs of magic daggers, from moralistic platitudes on virtuous wifely behavior to inventories of royal liquor cabinets."

33. For more on the diversity of the writings comprising this body, see vol. 1 of my Javanese Literature in Surakarta Manuscripts, pp. 15-21.

18 - INTRODUCTION

Almost all the texts that today's Javanese call tradisional would have been originally written, that is composed and inscribed, in Javanese script: the traditional literature of Java is, for the most part, a manuscript literature. As I mentioned above, a majority of these texts are composed in macapat verse forms written for sung performative readings. The language of many of these texts, though Modern Javanese, includes an admixture of archaic Kawi vocabulary. The texts tend to be written in a linguistic style which marks them as "literary" in distinction from the language of ordinary speech. Many, but by no means all, of the texts that make up this literature were written by persons in some way associated with the royal palaces of Central Java.

Despite the heterogeneous reality of these texts, there is, nevertheless, still a utility in pointing out certain characteristics that highlight the difference of writing traditionally in Javanese script from modern writing-both in the West and in Indonesia. How are we to understand this difference? What did it mean to write, to be a writer, in traditional Java?
How is the notion of author related to the reality of text in this chirographic literature? At the outset, it is important to note that the words used in Java to designate "writer" do not share with English (and French) the cognate "authority" of the modern author. The Javanese words for "writer" connote a rather different status for "the textual worker" (ingkang akarya sastra) than does the modern Anglo-French author. The Javanese "writer" (panulis, panyerat) may be the person who physically writes or inscribes (anulis, anyerat) any text, the "scribe" by whose hand the written artifact is produced. Then again the writer may be the work's "composer" (panganggit, pangiket): she/he who "interlaces" ({nganggit) and "binds together" (ngiket) words or texts in textually productive manners. Significantly, in traditional Java there is no clear distinction between these two categories of writing: that is, writing as physical replication of prior inscription and writing as original composition. On the one hand, the scribe enjoyed a modicum of poetic freedom in his or her "copying" (nurun, nedhak) of texts, which often engendered new variants and versions of old texts. On the other, the composer, working within conventions of Javanese textuality, would sometimes borrow (or "translate") from older works, interlacing (nganggit) and rebinding (ngiket) old textual fragments into new contexts to create his or her "original" work.

A dramatic illustration of this form of composition is a text which is

19 UN THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAYA

today perhaps the best known of Javanese poems: the Kalatidha (Time of

Darkness). Kalatidha was written by R.Ng. Ronggawarsita (1802-1873), a nephew of the Mas Ronggasasmita who would have unread writings read. This most famous of poems, written by Java's most famous of poets, laments the oxymoronic impotence of perfect royal power in high colonial Java. Sometimes bruited as this "last of the court poet's" late-nineteenthcentury expressive signature of the end of traditional Javanese power, * the poem is actually a rather more complicated reflection upon indigenous potencies. Composed of a cunning repetition of an early-nineteenthcentury prophetic lament on future moral decline, which is interlaced with an inverted quotation about power's past excellence from that same earlier work, and then punctuated by the poet's own drolly provocative observations, Kalatidha is in effect a strategic translation of an old prophecy into a new prophetic context. The earlier work from which Ronggawarsita borrowed, or translated, is the Cabolang-Centhini, a work widely reputed to be "the first Javanese encyclopedia." "* As it turns out, this "encyclopedia" itself is a profoundly intertextual work composed, in part, out of borrowings from and allusions to a host of still earlier works. My point here is not to expose the Kalatidha (or the Cabolang-Centhini) as derivative, but rather to point to the very intensely self-conscious intertextuality of Javanese writing. Indeed, none the less original an expression because of its intertextual reality, the meaning of the Kalatidha is doubly complicated as both a signature of the end of tradition and a critical commentary upon and reconfirmation of tradition's prophecy of its own end.

20 INTRODUCTION

While not claiming the originary authority of authorship, writers in

traditional Java were, however, often active participants in rather different forms of potency. Writing was a highly esteemed practice, and a practice that was self-consciously involved in its own worldliness, its being-in-the-world or circumstantial reality." The best of the traditional writers-like Ronggawarsita, who is today revered as the last of the true court poets (or pujongga)-wrote with an acute awareness of the potential power of their words in the world. These writers wrote strategically to produce considered effects in the sociopolitical milieus in which they wrote. They meant to produce texts which were prophetic not just as records of already determined foreseen futures, but rather as kinds of writing whose very inscription itself could (or would) materially effect what was to come. Often writing about the very distant past, the sometimes anonymous pujongga wrote these texts of material prophecy selfconsciously to affect the practical and political realities of both the historical presents in which they wrote and the imagined futures toward which they wrote. They wrote and rewrote history, not just after the fact, but also before and in suggestive anticipation of it." Composing their works in the profoundly intertextual and reflexive world of writing in traditional Java, prophetic writers constructed their texts to contest and transform prior texts and contexts into something quite novel and often yet unknown. The orientation of such texts, original works composed out of, against, and as comments upon other texts, could be an as yet indeterminate future waiting beyond the horizon. Babad Jaka Tingkir is one such text.

37. On this notion of worldliness, see Said, "The World, the Text, and the Critic," esp.
Pp. 34-39.

38. CF. C. C. Berg's discussion of "verbal magic' in the writing of Javanese dynastic histories from the eleventh through cighteenth centuries ("The Javanese Picture of the Past," in An Introduction to Indonesian Histortography, ed. Soedjatmoko et al. [Ithaca: Carnell University Press, 1965], pp. 87-117). Berg imaginatively argues that the professional poet-historians worked self-consciously-in the service of their (sometimes neo-) royal employers-both to impose and to effect (sometimes novel) dominant ideologies. He implies that when these poets wrote and rewrote history to effect their (sociopolitical) verbal magic they did so in a manner that intentionally distorted "the truth" (as an extralinguistic reality). My understanding of the work of the pujongga, though similar to that of Berg's, considers the work of these poets a less devious practice.
It is my sense that the pujongga themselves realized in and through their work the discursive nature (the living historiaty) of "reality" itself.

"Traditional Javanese Literature": A Colonial Heritage

The potentially radical genius of writing in traditional Java has not been realized in contemporary Indonesia. Conversely, this writing as "Traditional Javanese Literature" is apprehended instead as an inscribed monument to the refined quietism of an ever receding classical past. This apprehension has its own history-a history that 1 shall begin exploring in the Javanese present with the consideration of a peculiar kind of absence.
A curious modern reality: although perhaps more highly esteemed than ever, the actual texts of "Traditional Javanese Literature" are today almost unread."" In this modern age of increasing literacy among Javanese subjects, and of increasing devotion to things "traditional" in New Order Indonesia, the sometimes extraordinary texts composed in traditional Java remain, for the most part, laid by on the shelf. Ronggasasmita's 1815 call to active reading with which I inaugurated this chapter has, it seems, been frustrated. Why, and how, has this come to be the case?

In late twentieth-century Indonesia, "Traditional Javanese Literature" is popularly understood as a particular genre of beautiful writing, a genre of elite {royal) writing characterized by difficult or esoteric texts of great refinement and philosophical depth: that is, Literature with a capital L. As a result of this generic misunderstanding, the diverse constellations of heterogeneous writings produced by a variety of writers in Java from the eightcenth through the carly twentieth century have come to be reduced and confined (as Literature, or Kesusastraan) under the unitary, objectified category of "beautiful tradition" (tradis? yang adiluhung). Javanese writing of the past has thus been essentialized into an acstheticized object of tradition, a fantastic object whose contours are determined by (as they in turn help to determine) conventional wisdom on the nature of "Javaneseness." A construction of consciousnesses over time, the Literature, as object of tradition, is for most Javanese subjects today an imaginary ideal-or a spectral reminder of a vanishing past-rather than a diverse

field of concrete inscription to be read.

which as we shall see is an image of rebirth and return as well as of refinement and exclusion, are to be found in nineteenth-century Dutch

colonial philology. Dutch philology on Java was born in the second quarter of the nineteenth century along with Durch consolidation of its first truly colonial authority over the island. These new colonial developments followed in the wake of two determinative moments in the colonial history of Java. The first of these moments was the temporary displacement of Dutch power on the island by the British from 1811 to 1816. As well as initiating institutional changes which transformed the political landscape of the colony, the British interregnum also saw the beginnings of scientific interest in native culture and litcrature.*� Dutch administrators, upon their return to power in Java, were not blind to the usefulness of this new knowledge and in the coming decades strove to emulate British scholarship, citing in particular the proven political utility of British cultural policies in India."" Dutch authority now saw how "understanding the natives" could facilitate both the civil administration of-and the efficient extraction of profits from-what was, at long last, becoming a true colony.

The second critical moment in the colonial history of early-nineteenthcentury Java was the final defeat of indigenous Javanese royal power that marked the end of the Dipanagara War in 1830. It had been a devastating war. Led by a Javanese prince and supported by a network of rural Islamic teachers, this last concerted Javanese rebellion against colonial authority (prior to the Indonesian national revolution) raged five years and claimed

Weatherbee's "Raffles' Sources for Traditional Javanese Historiography and the Mackenzic Collections," Indonesia 26 [(October 1978]:63-93). What was novel about Raffles' work was its scientific form and especially its publicity. With Rafflies' History, "Java" became a proper subject for Anglo-European Orientalism.

the lives of over 200,000 Javanese-as well as the lives of some 15,000 colonials.* The experience of that war demonstrated both to the colonial authorities and to their subjects the fury that could be unleashed by "the natives" when mobilized by their elite under the banner of militant Islam.
Having won the war, Dutch power would henceforth work to consolidate its authority in a way that would foreclose a recurrence of such fury.
Already defeated militarily, after 1830 the final subjugation of the Javanese was to be sealed by a colonial strategy which would depend in part upon the cultural isolation and cooptation of the indigenous elite. As long as the indigenous elite could be held in colonial service, while at the same time held away, in a kind of cultural reserve, from both the masses and the sinister forces of "fanatical" Islam, Dutch authority, it was hoped, would reign supreme.

This strategy of control involved the implementation of a colonial cultural policy which worked to portray a sense of cultural remove on the part of the elite. Much of this policy, for instance the preservation and inflation of Javanese sumptuary practices to shore up sagging elite status and dignity, was quite studied and deliberate." Other aspects of the policy were more implicit to the colonial project and less considered. The result of unconscious assumptions and wishful thinking, these other aspects assumed a certain logic of invisibility, what might be thought of as a structure of not seeing. This "not seeing," which was taking command of colonial perceptions in the 1830s just as the institution of forced cultivation was inaugurating the high colonial period of Dutch power on Java, worked to contain Javanese subjects within an ideological construct that would later become "traditional Javanese culture."" That construct was

Ricklefs, of the 15,000 lives lost by government troops, 7,000 belonged to "Indonesian" soldiers and 8,000 to Europeans (A History of Modern Indonesia [London: Macmillan, 1981], p. 113).

articulated in part through a delineation and identification of high Javanese culture as an entity standing in opposition to Islam and as the exclusive and conservative preserve of a hyper-refined elite class. For among the realities necessarily invisible in this field of colonial vision were the Islamic and subaltern presences within even the most privileged sites for the articulation of such a culture. And in post-1830 Indies' scholarship, the Kraton of the Susuhunans (Kings) of Surakarta was positioned as the most authoritative of these sites, as the truest, and therefore most reserved, exemplar of pure Javanese high culture.** Not seen, then, were the Islamic pesantr�en educations of this palace's court poets, the Islamic content of its court literature, and the myriad commoners who populated its court society.

Nineteenth-century colonial scholarship was dominated by the discipline of philology. Language and literature, philology's proper objects, came to enjoy a favored position in the emerging image of Javanese high culture. In 1832 a colonial Institute of Javanese Language and Literature was established in Surakarta; it was there that the discipline of Javanology first began to take shape. The moving forces behind the Institute were a small group of Dutch-and especially Indo-European-philologists who enjoyed strong ties both to the colonial government and to the Kraton Surakarta. It was through the energies of these men that the canon of what was to become "the literature of Java" began to emerge. At the same time, and often through the hands of these same philologists, hundreds of

Javanese manuscripts were migrating westward to form the beginnings of what would eventually grow into a massive colonial literary archive in

45. The issue of the Surakarta Palace's position as the last and best preserve of Javanese culture still rages. Witness the extensive national (and international) media coverage of the "scandalous," and ultimately failed, project to build a five-star international hotel within the Kraton walls That project, which was to have been financed by one of President Socharto's sons, was widely condemned as a violation of the Surakarta Palace's sanctity as a "cultural reservation" {cagar budava). See, for example, Asia Week (23 October 1992); Far Eastern Economic Review (1 April 1993); NRC Handelsblad (24 October 1992 and 20 February 1993); Kompas (25-26 September 1992); Editor (12 September and 31 October 1992); and Tempo (17 October 1992).

the Netherlands.* Because of the paired privileging of literature and of the Kraton Surakarta by the early colonial scholars, what these men imagined to be the literature of that court came to be a crucial factor in the framing of Javanese culture."" The implications of that frame are particularly evident in the history of Javanese literature produced by colonial, and also postcolonial, philology.**

As a classical discipline, colonial Javanological philology is preoccupied with the quest for golden ages, periods of alleged literary florescence succeeded by periods of decline or decadence. Such philology teaches that Javanese literature attained the zenith of its sophistication and aesthetic value in the distant pre-Islamic past with the classical Hindu-Buddhist Kawi literary culture. This classical culture is said to belong to the serial glorious courts of the Old Javanese heartland. Its products, the Old Javanese kekawin (poetic texts composed mostly in East Java from the ninth through the fifteenth century), are the closest things to genuine originals in Javanese literature; the real originals, however, are not to be found in Java at all but in the Indian subcontinent, which produced the Sanskrit prototypes on which the Old Javanese poems were based."" The classical discipline of philology teaches that the robust florescence of Old Java's literary culture was crushed by the coming of Islam in the late fifteenth century. Islam's coming meant the destruction of the old high culture and

the pollution of its language and literature with the alien sounds and senses of Arabic. Philology calls what followed a long period of darkness,

characterized by an Islamic literary culture coming out of the pasisir area

(the northern littoral of Java)." It is said that the pasisir authors of the middle period produced derivative, and sometimes degenerate, texts on "foreign" Islamic topics.

For much of the seventeenth century and nearly the entire first half of the eighteenth century, the royal heartland of Central Java was torn apart by a series of dynastic, and other, wars. It is said that Javanese literary activity, presumably an activity proper to stable courts, ground to a near halt during this period of political chaos. Then in 1745, after the sack of the previous capital, the Dutch helped their ally, the reinstated king of Mataram, build a new court-city on the banks of the Solo river." That new city was called Surakarta Warfare continued unabated, however.
Finally, in 1755, the Central Javanese situation, it is said, was normalized with the Dutch-overseen partition of Old Mataram into the twin realms of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Peace and prosperity, we are told, at last came to Central Java."

The philological canon teaches us that with this late eighteenth-century pax Nederlandica, Javanese literature came to experience a kind of rebirth at the new Surakarta palace, a rebirth that effected a partial recuperation of the lost greatness of old Java's literary culture. This renaissance is conventionally thought to have expressed itself most perfectly in the court poets' translations of the Old Javanese Kawi classics into Modern Javanese verse.
Theodore Pigeaud, one of the greatest of the Dutch philologists, states

succinctly the meaning of the rebirth as "the turning of the attention of Javanese scholars from Islamic texts to Old Javanese kakawins."" In effect:

because the poets finally turned away from "foreign" Islam toward their

native Javanese Hindu-Buddhist origins, Javanese poetry was reborn unto itself. It was to be, however, a short-lived rebirth (or, perhaps, but a stillbirth). For by the latter part of the nineteenth century, colonial philology had decided that the famed neoclassical productions of the Surakarta renaissance were "bad," as it were, translations. The renaissance would be declared dead, and with it newer classical literature as a serious art form.

In 1860 A. B. Cohen Stuart published the first systematically prepared philological edition and annotated Dutch translation of a Javanese literary work."" That work, the Serat Bratayuda, was a late-eighteenth-century Modern Javanese translation of a twelfth-century Old Javanese classic kekawin, which classic was itself a translation of the climax of the Sanskrit Mahabharata epic. The Modern Javanese version was composed by the man who is conventionally acclaimed the father of the Surakarta renaissance, the man who is thought to have fathered the rebirth of presumably dead Javanese letters from the grave in which the Moslem conquest had cast them. This man was Yasadipura I, Ronggasasmita's famous grandfather, the one who had been so fond of reading Sufi texts.

As it turns out, Cohen Stuart produced his philological work on Yasadipura's text with considerable embarrassment-and only because he was under orders from his civil service superiors at the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences to do so. The philologist's prefatory remarks to his

edition of this neoclassical Javanese text abound with apologies to his readers for subjecting them to such decadent, confused, and bastardized

material. He would have much preferred, he explains, a commission to

prepare an edition of the poem's much superior twelfth-century prototype. Disparaging Yasadipura's comprehension of Old Javanese as well as his literary skills in Modern Javanese, this father of Dutch colonial philology goes so far as to deplore the late king of Surakarta's choice of one so ignorant as Yasadipura to translate the fine kekawin classic into Modern Javanese verse. In the same vein, the philologist complains of the ignorance of his own "native informant," whose services, nevertheless, were doubtlessly indispensable for Cohen Stuart's Dutch translation of the poem. His disparaged "native informant" was none other than Yasadipura I's own great-grandson, Raden Ngab�hi Ronggawarsita (180254. A. B.

1873), who is regarded by Javanese today as having been the greatest of

all Javanese literati.

After Cohen Stuart, Dutch philology turned its attention away from Modern Javanese to Old Javanese literature. Although nonacademic editions of Modern Javanese literary texts were still published (presumably as "appropriate" reading material for a small class of print-literate Javanese-and for Dutch colonial service trainees), these newer works were rarely considered worthy subjects for "serious" (read Dutch) scholarship." Judged hopelessly involuted and derivative by the brokers of intellectual power, the new Javanese texts did not sell on the Dutch East Indies philological marketplace. Thus with the publication of the very first scholarly edition of a Modern Javanese literary text, the image of what was to become "Traditional Javanese Literature" was fixed in the halls of colonial scholarship as a monument to moribund involution.

And yet despite and alongside this disillusionment among scientific philologists of the later nineteenth and the twentieth century, the image of the neoclassical writing of the "Surakarta Renaissance" as the quintessential expression of high Javanese culture, quite remarkably, persisted especially among romantic colonial officials "in the field." What the academic philologists meant to reveal as confused and garbled language, the romantics would see as expressions of the refined inscrutability of the elite native soul. For these romantics, the imagined neoclassical royal

$5. According to Uhlenbeck's bibliography of Old Javanese and Javanese Literature, twenty-one text editions of Modern Javanese works and no editions of Old Javanese works were published by Dutch and Indo-European philologists in the seventeen-year period 1843~60. In the following seventy-nine years, the Dutch and Dutch-trained philologists published thirty-one editions of Modern Javanese works. Only a handful of these publications might be characterized as serious philological works. During the same seventy-nine-year period, the Dutch and Dutch-trained philologists published forty (serious) text editions of Old Javanese works, many of them Leiden University dissertations. See Uhlenbeck, A Critical Survey of Studies on the Languages of Java and Madura, pp. 145-73. '

A notable exception to this scholarly disregard for Modern Javanese texts, however, was the continuing interest of Dutch scholars in the earliest Islamic texts in Java. Sec, for example, the Leiden doctoral dissertations of J. G. H. Gunning (1881), B. J. O.
Schrieke (1916), and H. Kraemer (1921). Especially important in this regard have been the philological works of G. W. J. Drewes; see, for example, his The Admonitions of S�h Bari (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1969) and An Early Javanese Code of Muslim Ethics (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1978).

writing of Surakarta, perhaps because it was seen as a dying and involuted form, best confirmed the "beautiful tradition" of Old Java, a tradition which colonial power would work to preserve and conserve.

This essentialized image of traditional Javanese writing as a desirably involuted neoclassicism came to take on a kind of truth. For although this narrow image does not in fact conform to the much more heterogeneous reality of written production in traditional Java, that image has, nonetheless, impressed itself into the reality of Javanese history. Such an image is, after all, a useful one. Generated in part by Dutch and Indo-European scholars whose interest was to understand the Javanese in order better to

rule them, the neoclassical image of "Traditional Javanese Literature"-we should remember-first began to take shape in the aftermath of a devastating war waged against emerging colonial order by self-consciously Islamic opponents. The image was drawn, strategically, according to the philological romance of (pre-Islamic) golden ages and (non-Islamic) renaissances. It was and is an image which sees in the neoclassical writings of "Traditional Javanese Literature" a happy (if not totally successful) return, via texts, of the Javanese to their own native greatness, that is, to their timeless (docile) selves away from the interruption of Islam's sinister (political) messages. Internal to the logic of this image is the assurance that colonial order was ultimately responsible for the blessed return of Javanese writing to its "original truth.""* The image, which had special appeal for the apologists of colonial authority, became in turn the intellectual

property of emerging modern colonial subjects. In late-twentieth-century Indonesia it is still a variety of this image of "Traditional Javanese Literature" that reigns supreme."

56. Benedict Anderson has suggested to me that among Netherlands East Indies intellectuals the philological ideal of the golden age was part of an ideological construct to justify the act of "colonization" or, better, the practice of empire. The imperial rationale of philology was as follows. "Our" colonized people at one time enjoyed a high civilization, which has since fallen into decay. In the case of Java, "Hindoo-Java's" decay was a direct result of Islamo- Arabic pollution and destruction. It was, then. both the right and the duty of the colonial power to bring that high culture/civilization back to its subject people; hence another buttress for the rectitude of the greater imperial "mission."

j0 INTRODUCTION

On "Traditional Javanese Literature" in Modern Indonesia

The neoclassical image of "Traditional Javanese Literature" that prevails in the popular consciousness of late-twentieth-century Indonesia is articulated by Javanese subjects in two quite opposite (and interrelated) idioms.
There is a tendency among today's Javanese to apprehend their traditional literature either as feudal fossil or as classic icon. The first image is one that emerges in the ostensibly modern or progressive consciousness, in the imaginations of those who view their traditional literature as an embarrassment, as the hopelessly conservative inscriptions of a self-indulgent and fatuous elite class. Calling the literature of the eighteenth and nineteeth century feudal or f�odal, the progressive consciousness dismisses the writings of the Javanese past as summarily as had the colonial philologists who followed Cohen Stuart. The old writing inscribes the voice of decadence, a voice not worthy of being heard. Javanese writing thus apprehended means death, and underwrites the death of Java.

It is, however, the other contemporary image of "Traditional Javanese Literature," that of the classical icon, that is the dominant one in the discourse of late-rwentieth-century Indonesia. Modern devotees of "traditional" texts, venerating these writings as classics, imagine them icons of high culture, mysteriously inscribed jewels from a rich cultural inheritance. And, as is probably true of acknowledged classics anywhere, such an exalted status is testimony to how little these texts are actually read.
However, in modern Java the logic of the classic has achieved peculiar perfection in the contemporary image of traditional literature as ideally illegible writing, writing which is treasured precisely for (what is considered) its essential inaccessibility. Again, the association of the writing is with death: the classic standing as an indecipherable monument to a remote and essentially irrecuperable past.

of "Traditional Javanese Literature" in today's Indonesia are the Yasadipuran Brarayuda, Rama, and D�waruci (Modern Javanese versions of the Old Javanese "classics"), Mangkunagara IV's Weddhatama and Pakubuwana IV's Wulang Reh (ultrarefined didactic works composed by the two Javanese rulers to teach proper behavior in the hierarchically stratified society of the nineteenth-century court), Ronggawarsita's Kalaridha (a didactic "prophecy"), and the "encyclopedic" Centhini (the overtly Islamic context of which tends to be ignored). For a contemporary survey of the "classics" as

defined by the texts chosen for public readings in 1980s Yogyakarta, see Bernard Arps Tembang in Two Traditions, pp. 121-23.

j1 - ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAVA

This classical image today belongs to a modern discursive formation I

call "the cult of the adi/luhung." The word adiluhung translates as "the beautiful sublime." It has become in recent years the code word for what many modern Javanese appreciate as the super-refined (halus) sublime heights and profound depths of Javanese culture. The cult of the adiluhung idealizes a refined Javanese culture through the lenses of what is taken to be the culture of the traditional elite, that is, the priyayi.'* The privayi, and especially the neo-priyayi, in Java today are remarkable for their insistent preoccupation with the deep symbology they want to see underlying Javanese life. This preoccupation tends to linger on the alleged "high" arts, "traditional" rituals, linguistic etiquette, and the like. Modern devotees of the adiluhung are inclined to view "Java" as a traditional cultural unity whose true and essential center belongs to a more perfect past and behind ideally exclusive palace walls. Precisely because it is devoted to monumentalizing Central Javanese culture, the adiluhung view has little interest in analyzing the history and remarkable diversity of that culture.

The beginnings of this modern cult may be found in early-rwentiethcentury Indies theosophical circles, where conservative privayi worked together with sympathetic Dutch Javanologists toward a spiritualized codification of elite culture."" A particularly well known product of this movement is the explication of the "true inner meaning" of the wayang (shadow puppet theater) published in Dutch by the Javanese prince Mangkunagara VII in 1933. It was this same Dutch-educated prince, inciden58. The word privayi, originally from para yayi ("the younger siblings" [of the king]) came to mean the administrative and/or bureaucratic elite of the realm (kingdom and colonial state); in contemporary Indonesia, priyayi names the postcolonial Javanese elite. On the formations of privayi culture, see Heather Sutherland, The Making of a Bureaucratic Elite.

59. This "movement" became active at precisely the same time (and in reaction to?) the immensely popular nationalist Sarekat Islam movement. Interestingly, the theosophical codification of elite culture tends to disregard or elide Islam from its considerations

of essential "Java." 60. K.G.P.A.A. Mangkunagara VII, "Over de wajang-koelit (poerwa) in het algemeen

This early-twentieth-century move toward the construction of tradition has been repeated and intensified under the aegis of Soeharto's self-proclaimed New Order government. Perhaps reacting against a differently constructed relationship with the past enjoyed in the radically populist Revolutionary and Sukarno eras, New Order adiluhung rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of the late colonial voice. Highlighting what is imagined as the super-refined and spiritualized ways of traditional priyayi and then contrasting them with those of the so-called coarse and material West, the New Order Javanese elite have invented a vision of their very own adituhung heritage as the somewhat endangered pinnacle of cultural development, the preservation (and reservation) of which they see as a "sacred duty.""

Within the cult of the adiluhung, the material texts of "Traditional Javanese Literature" in royal manuscript are perhaps the reigning icon of high culture." Like the romantic colonial vision, the modern adiluhung view imagines that it was in the ultra-rarified world of nineteenth-century royal courts that Javanese writing attained the perfection of its literary expression-a perfection which can never again be achieved." Among today's Javanese, it is widely believed that the language in which these royal manuscripts are inscribed is a kind of super-krama or super highJavanese, Javanese language pushed to the limits of halus-ness. Indeed it is

sometimes thought that the language of these texts has attained a degree of refinement which situates it beyond the limits of comprehension. A commonplace assertion among modern Javanese is that "the language of this literature is so sublime that we couldn't possibly understand it." And

yet there remains a general consensus as to what that same unintelligible writing is about. The literature, it is said by the same people who are invested in its incomprehensibility, promises nothing less than the keys to life's deepest mysteries. However, since the literature is assumed unintelligible, those mysteries needs must remain forever shrouded. To support their assertions, many Javanese can sing from memory a line or two from one of the more famous nineteeth-century poems, the Weddhatama ("The Noble Wisdom"). This poem, whose authorship is attributed to Mangkunagara IV (grandfather of the theosophical Mangkunagara VII),** is a highly alliterative, sometimes abstruse didactic and speculative poem. In many ways the We�ddhatama actually fulfills the dream of the adiluhung.
The poem opens:

Turning away from vain desire For the delight of teaching the young Rendered in song beautiful

Embellished wrought elegantly That perfectly practiced be the knowledge sublime [Iwhung|

Which in the land of Java is The religion of the rulers."

65. There has been some dispute over the authorship of this poem, some claiming that the true author was rather a certain R.M.Ng. Wiryakusuma, one of Mangkunagara IV's courtiers. In a fascinating document from the Mangkunagaran Archives, Tarakusuma (a descendant of Wiryakusuma) reports to Mangkunagara VII concerning the disputed authorship. This report describes Mangkunagara IV's alleged method of poetic composition. The prince had installed about the palace a number of slates upon which he would write verses when so moved, The document notes that slates were positioned on the east and west verandahs of the royal residence as well as in the royal toilet. The prince would write as he walked back and forth along the verandahs and as he relieved himself. At the end of the day the slates were collected up and surrendered to the prince. The prince would then divide up the slates among his Javanese literature students (Mangkunagara IV with the assistance of R.Ng. Jayawiyata taught Javanese letters to a group of seven students). The prince then ordered the students to transcribe the contents of their assigned slates onto paper. Next he would order each student to compile his assigned writings into some order ("dhi dawoekhi ngoeroetake panoelise").
It was to Wiryakusuma that Mangkunagara IV assigned the slates which were to become the Weddhatama (Tarakusuma, Serat Paturan ingkang sasambetan bab caranipun K.G.PA.A. Mangkunagara IV nganggit serat [Surakarta, 10 April 1941]. MS.

My English rendering of these lines fails in a number of ways as

translation, for it does not effectively re-register the modes of signification of the prince's text. Lost is the exuberant alliteration and assonance

of the original poetry ("Mingkar mingkur ing angkara . . ."); lost too is the poem's treasured inaccessibility. My translation remains far too understandable to capture the tonality of the adiluhung. That tonality was much better rendered (without translation) into another universe of meaning by the late Indonesian pop singer Gombloh about ten years ago. What Gombloh did was to lift the first four lines of this stanza and then graft them onto an even less accessible Javano-Indic mantra. Sung soulfully to a rock melody, the mysterious words compose a sense of "tradition" which then opens out into a rock song." Those who heard and repeated these lines of the Weddhatama had no expectation of ever understanding what they meant, and instead appreciated them as a mantric emblem of "Javaneseness," which is precisely what they are-not just in Gombloh's song, but in everyday popular consciousness as well.

I suggested earlier that it is in manuscript form that the texts are most highly esteemed. There are at least three reasons for this phenomenon.
First, the manuscripts are usually old and hence wear the patina of age that is among the marks of spiritually charged objects in Java. As material objects, the manuscripts are physical sites upon which the extraordinary powers of former writers and readers may have rubbed off. And so they offer the possibility of power by contagion. Second, the manuscripts are

esteemed for their rarity. Access to manuscripts in Java is reserved, if not quite as reserved as many believe."" Third, the manuscripts are esteemed

See, for example, Stuart Robson, The Wedhatama: An English Translation (Leiden: Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land-, en Volkenkunde Working Papers No. 4, 1990); Martin F.
Hatch, "Lagu, Laras Layang," pp. 258-355; and Suranto Atmosaputro and Martin Hatch, "Serat We�datama: A Translation," Indonesia 14 (October 1972):157-82.

68. Rumor among Javanese today holds that nearly all their manuscripts have been stolen by sinister outsiders, that these inscribed treasures were long ago carted off to distant caches in London and Leiden. And the small number of manuscripts believed still remaining in Java are often considered the sole preserve of the palaces-situated

for having been inscribed in Javanese script. The exaltation of this script has its own history. There are, for example, a number of nineteenthcentury writings that specifically treat the hidden meaning, and power, of Javanese script in relation to Javanese bodies."" Much more recently, and in a rather different way, Indonesia's President Soeharto rearticulated the esoteric fascination of this script for New Order Javanese. It was at the 1991 National Congress on Javanese Language that the president presented his thesis: a consideration and affirmation of the relevance of the letters of the Javanese script, that is, the alphabet, for Indonesian political and economic development. Significantly, Soeharto's speech had nothing to do with actually reading Javanese writings. Instead, he focused exclusively on the mysteries of the script as such-apart from what the script might write. Among other things, he said of his native Javanese script: "And so, if we have difficulty nowadays comprehending Javanese script, at least we can pass on the philosophy contained in that script to the nation in order that our people may come to know their essential truth, their true identity (jati diri) as it has been ordained by God."" President Soeharto's acknowledgment of the simultaneous incomprehensibility and value of this divinely ordained script invites further comment.

In contemporary Java, the exalted and mysterious status of this form of

Although it is true that a large number of manuscripts have found their ways (by a variety ouf means) to European repositories, a vast number of manuscripts remain in Java-both inside and outside the royal repositories. And the royal repositories are not as closed as imagined: with the possible exception of the Pakualaman Palace, there is scholarly access to the manuscripts of all four courts of Central Java. Moreover, as a result of several microfilm projects over the last fourteen years, microfilm copies of manuscripts from the Kraton Surakarta, the Istana Mangukunagaran, and the Kraton Yogyakarta are now available at the National Archives in Jakarta, as well as in several research libraries in the United States and Australia. In addition to the palace collection, there are important collections of Javanese manuscripts in several public museums and librames in Indonesia: for example. the Museum Radyapustaka in Surakarta, the Sono Budoyo Museum in Yogyakarta, the Perpustakaan Nasional in Jakarta, and the Fakultas Sastra Universitas Indonesia again in Jakarta. For further notes on the critical importance of these indigenously assembled collections of manuscripts, see my Javanese Literature in Surakarta Manuscripts, 1:1 1-36.

36 INTRODUCTION

writing has been nurtured in the most common scene of confrontation between present-day Javanese and Javanese script: the public school room.
As the president acknowledged, very few Javanese today are able to read

this script despite the fact that most studied it briefly in the primary grades. It is precisely this brief study, so quickly stopped, as the curriculum dictates," which endows many Javanese with a profound sense of failure (when, many years later, they remember what they have forgotten). That they tried and failed attests to what is already implied by the internal logic of the adiluhung's modern ideal of inaccessibility. Knowledge of this divinely ordained script-because this script belongs to adiluhung literature and because it alone can really write that literature-apparently cannot be

attained by study alone.
With this sense of the presumed inaccessibility of Javanese writing in

mind, I turn now to the nineteenth-century Javanese writer who emerges as the cult figure around whom the fiction of the adiluhung has crystallized. By a curious quirk of history, this figure is none other than Cohen

71. The problem of the present generation's illiteracy in Javanese script, as a direct result of the national curriculum of 1975, was among the major issues discussed at the 1991 Javancse Language Congress. At the press conference that closed the Congress, a number of resolutions were announced; among them, resolutions (1) to return serious teaching of Javanese language and script to the public schools-from primary through tertiary educational institutions, (2) to prepare textbooks of Javanese script, language, and grammar, (3) to support research on Javanese language, literature, and especially on the philosophy of the Javanese alphabet. The resolutions were based on an affirmation of the relevance for the modern Indonesian nation of the noble values contained in the philosophical meanings of the letters of the Javanese alphabet [as proclaimed by

President Socharto at the opening of the Congress] (Suara Merdeka, 21 July 1991). In April 1994 the Yogyakarta Center of Research on Traditional History and Values, a division of the Indonesian Department of Education and Culture, hosted the National Seminar on the Mcaning of the Letters of the Javanese Alphabet ("Seminar Nasional Pengkajian Makna Ha-na-ca-ra-ka"). The official invitation to the seminar explained its mission: "to uncarth the noble cultural values of the Indonesian people and to realize (merealisast) the speech that President Socharto presented on 'The Hidden Meaning of the Letters of the Javanese Alphabet' at the opening of the Congress of Javanese Language on 15 July 1991."

Javanese script illiteracy is characteristically "modern Indonesian." Prior to World War II, among the numerically few literate (in the conventional sense) Javanese, reading and writing Javanese meant reading and writing Javanese script. Literate Javanese of the period were less likely to be literate in roman script. All this changed abruptly in 1942 with the coming of the Japanese and the banning of Javanese script in print and in schools.

Stuart's maligned "native informant," R.Ng. Ronggawarsita. Clearly a voracious reader and truly a prolific writer, Ronggawarsita is said to have written as many as fifty-nine books, several among them monumental tomes thousands of pages long."" In Java today, Ronggawarsita is accorded popular recognition as the greatest of all Javanese literati. And yet most of his writings are left unread. Even Ronggawarsita's most avowed admirers have rarely read anything beyond his celebrated Kalatidha and a smattering of his short prophetic poems. His longer works remain little read, perhaps assumed to be too refined for readability, too adiluhung for

comprehension.

Although recognized as "the greatest Javanese poet," Ronggawarsita is remembered as the last, or better yet, as the seal, of the pujongga. Although pujonega may be glossed as "court poet,""> the English gloss misses pujongga's implications in Javanese. To be a pujongga in Java means (or meant, as the case may be) to be a master of language with a prophetic pen. The writing of Ronggawarsita is revered not only for its reputed refinement, but even more so for its very material power to effect realitythat is, to make things happen. As a prophetic pujongga, Ronggawarsita quite literally wrote history, before and after the fact. If then one could really read his writing (which, of course, one cannot since it is situated at an ideal point beyond legibility), then one would really know the world in its past, present, and future.

Interior to the modern logic of the sublime adi/uhung and its pujonggaship, however, is the ultimate inaccessibility of both. It is out of the realm of conceivable possibility to learn how to become a pujongga or, for that

722. See Simuh, Mistik Islam Kesawen Raden Ngabehi Ranggawarsita (Jakarta: University of Indonesia Press, 1988), pp. 51-52.

73. Indeed, there was a spiritual-literary office of pujongga (or sometimes, bhujangga) at Javanese courts which dated from days of Majapahit and probably became reinstated with the "Surakarta Renaissance." For a retrospectively constructed listing of historical pujongega by the last Javanese to hold that office, see Ronggawarsita's Serat Salastlah, Urutipun Panjenengan Nata ing Tarah Jawi, awit Panjenengan Ratu Prabu D�ewatacengkar, Medhangkamulan (composed Surakarta [mid-19th century]; inscribed Surakarta, 1878). MS. B 84; SMP MN 245). The office has remained vacant since Ronggawarsita's death in 1873. It is widely accepted that there will never be another pujongga.
Two rationales for this absence are offered: that the puongga-ship is no longer relevant; and that no modern Javanese could ever fulfill the stringent intellectual, and especially supernatural, requirements for the position.

matter, to learn how to read the meanings of the pujongga's words."" In a

1930s biography of Ronggawarsita, the "Ronggawarsita Committee" reports how, after a singularly unsuccessful course of study at the Tegalsari pesantren in Ponorogo, the uncanny linguistic mastery of pyjongga-ship descended in a flash of divine light (wahyu) upon the young Ronggawarsita."" The youth, who had been up to that time a veritably intractable and delinquent pupil, at once knew and understood-without study!Arabic, Javanese, and Dutch language and literature."" Presumably, it would take being hit by a similar flash of light for those who came after him to approach a real reading of Ronggawarsita's writing. Countless failed encounters with Javanese script in schoolrooms routinely bring this point home to the youths of modern Java.

And so traditional Javanese writing, when viewed under the modern aspect of the adiluhung, is caught in a multiple bind. In praise of its exalted status are offered a number of reasons not only why rot to read it but why reading it is impossible. In the first place, the illegibility of script in which it is inscribed is intractable. It cannot be learned by study. Even should one by kind fate be graced with the gift of scriptural decipherment, then it is the language inscribed by that script that is too exalted to be understood.
And were that language to become understandable (through an [en|lightening strike), the would-be reader knows that what that language writes is something so profound as to be beyond discursive comprehension. And

Traditionally, however, at least one text 1 have read writes how, step by step, one can through careful and diligent study learn to "be like a puzongga in excellence" (ng�emp�ri kaluwihaning pujongga) by fulfilling eight heavy (wert) conditions of excellence ( Serat Wawaton Angger Tatakrama tuwin Adangiyah ingkang sampun kalampahaken wonten ing Karaton Tanah Jawi dalah Ada-ada Udanagara [composed Surakarta, s.a.; inscribed Surakarta, {late 19th to carly 20th century}]. MS. RP H3; SMP MN 5422, pp. 21-22).
Ronggawarsita's Wind Hidayat Jats provides an almost identical list as conditions for the teacher of tassawuf; see Simuh, p. 179.

so in contemporary Java the text of traditional literature remains on the shelf, an unread artifact of high culture, a dusty fetish.

Reading Traditional Javanese Writing Today: An Uncommon Moment

It was in this context of not-reading in contemporary Java that I decided to write a book which would suggest what actually reading the texts of traditional Javanese writing could still mean today. The real possibility of the regeneration of traditional meaning was suggested to me by an incident that occurred in 1984, when one of those books was pulled from the

shelf, opened, and (quite traditionally) read aloud. Although reading texts of traditional Javanese writing was hardly popular among the avant garde youth of Solo in the early 19805, it was then that a young art student and songwriter who went by the name B) came up with the idea of putting the melodies of traditional verse to guitar music for performance at Solo's university. He remembered the basic melodies of most of the macapat meters as well as the words to one or two standard verses he had learned to sing as a child, but needed more lyrics to fill out the performance.
Knowing that my work involved the texts of traditional literature, BJ

came to me in search of material. What his generation had been taught to expect of traditional texts-and no doubt dreaded"-was something adiluhung like the Weddhatama. What he read, that is, sang, was the following professional fantasy of an imaginary guru:

A single line in Arabic is all I need to know

Then that would I teach my pupils My students satisfied

77. In the case of BJ (that is B. J. Rianto, now a university lecturer and still a songwriter), the dread was clearly mixed with attraction. Indeed, the notion of putting macapat to guitar had been his idea after all. BJ spoke fondly and with awe of the haunting sensation the memory of his mother's voice reciting macupat at night still evoked for him. BJ's interest in the traditional texts was also sparked by memories of his late father, a well-known dhukun ("healer"; "practitioner of supernatural arts"), who some say was the son of the legendary Gusti Satriya, a magically marvelous son of Pakubuwana IX, who died (or perhaps vanished) in exile toward the close of the nineteenth century. Given his background, BJ's sense of the texts of tradition was not just the

product of New Order schools.

"Til | reeled-still I'd count it fortune fair That he hadn't brained me after all"*

The reading almost broke down, not from the text's illegibility, but from BJ's howls of laughter. Where on earth had these outrageously funny, wholly irreverent, and clearly understandable lines come from?
The verses are from Serat Jayengbaya ("The Book of Him Who Conquers Danger"), an early poem composed by Ronggawarsita, that last of the pujongga himself. This is not what BJ had been taught in school to expect from the pen of Mr. Adiluhung. Understandable without being simple, it was parodic and biting with a slapstick sense of humor.

Serat Jayengbaya is remembered fondly by the few contemporary readers of macapat texts I met who were familiar with it. I recall the glints of delight which shone in the eyes of those readers at the mere mention of the poem's title. One of them, a custodian at the Kraton Surakarta, could

sing extended passages of the poem from memory. Most likely to be cataloged under the heading of "didactic literature," Serat Jayengbaya is (among other things) a portrait of pamrih in nineteenth-century Java.
Pamrih means desire, or rather the sinister under-belly of desire-the self-interested ulterior motive. The imaginary ego of the text, a certain Jayengbaya, trying to decide just what to be in this life, moves through a series of fantasized career choices. In every imagined case, he falls from the enjoyment of pleasure's pinnacle to catastrophic ruin-often to disfigurement and death. For example, much in the idiom of a used-car dealer, Jayengbaya imagines life as a horse trader. Reveling in the good life after making a killing off of an unsuspecting aristocratic customer, Jayengbaya is then himself killed in a gory accident while taking one of his horses on a trial run. Again, our hero imagines a life of luxury as a

Dutchman's houseboy. Enjoying the master's hand-me-down clothes, as well as the charms of the Indo-European missus, the houseboy's life is truly blissful until one day when the master returns home unexpectedly.
"Caught in the act" with his master's missus, the houseboy's fate is not a pretty one. There is a rhythm to Jayengbaya's fantasized carcer moves that invites further reading. To cite just a few of the sequences: from

horse trader to performing artist to gambler to drug dealer (verses 2-41), from lawyer to thief to judge to Dutchman's houseboy (verses 56-74), from beggar to soldier to executioner to courtier (verses 176-214), and

finally from dog to God Almighty to one struck dead by lightning (verses 241-49). A provocative opening into ninetcenth-century Java both sociologically and literarily, the text energetically overturns the received images of Javanese literature and of palace literati.

And it was with this new perspective that BJ-and after him, his friends-went on to read other surprising texts of traditional Javanese writing. Attuned to the melodic curves of traditional verse, he created a range of sometimes bluesy, sometimes sweet guitar melodies for various poetic tonalities and maximum poetic effect-and perhaps, too, for cultural revenge. News spread, and one evening the host of Surabaya's tv talk show titled "Javanese Literature Appreciation" came to hear BJ sing these lines, again from Serat Jayengbaya:

But if I were a soldier to be

Every day would be great fun

And grief a thing long gone

In time I'd rise to lieutenant in rank A station of some esteem

I'd swagger and strut down the road With the air of a Major General

Who could be the likes of me?
All met would fall "plunk" to their knees

As I'd be taken for high royalty Ah! My pleasure would know no bounds

Like a dashing young wayang hero I'd be

Except that I'm not good looking And 1 have no self-control"

But I'd be trembling in my boots If ever there came the news

That real battle were about to break Fine-if I could find a way

So. In the sense of the forbearance to perform ascetic practice (tapa).

4} - ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF READING IN JAVA

To turn in my buckle and sword

But if sent to the front all 'a sudden That would surely be the end of me*"

Quite taken by what he heard, the tv host enthusiastically invited BJ to perform on his literature appreciation show, but only on the condition that something else be sung, something a bit more "traditional." Not that he didn't enjoy this "new" poetry, he explained, but it would never pass the state censorship board.� With a naughty gleam in his eye, BJ protested that this was real adiluhung stuff straight from the pen of the young Ronggawarsita. The talk-show host was silent. Youth singing tradition was fine-but the conventional image of tradition was shattered if old Ronggawarsita (tradition incarnate) was a youthful radical. The invitation was not repeated and the tv performance never materialized.

That Ronggawarsita would have entertained such a cynical view of the society around him is not really so surprising if one considers his personal history and the grievous conditions obtaining among Surakarta courtiers in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Serat Jayengbaya was probably written around 1830, toward the end of the Dipanagara Warthat is, just at the boundary which marks the disappearance from the Javanese courts of the last remnants of any real political power. After the war the courts of Central Java were impoverished, and the courtiers lived

under straitened circumstances. Ronggawarsita's own poverty is legendary." The last of the pujongga must also have borne more personal scars

81. Ronggawarsita, Serat Jayengbuya, p. 40 (verses 178-80).

82. Perhaps the tv host heard in Ronggawarsita's poetry an allusion to the military operations that were under way in East Timor at the time.

83. A sandi-asma (a literary convention whereby the author and/or copyist inscribes a "hidden" signature into the poetry) in Jayenghaya's opening stanza reads "Kiyahi Sarataka." According to the Ronggawarsita Committee's biography, the poet-born Bagus Burham in 1802, to become Mas Rongga Pajanganom in 1819 upon his initial appointment as "Carik Kadipaten Anom" at the Kraton Surakarta-was granted the name Mas Ngab�hi Sarataka by H.R.H. Pakubuwana V in Jimawal 1749 (1821-22) at the time of his promotion to the position of "Mantri Camk Kadipaten Anom." In Jimawal 1757 (1829-30) his name was changed to K.Ng. Ronggawarsita when he was promoted (by Pakubuwana VII?) to the rank of "Pan�wu Carik Kadipaten Anom." See Babad Cariyos Lelampahanipun Suwargi Raden Ngabe�h: Ronggawarsita, 2:84 85 and 102-3. Since there are allusions in Jayenghaya to events occurring in 1828 (see below), the poem must have been written sometime in the years 1828-30.

from that war. In 1830 he lost his king to exile and saw the kingdom he served reduced to near total colonial submission. Closer to home, in 1828

the poet's father, the elder Ronggawarsita (reputedly a brilliant literatus,

whose works have been entirely suppressed), was arrested for his antiDutch intrigues and exiled to Batavia, where he died. The arrest was carried out personally by the Dutch Resident of Surakarta with the able help of his Indo-European translator, C. F. Winter Sr., author of the Javaansche Zamenspraken mentioned above.�" The captured elder Ronggawarsita had been one of Winter's Javanese teachers." This, of course, calls to mind the younger Ronggawarsita's position later as "native informant" (read teacher) to Cohen Stuart-to say nothing of the services the younger Ronggawarsita provided Winter himself for the three decades following Winter's betrayal of his father. The father's arrest and exile may very well be written into the Jayerigbaya, in the section on the

teacher of invulnerability:

But then some fateful day

When gathered together in secrecy Discussing strange matters of mystery Without warning a thunder of feet

And the blaze of the Resident's parasol"

use of torture tn extract the elder Ronggawarsita's confession. Likely arrested and exiled along with the elder Ronggawarsita was Mas Ronggasmita, whom I invoked at

the beginning of this book [see note 2 above).

In the introduction to his 1846 translation of a Modern Javanese work into archaized Kawi, Winter gratefully acknowledges his teachers: Sastranagara |= Yasadipura [1], the elder Ronggawarsita II [whom he had betrayed] and [the last of the pujongga) Ronggawarsita III; see Leiden Oriental (LOr)}, codex 2141.

Thus wrote the palace pujongga, son of an exiled subversive, and sadly loyal, paid native informant to the local Dutch philologists.

Even a cursory reading of Ronggawarsita's Serat Jayengbaya counters both modern images of "Traditional Javanese Literature." Literature imaged as merely f�odal, as over-refined oozings from the reactionary courts of a decadent ruling class, has no room for a text so cynical, so biting in its satire. And the understandable, humorous language of the poem points to a literature quite different from that imagined as icon of the adiluhung.
One of the features of this text which invites a vision of nineteenthcentury Java not quite in accord with the received wisdom is the striking juxtaposition of images that do not seem to belong together, a literary device employed in this poem with parodic and comic effect. At one point in the poem, the pleasure at being touched by the flick of a prostitute's scarf is likened to the feelings enjoyed when promoted at court."" Yet another jarring image is of the moment of glory fantasized for the kaum, a professional chanter of Islamic prayers: when hired to pray at a priyayi's funeral, he seizes the lucky opportunity to stuff some cups and saucers under his shirt."

Always a vagrant of the imagination, the antihero Jayengbaya (however high the fantasized position) seems incapable of conjuring an image of himself as anything other than marginal.

My children and my grandchildren That I was to be by lightning seized

So there my corpse would lie For days before discovered Unknown, consumed by maggots

And so I'd really rather not Be by lightning struck

91. Ki Ageng S�la was a sixteenth-century ancestor of the Mataram dynasty (grandfather of Ki Ageng Mataram). A farmer from the northern Central Javanese village of Sela, he is noted for having captured a bolt of lightning. He transported that lightning bolt, which had taken on the form of an old man, to the Kraton of Demak, where it /he was imprisoned. The lightning bolt was eventually saved by an old woman (the lightning's wife). By Kraton Surakarta tradition, the tree to which the lightning bolt had been chained was transplanted from palace to palace as the Kratun of Java moved (i.e., Demak to Karta to Pl�red to Kartasura to Surakarta) and now still grows in the Srimanganti Lor courtyard of the Surakarta Palace, just to the southeast of the northern Mandhungan portal.

Thought" (Language and Power, p. 259).

Would it not be better then Though but tatters in the wind: to live"

Seemingly a perpetual loser, Jayengbaya's name translates as "He-whoconquers-danger." And finally at poem's end, our antihero wins. In the wake of the naked exposure of the falseness of his Surakartan society, Jayengbaya finally conquers danger by rejecting all the available options: first the God option when God turns out to be numbered among the homeless, and then the death option-thereby saving his neck. The momentary pleasure enjoyed at the fantasy of a quick and painless exit from the scene (by the good services of the lightning bolt) is quickly displaced by anxiety over the imagined silencing of his voice, and his consequent (future) absence from the memories of his children and grandchildren.
That anxiety expresses itself in the ghastly image of maggots swarming over Jayengbaya's unburied corpse. But our hero, having rejected his present in poetic joke, chooses, with similar irony, "to live"-a life that is nothing more than tatters in the wind. And so the poet concludes his 250stanza work:

Cast adrift by life's desires

Jayengbaya's writing

Amidst works' foul madness

Becomes but day-long darkness Blissfully doing what can(not) be done* Holy words evilly expressed

Two hundred fifty verses are enough."

It must be emphasized that Ronggawarsita's Jayengbaya is not the only alternative textual opening into nineteenth-century Javanese literary and sociological worlds. Rather it is part of a larger body of contestatory writing that has been for the most part ignored. Another text which comes immediately to my mind is the early-nineteenth-century Serat Mas Nganten."* Composed by a high noble of the Surakarta court, this

poem is a comical satire on court etiquette in the hands of the nouveaux riches. Again, the cheeky humor of the later-nineteenth-century Suluk

Gatholoco is a product of (among other things) angry plays on the formal constraints of traditional poetics and conventional morality.* Actually Suluk Gatholoco is but one of many spirited suluk, the so-called "Islamic mystical songs." Indeed, the suluk texts comprise a huge chunk

of nineteenth-century writing characteristically overlooked by the devotees of the adiluhung." It is of note here that, aside from historical

texts (babad literature), the suluk comprise the single largest grouping of texts in the library of Surakarta Palace. In fact, that supposed bastion of conservatism and original Javanism has but a small smattering of the

"belletristic Indic classics" and their translations." Of the historical texts, the sometimes hilarious descriptions of royal dalliance in the often monotonous court chronicles of the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century are written with a kind of deadpan tonality that invites critical readings of what was, by that time, starting to become Tradition with a capital T."� And a whole range of historical poems written in the nineHierarchies: Javanese Merchants and the Priyayi Elite in Solo, Central Java," Indonesia 52 (October 1991):55-83.

Of the 1,450 titles in the Kraton's manuscript collection there are only seventeen of these renowned "Surakarta Renaissance" renderings of the Old Kawi classics into Modern Javanese verse. These texts compnse about 1 percent of the collection. In contrast to these sixteen, there are nearly five hundred titles belonging to varieties of Islamic literature (including a large number of suluk texts) -that is a solid third of the entire collection.

On Reading Babad Jaka Tingkir

The remainder of this book is an extended reading of one of those imaginative historical poems, Babad Jaka Tingkir (The History of Jaka Tingkir).
In the course of this reading, it will become apparent that this history, a work composed to interrupt and contest the dominant dynastic historical tradition, was inscribed as a certain kind of prophecy. For the anonymous Javanese subject who wrote Tingkir inscribed with it a novel vision of Java's distant past in order to reflect, strategically, upon another yet-tobe-unfolded Javanese future.

The prophetic Babad Jaka Tingkir, not unlike the parodic Jayengbaya, calls into question the center/periphery dichotomy that tends to structure conventional understandings of the Javanese past. Jayengbaya effectively blurs the distinctions between the worlds of margin and center in a biting social critique of its contemporary Surakarta by moving back and forth from the worlds of entertainers, prostitutes, thieves, madmen, and beggars to those of courtiers, bureaucrats, businessmen, and educators.
With a different, perhaps more guarded form of social critique, Babad Jaka Tingkir points toward the dissolution of the centrality of centers. Writing against the grain of hegemonic dynastic history, Tingkir inscribes moments of marginality, opposition, and exile from an imagined past into a stage upon which an alternative future just might be played out. If Jayengbaya ("He Who Conquers Danger") is a parodic reading of a present, Babad Jaka Tingkir ("History of the Youth from Tingkir") is a prophetic rereading of a past.

This book, then, attempts to take seriously this prophetic rereading of the Javanese past and does so by reading it yet again. For with this book, I would write-in dialogue with this nineteenth-century Javanese writing of history-an alternative future for the Javanese past. I would thus suggest how actively reading the texts of tradition is one way to

refuse compliance with the authority of what has come in late-twentiethcentury Indonesia to be accepted as the codified meanings of the past.
Such reading has the potential to transform these curiously neglected

texts-these laid-by works-into contexts for change. To read the texts means to "dare to try to comprehend" them, that is, actively to work through possibilities with them, possibilities that call into question an adiluhung aesthetics that suppresses historical sense. To do this is also to challenge the dominant assumptions of historiography. Reading the texts of tradition just might mean, then, looking forward to a kind of writing (somewhat akin to the writing of a Javanese pujongga) that could inscribe a very different future for Javanese history.

CHAPTER 1 THE WRITING OF A HISTORY

The writing of any history takes place in history and is itself, then, a kind of historical event. Traditional Javanese historical writing, I would argue, is a practice more self-consciously aware of this truism than is the practice of writing history in the post-Enlightenment West. The post-Enlightenment historical project is conventionally understood as the objective representation of past events as framed and explained by the historical contexts in which those events are construed to have "really" occurred. Such a historical project is premised on the assumed absolute alterity of a positively dead past, a past which is there to be known and faithfully reconstructed in

writing by "objective scientists" who themselves exist (miraculously) in a place which itself seems outside history." Traditional Javanese historical writing appears to have been a significantly different project with a significantly different relation to the past. Recognizing the presence of living pasts in the historically becoming presents in which they wrote, the writers of traditional histories in Java understood the inscription of these texts as historical events, and the texts themselves as potential contexts.
Recognizing their own historical agency, these Javanese historians could, then, self-consciously employ traditional conventions of writing to effect a transformation of tradition itself. That is, such traditional Javanese historical writing, because it was self-consciously written in and of history, was capable, at times, of rewriting the conditions of its own production.
What, then, do we know of the history of the writing of Babad Jaka Tingkir? What kind of historical event does its inscription compose? How is the text of Tingkir situated as a writing of history? What manner of

1. See Michel de Certeau, The Writing of History (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988), pp. 1-6.

historical agent actually wrote this remarkably untypical traditional text?
In this chapter, we will turn to the actual manuscript of Babad Jaka Tingkir to begin to address these questions.

In original manuscript there survives but a single witness of this unique telling of a Javanese past. This surviving manuscript witness is inscribed and bound into the end of a volume that is now stored in the library of the senior palace of Surakarta. That volume, titled Kupiya Iber Warni-warni Sampéyan-dalem kaping VI ("Copies of the Miscellaneous Correspondence of His Majesty the Sixth"; hereafter: His Majesty the VI's Correspondence),* appears a diplomatic archive associated with Pakubuwana VI, the Surakarta king who vanished into exile in 1830. How, then, does Babad Jaka Tingkir, this history of a legendary hero of the sixteenth century, belong to the correspondence of an exiled nineteenth-century king? To

begin to answer this question I turn now to sketch a very brief history of that exiled king's life and times.

I.S.K.S. Pakubuwana VI

Born in 1807 to a secondary wife of Pakubuwana V, Pakubuwana VI was the ruler of the Kraton Surakarta from 1823 to 1830. He was not, apparently, a particularly popular monarch. Elevated to the throne when he was only sixteen years old, at least in part by the machinations of his foster

the portion of the original Kraton manuscript in which the babad is inscribed, a copy acquired by purchase from one Moelyono Sastronaryatmo, a Surakarta manuscript

Moelyono published a transliteration and Indonesian paraphrase of the babuad under the auspices of the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture's Project for the Publication of Indonesian and Regional Literary Works (Babad Jaka Tingkir Babad Pajang, ed.

father, the powerful Grand Vizier Sasradiningrat II (dates of office, 181246), the young king proved somewhat less tractable than his elders might

have wished. A restless figure, the king (often appearing in Dutch dress, to the dismay of his colonial "guardians") was, it seemed to his detractors, all too often on the road.> Of the king's "dressing Dutch" and his incessant travel, Lieutenant Governor General H. M. de Kock complained: "[he

frequently goes off fishing and hunting, and often dresses up as a European, and has recently had the queen dress likewise; so that it can be said of him that he is doing whatever possible to make himself unpopular. A Mohammedan despot (Mohamedaansch despoot) must, if he is to inspire honor and respect, show himself little outside his Kraton."* Apparently the restless young king-who would not conform to the Dutch ideal of the "Mohammedan despot"-was an avid reader, especially of "traditional Javanese histories"; and it seems he was an accomplished writer as well.
Of Pakubuwana VI's literary prowess, the hostile de Kock reported: "The

Emperor has little natural intellect, and yet he has picked up an extensive

knowledge of Javanese historical traditions (gebruiken); he writes fluently /smartly (viug), and he has read extensively."" Pakubuwana VI was known to perform occasionally as dhalang, or shadow-puppet master,*® and to waltz poorly."

Pakubuwana VI ascended to the throne in September 1823, shortly after his father's untimely death and the notorious canceling of land rentals in the Principalities-and a scant year and a half before Prince

Dipanagara, elder statesman of the Yogyakarta Palace (Central Java's other royal city), went into open rebellion against the encroachments of colonial domination. At the time of the outbreak of the Dipanagara War in

54 CHAPTER ONE

May 1825, Surakarta's king was barely eighteen years old. The popular Prince Dipanagara garnered a broad base of support for his rebellion: with the aid of a number of other aristocrats (including some from Surakarta) and with the extremely important backing of a powerful network of rural Islamic teachers, he earned the allegiance of a large number of ordinary villagers to his cause. The Dipanagara War, which was to rage for five long years, posed a serious threat to Dutch power in Java and marked the last stand of indigenous royal power against Dutch colonial hegemony. Where did the young Pakubuwana VI stand in this struggle? Although ostensibly supporting his Dutch overlords against the rebels, Surakarta's king was known to have sympathized with, and likely to have secretly assisted, the rebellious Dipanagara."

The war ended in the spring of 1830, when the Dutch finally captured Dipanagara (in the course of ostensible negotiations) and straightway exiled him to Menado and then on to Makassar. After finishing with Dipanagara, the colonial authorities turned to settle with their putative ally, Pakubuwana VI. The victorious Dutch shocked their shifty comrade

in arms by annexing all the outer districts (mancanagara) of both the

Surakarta and Yogyakarta courts. This act provoked the young Pakubuwana to action; he protested the annexation by withdrawing secretly to

the tombs of his ancestors and to the magical embrace of his spiritual consort. Almost certainly preparing for armed rebellion, the twentythree-year-old Pakubuwana VI was arrested in June 1830 on Java's south8. Pakubuwana VI was long suspected of disloyalty to the Dutch colonial government.

ern coast where he was communing with the spirit Queen of the South

Sea." The young king was deposed and exiled to the remote island of Ambon, located across a great expanse of ocean some 1,200 miles to the east of Central Java. Joining the young ex-king in exile were his favorite wife, Ratu Anom, one of his young daughters, and a tiny handful of faithful retainers.

With the exile of Pakubuwana VI and the ascension to the throne of his

Dutch-favored uncle, Prince Purbaya, as Pakubuwana VII (r. 1830-58), whatever vestiges of political power the Surakarta rulers had managed to retain were finally lost. But at war's end, it was not just the ruling elite who suffered: five years' warfare had brought devastating losses to the people of Central Java. At a time when the population of the entire island of Java numbered but seven million souls, the war had claimed well over 200,000 Javanese lives; Yogyakarta's population was reduced by half."" After the war the Javanese peasantry, under the notorious Cultuur Stelsel, would be pressed into the forced cultivation of export crops, the profits of

whose sale would go into the Dutch colonial treasury. The year 1830 is, then, a watershed year in Javanese history, marking the final end of indigenous royal political power, the defeat of the last serious military challenge to Dutch authority on the island (prior to the Indonesian national revolution), and the beginning of high colonialism in Java." Pakubuwana VI was never allowed to return to Surakarta; he died in

exile in 1849 at the age of forty-two." His remains were not returned to

56 CHAPTER ONE

Java until 1957-after the Indonesian Republic had won its independence from the Dutch. In December 1830, six months after his arrest, a son was born to the exiled king by one of the queens he had left behind in Surakarta. That son, who was never to see his father, eventually succeeded to the throne of the Kraton as Pakubuwana IX (r. 1861-93). Over a century after his death, Pakubuwana VI was proclaimed a "Hero of Indonesian

National Independence" by presidential decree in 1964.

Babad Jaka Tingkir, item number sixty-three of the sixty-three items composing His Majesty the VI's Correspondence, somehow belongs to the documentary archive of this Hero of Indonesian National Independence.
What manner of royal correspondence is compiled in this volume? In

addition to the Tingkir history, the volume comprises a collection of letters and treaties (dated 1812-48) that appear to have been copied from documents in the Kraton Surakarta archives, the genealogy of a certain Sarifi Ibrahim Madyakusuma, two pages of captioned pen and ink drawings, and a single page noting that "this is a commemoration of His Majesty's dream . . ." This chapter explores historically the nature of this

volume of "His Majesty the VI's Correspondence [or dream]."

The Manuscript

His Majesty the VI's Correspondence in manuscript measures 34.5 X 22 cm. and numbers some 304 pages (152 leaves, double-page numbered).
A single hand, aside from a few duly noted exceptions, inscribes the entire manuscript. That hand writes in a cursive style that was prevalent in and around Surakarta around the middle of the nineteenth century. The

hand appears to have been a fluent and practiced one (figure 4). The

Sinuhun Kangeng Susuhunan Pakubuwana VI," 3 October 1971). According to a

Kraton babad, the exiled king's death was the result of an illness brought on from a horse-cart accident in February 1849 (Serat Babat Sampéyan-dalem ingkang Sinuhun

Kangeng Susuhunan Pakubuwana kaping VI: Sri Naluri [composed Surakarta, 1906; inscribed Surakarta, ca. 1906]. MS. SP 177 Ca; SMP KS 80, pp. 220-21). Day cites a letter from Raden Ayu Timur, the king's daughter who followed him in exile, to his brother K.P.H. Natadiningrat, attributing the death to a "lung infection" ("Meanings of Change," p. 156, note 101).

§7 THE WRITING OF a HISTORY

original text is preceded by a five-page table of contents inscribed in a different (likely later nineteenth-century) hand. The spelling and punctuation of the manuscript are consistent with nineteenth-century Surakarta conventions.'* The manuscript is inscribed upon relatively lightweight European paper. There is no watermark. The leaves are brittle, and some are torn. Relatively mild ink bleed-through has perforated a number of the leaves.

The manuscript's binding is distinctive: the boards are covered with plain white cloth; the spine, with red velvet. The bound volume thus evokes the red and white gula-kelapa (sugar-coconut) motif of the royal flags of Java." This use of the gula-kelapa motif in book binding is rare. In all the Surakarta repositories, I found only one other manuscript thus bound.'* That other manuscript, also housed in the Kraton Surakarta

library, resembles His Majesty the VI's Correspondence in other ways as

well. The scripts and the papers of both manuscripts, though not identical, are remarkably similar. And, as it turns out, this other gula-kelapa

manuscript is also associated with the exiled Pakubuwana VI. Inscribed on its cover is the title: Serat Rama: Tilaran-dalem Sampéyan-dalem 1.S.K.S.

Pakubuwana kaping VI ("The Book of Rama: Legacy of H.R.H. Pakubuwana VI"). The manuscript is a copy of Yasadipura's late-eighteenthcentury macapat Serat Rama, which-though written in a Surakarta script, and stored in the library of the Surakarta Palace-was produced on the island of Ambon. The copy was commissioned by the exiled Pakubuwana VI in May 1846," some three years prior to his June 1849 death.

14. See figures 4-5 for reproductions of MS. pp. 39verso and 152 recto, the first and last pages respectively of Babad Jaka Tingkir.

15. According to Kraton Surakarta sources, the gula-kelapa flag motif dates from the kingdom of Majapahit and symbolizes the fertile union of male (white) and female (red) principles. In modern times, this motif has been taken over by the national flag of Indonesia: Sang Merah Putih.

Were, then, both these gula-kelapa volumes produced in Ambon for the exiled Pakubuwana VI and then, following his death, brought home to Surakarta by one of the wives, children, or retainers who, having shared his exile, were repatriated to Java in June 18502

The Compilation

His Majesty the VI's Correspondence comprises some sixty-three textual items, the sixty-third and longest of which is Babad Jaka Tingkir'* Of the remaining sixty-two textual items, sixty-one comprise copies of Javanese language correspondence and archival documents, the overwhelming majority of which relate directly to the royal family and affairs of the Kraton Surakarta. Most of the documents (forty-five) originate from that court. The original documents date from 1812 to 1848, with a preponderance dating from 1823 to 1830, Pakubuwana VI's regnal years. The documents are not, however, copied into the volume in any strict chronological order. Seventeen of the volume's documents (fifteen of these at the close of the compilation) pertain directly to Pakubuwana VI's exile to Ambon. As I noted above, upon first reading, the copies appear to have

been made from original documents that would have belonged to the Kraton Surakarta archives. A more careful examination of these documents, however, proves a very different source was consulted by the compiler of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence.

Royal correspondence constitutes the single largest category of documents copied. Included in this category is correspondence of Pakubuwana IV (r. 1788-1820), Pakubuwana V (r. 1820-23), Pakubuwana VI (r. 182 330; d. Ambon, 1849), and Pakubuwana VII (r. 1830-58). The greater part of this correspondence comprises letters from these kings to colonial officials, Sultans of Yogyakarta, and members of the Surakarta nobility. The tone and content of the letters is formal and official, with the notable exception of the sometimes deeply personal Surakarta- Ambon correspondence of exile at the end of the collection.

60 CHAPTER ONE

royal letters are composed in macapat verse, three of them by Pakubuwana VI, one by the daughter who had followed him into exile (Gusti Raden Ayu Timur), one by his son (the future Pakubuwana IX), and one

by his brother.

In addition to the correspondence of these kings and their families, the compilation contains several letters that concern land administration and finance in the Surakarta region. Most of these letters were addressed to colonial officials from various ranks of Surakarta royalty and court retainers. There is a single missive from a senior Surakarta prince to a colonial official cum scholar of Javanese letters.

The volume opens with a complete copy of the famous and rather lengthy treaty of 1812 between the ruler of the Kraton Surakarta and the British colonial government. This treaty, which Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles secured by threat of force, seriously compromised the royal power of Surakarta kings-notably removing from them their military troops, their control of tolls and markets, their rights to move their kraton, and a goodly amount of land. When the Dutch regained control over Java in 1816, their first order of business in Surakarta was to ratify this important legal agreement.*" For it was this British treaty of 1812 that was to lay the foundations for the nineteenth-century colonial relationship the Dutch overlords would enjoy with their royal Surakarta vassals. Also copied into this volume are a report submitted by Prince Mangkunagara to the colonial Resident of Surakarta on a (putative) death-bed wish of Pakubuwana IV and copies of Pakubuwana V's accession treaties. Several documents pertain to matters of concern to the Kraton Surakarta during the Dipanagara War.

Another Compilation and Its Copy

In the course of my eight years' research in Java, I had occasion to examine a number of compilations of Javanese language correspondence and archival materials. Most of the compilations 1 reviewed were in manuscript form. One, however, was a published text. That volume, which I found at the Mangkunagaran Palace on the shelf of Surakarta's other

royal library, was first published in the Netherlands in 1845. The book was T. Roorda's Javaansche brieven, berigten, verslagen, verzoekschriften, proclamaties, publicaties, contracten, schuldbekentenissen, quitanties, processtukken, pachtbrieven en andere soortgelijke stukken; naar handschriften uitgegeven ("Javanese letters, notices, reports, petitions, proclamations, publications, contracts, 10us, receipts, legal documents, leases and other such documents; published from manuscripts"; later, and hereafter, known as the Brievenboek)."' This publication, comprising a collection of 233 Javanese language documents dated from 1812 to 1843, was produced as a textbook for the Javanese language education of Dutch civil servants bound for the Indies. Roorda opens his preface to the compilation:

It should be unnecessary to waste many words to point out the obvious utility and importance of this collection to any student of Javanese language, institutions, and customary practices-but most especially to him whose study of them is in preparation to become an official in the colonial possessions of the Government of the Netherlands East Indies.?"

How did Roorda, who was himself never to set foot in Java, acquire the documents (most of which were from Surakarta) published in the Brievenboek? Comfortably positioned on his professor's chair in the Netherlands, Roorda relied on colonial officials "in the field" for his materials. In the same preface, he goes on to acknowledge the three individuals who provided the majority of the 233 indigenous documents he had compiled for publication. The generous individuals named by Roorda were Baron Nahuys van Burgst (Resident of Surakarta 1820-22 and 1827-30), J. F. C.
Gericke (scholar of Javanese letters, Bible translator, and first director of the Surakarta Institute of Javanese Language), and C. F. Winter Sr. (liter atus, scholar of Javanese letters, official translator for the Surakarta Residency, and second director of the above-mentioned Institute).

I first examined the Brievenboek some time after my first encounter with His Majesty the VI's Correspondence at the Kraton, and I found the Dutch publication's sometimes seemingly obscure contents uncannily familiar. After some reflection, I returned to the Kraton archive for an21. T.

22. Ibid., p. i.

62 CHAPTER ONE

other look at His Majesty the VI's Correspondence-this time with a copy of the Brievenboek in hand. A careful comparison of the two volumes demonstrated that the first forty-seven documents copied into the Kraton Surakarta manuscript are identical to documents dispersed through the

233-item published Dutch volume." The first nine documents of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence both match and follow in sequence nine

of the first eleven Brievenboek documents.
Which, then, of these two texts-one a product of a Dutch publishing house, the other a manuscript of the palace archive-is the more original;

which, the more derivative? As it turns out, priority must be afforded the Dutch published textbook. The forty-seven matching documents in the Dutch publication could not have been copied from the Kraton manuscript: for, as I shall demonstrate below, His Majesty the VI's Correspondence was inscribed a good three or four years after the publication of the Brievenboek. Nor could both compilations have shared a third common Kraton archival source. We can know this with some certainty because there are among those forty-seven matching documents several which would not, it seems, have been housed in the Kraton archives. Take for example MS item no. 31 (Brievenboek 186), a letter from Prince Ngabéhi [(a Surakarta prince who did not reside in the Kraton) to Mr. Gericke in 1834, answering the latter's inquiry on a point of court language use.
Again there is MS item no. 35 (Brievenboek 219), in which two Surakarta nobles report to Mr. Winter in 1842 on the firing of a rural administrator.

It is, then, almost without a doubt that it was from an exemplar of the published Brievenboek, which had made its way to the Indies, that the

editor-scribe of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence selected out and copied the forty-seven matching documents.

On what grounds did the Javanese scribe make his or her selections?
The Brievenboek comprises some 233 documents, of which only fortyseven correspond to documents in His Majesty the VI's Correspondence.

Of the 186 published documents which do not appear in the Kraton manuscript, a great many treat the Chinese population and financial relationships between the Chinese and the indigenous nobility. Another large block of documents the Brievenboek does not share with His Majesty the VI's Correspondence concern rural provincial administration. The docu23. Appendix I provides correspondences for the contents of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence and the Brievenboek.

63 THE WRITING OF A HISTORY

ments which do correspond (that is, which were selected for inclusion in the palace manuscript) are concerned primarily with the documentary history of the court, the realm, and the family of the Surakarta kings. It was these forty-seven documents that the compiler of the palace manuscript chose to adopt as the beginning of his or her documentary history of the exiled Pakubuwana VI-an edition of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence that would close with Babad Jaka Tingkir.

The Correspondence of Exile

Following these initial forty-seven items of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence are sixteen additional documents-none of which is to be found in the Brievenboek, and all save one of which are concerned with exile.
These documents comprise fourteen royal letters that belong to the exile of Pakubuwana VI, the genealogy of an obscure Javano-Arabic character, and (finally and extensively) Babad Jaka Tingkir.

The fourteen letters are significantly different from the preceding correspondence copied from the Brievenboek. The focus of all fourteen is exile itself. The tonality of these letters tends to be less official than that of the preceding forty-seven documents. And these letters tend to convey more personal information than do the copied Brievenboek documents.
Six of these letters date from the beginning of the deposed king's exile in 1830; their contents convey the poignancy and helplessness of the situation in which the incarcerated and newly deposed king found himself. On 11 June 1830, three days after Pakubuwana VI's arrest, the king's "old friend" Resident Nahuys writes that he "has no time" to visit the king in his prison (item 48). In a letter dated 1 July, one of Pakubuwana VI's uncles describes to the prisoner-king the 14 June coronation of his rival as Pakubuwana VII (item 53). In a farewell letter dated November 1830, the new Pakubuwana VII coldly informs Pakubuwana VI that his entreaty to serve his exile on Java instead of Ambon has been refused. The new Pakubuwana goes on to report that not one of the wives or retainers the prisoner had left behind in the Kraton will agree to join him in exile-and, the usurper adds, they do not even offer proper excuses. Pakubuwana VI's requests to his successor-that he be granted custody of his young daughters, that personal items of jewelry and clothing, as well as his diaries, be sent along to him-are all refused (items 49-50).

The remaining eight documents date from 1847 and 1848, a period

64 CHAPTER ONE

shortly after the 1845 publication of the Brievenboek and just preceding the king's June 1849 death. As noted above, the tone of some of these later

letters is deeply personal; six of the final eight are composed in macapat verse. In a tearful letter to the prisoner-king that is dated October 1847

(item 57), a brother of Pakubuwana VI writes to acknowledge receipt in Surakarta of the king's letter and gifts: among these gifts had been four of the exiled king's teeth. Answering that letter in June 1848 (item 58), Pakubuwana VI, referring to himself as "I.S.K.S. [H.R.H.] Sayiddi Maolana Mokahamat Salim," describes how very desperate his circumstances have become: writing in a rude hut in the middle of the dry fields that he keeps, the forty-one-year-old ex-king says that he feels very old, "like a sun about to set." In the same posting, Pakubuwana VI sends a tender love letter (item 59) to one of the queens he left behind in Surakarta, along with the gift of sarong that he has worn-that she may use it as her pillow.
To another of his queens the ex-king writes on 27 July 1848 that "it is as though I am no longer of this world, that I am no longer at home in this world-my life hopeless, it were better that I die." He commends to her care their son (the future Pakubuwana IX) and advises her concerning her Islamic religious education. And in a postscript he records the loss of yet another tooth (item 60). The final letter (item 62) is from Pakubuwana VI's daughter Gusti Timur (the one who followed him into exile) to her younger half-brother, Prince Prabuwijaya (the future Pakubuwana IX).
Writing, on 4 June 1848, with grace and some lyric beauty of her sacred duty to remain an exile with her father, the princess grants her little brother permission to precede her in marriage.

Interposed between the final two of these letters is a document that is apparently not concerned with exile: the macapat verse genealogy of a certain Sarifi [Sharif] Ibrahim Madyakusuma (item 61).** He is called, in Arabic, "al-fakuru illallahu / ghanniyul kammid" ("this poor man of Allah, rich with praise for Allah"), a title appropriate for one who has embarked upon the Sufi way. His name indicates his nobility (a Sharif is a descendant of the Prophet Mohammad) and points toward his mixed ethnicity: Ibrahim is Arabic and Madyakusuma is Javanese. The genealogy records a distinguished lineage for Sarif Ibrahim Madyakusuma, tracing his ancestry back through twenty-nine generations of Sharifs, then through the first seven of the twelve Shi'ite Imams, to the Prophet

Muhammad, and then continuing on until finally reaching back to Adam

himself(!)."" Who was this man? Could he have been a teacher or a companion in exile of the unfortunate Pakubuwana V1?

On the Dating Provenance, and Authorship of Babad Jaka Tingkir

Let us now turn once again to the final document inscribed in this volume of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence: that is, Babad Jaka Tingkir. By far the longest of the manuscript's sixty-three documents, this anonymous history fills the final 143 of the manuscript's 304 pages. Markedly different from the rest of the royal correspondence, this extended piece of writing is a unique historical poem which offers glimpses of Java's past around the turn of the sixteenth century-the initial period of Java's conversion to Islam. The text of this history is, apparently, incomplete.
An extended fragment, this Babad Jaka Tingkir ceases abruptly mid-line

and mid-page on the final inscribed leaf of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence (figure 5).
When and where might this history have been written? And who,

perchance, was its writer? Internally the poem dates its own writing with uncharacteristic hyperbole by no less than four time-reckoning systems:

Javanese solar, Javanese lunar (a).), Hijrah (a.n.), and Gregorian (a.D.).

It was Sunday when this writing of history began

25. This pedigree would make Ibrahim Madyakusuma a distant relative of the Mataram kings. Royal Surakarta genealogies trace the right-hand descent of the dynasty

from Adam through the Prophet Mohammad and then on through the first five of the twelve Shi'ite Imams ((Ki Padmasusastra) and R.Ng. Wirapratama, Serat Sajarch

Ageng ing Karaton Surakarta [MS. RP B 77; SMP MN 690], pp. 1-18).

(Babad Jaka Tingkir 1:2-3).**

Each of the multiple dates, in accord with convention, is rendered not in numerals, but in sangkala (chronograms). Sangkala are aphoristic phrases, the words of which when read backwards signify-by a logical system of conventions-different numerical values.?" To provide dates in sangkala indicates commemoration in time (in addition and contrast to mere temporal documentation). Sangkala work to make time into significant time.
In the first place, calling attention to themselves as meaningful codes which have to be read (doubly for the discursive significance they might contain and for their numerical value), sangkala provide for the documented event a context in meaningful time. It is because sangkala name a

certain kind of time that significant events are dated by them. To date any event by sangkala is to call it significant-both to inscribe it as worthy of

remembrance and to commemorate it. This procedure for writing's selfinscription / self-commemoration in time is not at all uncommon for tradi26. The Javanese text, in Dhangdhanggula meter reads as follows: "Ing ri Akhad duk wiwit mengeti / kaping kalihlikur sasi Safar / wanci pukul sawalasé / lintang ingkang lumaku / nuju sangat lintang Mustari / pareng warsa Jimawal / Sancayaning windu / lek Jawi Mongsa Katiga / ping nembelas sangkala sang mahamuni [7] / anata [5] goraning [7] rat [1] // Héjrah Nabi tarehnya marengi / sinengkalan pandhita [7] aguna [3] / sinembah [2] ing jagad [1] kabeh / lék Walandi Agustus / kaping tigalikur winarni / sangkala trus [9] sinembah [2] / sariraning [8] ratu [1]."

27. For instance, words associated with eyes or arms (which are two) mean "two." Sembah, the gesture of reverence, indicates "two" because one offers it with his or her two hands. Words associated with fire mean "three" since guna ("fire" or "ability"), in Sanskrit, also means "three." Words associated with holes or openings indicate "nine" because of the nine openings of the (male) body. For a more comprehensive English language introduction to Javanese chronograms, see M. C. Ricklefs, Modern Javanese Historical Tradition: A Study of an Original Kartasura Chronicle and Related Materials (London: soas, University of London, 1978), p. 239 ff. The best explication of the sangkala dating system is still R. Bratakésawa's Katrangan Tjandrasangkala (Jakarta: Balai Pustaka, 1952).

68 CHAPTER ONE

tional Javanese poetic texts (including more typical historical texts, or babad). Nonetheless, by dating its writing four times over, Babad Jaka Tingkir overplays the conventional sangkala in a way that significantly intensifies its commemorative effect.

The redundant dating produces other effects as well: such a superfluity of systems all grinding together to commemorate a single moment (that is, 11:00 a. M., Sunday, 23 August 1829) lends an almost scientific sense of authority to the truth of this dating. However, this seeming precisionand, too, its truth-is contested by contradictions among the dates of these several systems. The Javanese lunar date of 22 Sapar Jimawal 1757 a J. fell in the eight-year turn (windu) of Sangara, not Sancaya, and in the Hijrah year of 1245, not 1237. The date 22 Safar 1237 a.n. was 22 Sapar Jimawal 1749, windu Kunthara (and 18 November 1821 The sixteenth day of the third Javanese solar month is 9/10 September, rather than 23 August.

These several contradictions among the dates of these multiple timereckoning systems, call into question, then, what had seemed the virtually mechanical certainty of the text's writing at a unique moment in August 1829.

But there is more. The hyperbolic dating of the text opens: "It was Sunday when this writing of history began" (Ing ri Akhad duk wiwit mengeti). What would seem the immediate presence of the history's writing is already at the outset located in the past. With the little word duk, marking past time, the writer casts his or her writing out of the present, thereby distancing its inscription from the authority of authorial immediacy. I shall return to these special features which bear upon Babad Jaka Tingkir's date of composition in a moment-after a brief detour to consider the history's provenance and authorship.

The linguistic and poetic idiom of this history situate it squarely in a tradition of writing associated with the court and city of Surakarta. The style is distinctly what is now considered "Surakarta renaissance" -that

is, Surakarta writing of the late-eighteenth through the mid-nineteenth century. Even more definitively, the poem contains numerous citations,

some of them lengthy, from texts that we know were written in, or around, the Surakarta court at that time. Notably, toward the end of this

Tingkir history are extended passages, selectively quoted and strategically edited, from more mainstream texts of historical writing associated

with the royal Surakarta palaces.
The text of Babad Jaka Tingkir contains a number of court scenes that

69 THE WRITING OF A HISTORY

are ostensibly set in the palaces of the ancient kingdoms of Majapahit and Demak. The palace described, however, is always the Kraton Surakarta.
The poem incessantly maps the Surakarta palace, but it does so always elsewhere. On one occasion mapping the most interior geography of that palace, the poet provides intimate details about the Kraton's very private women's quarters (keputren), details that could not have been known to many. In the nineteenth-century Kraton Surakarta, only the king's women, their minor children, their female retainers, and the king himself had access to the keputren.

Babad Jaka Tingkir was, perhaps, composed in August 1829, apparently in Surakarta, and quite possibly at the Kraton Surakarta. We can say with some certainty that its writer knew the Kraton-including the zenanaintimately, that he or she was fully conversant with the Surakartan literary idiom, and that he or she had with him or her at least several other texts of that tradition from which he/she quoted. But could not this history have been written by someone of Surakarta who had been transported to somewhere else?

The Interpolations

Twenty-five pages into Babad Jaka Tingkir are six interpolated pages on three leaves of paper that materially rupture the text of the history." Three surfaces of those leaves boast some remarkable inscription; the other three surfaces are blank. Drawn upon the first two of these leaves (back and front surfaces, respectively) are four pen and ink drawings: the portrait of a single figure on the first leaf (figure 6), and three smaller portraits on the second (figure 7). Such drawings were extremely uncommon in Javanese manuscripts. Aside from a book of portraits of Dutch governors general stored in the Mangkunagaran library,"" this is the only example of such portraits among all the manuscripts of the three major Surakarta repositories. The third leaf is empty of writing save the following inscription: "This is a commemoration of His [or Her] Majesty's dream in the month of Mulud, in the year of Wawu, at the time of the west

monsoon, in the year 1777 [February 1849]."* Following this "dream commemoration," it appears that a single leaf has been cut from the volume.

The interpolations bear no obvious relation to the text they interrupt; they are, however, shall we say, suggestive. The interpolated pages cut mid-line into a passage that relates the reading of a letter. The letter's reader and addressee is an exiled prince, who is himself a portrait painter.

The letter the prince reads is from the jealous royal father who had banished him. The letter is interrupted by these interpolations as it writes of exile itself-more precisely at the very moment it writes of the utility of exile for the generation of future greatness."

Bearing that text in mind, let us now examine these interpolations more carefully. The first ink drawing is a portrait, in frontal pose, of an unknown bearded man, wearing robes (jubah), turban, and a large medal in the form of an eight-pointed star (figure 6). The drawing is not captioned. The unknown character is definitely of an "Arabic-Islamic" cast. Could this be a portrait of the mysterious Sarifi Ibrahim Madyakusuma?-or is it perhaps an iconographic representation of one of the exiled heroes of the Dipanagara War: the charismatic Kyai Maja or even Prince Dipanagara himself?

The portraits on the facing page are captioned; the captioning hand, however, is not the hand that writes the rest of the manuscript. The portraits are of three figures (figure 7): a central, larger figure of a handsome man in frontal pose ("Sultan Malikil Saleh Banjarmas"), flanked by two smaller male figures in profile ("Pengéran Purbaya" and "Pengéran Harya Mentaram"). The central figure, which appears to be that of a Surakarta king, wears the regal kanigara fez, and sikepan ageng blouse and jacket. On his chest is a large multipointed, diamond-studded star strongly reminiscent of the Surakarta kings' medal of office, Kangjeng Kyai Suryawisésa. The portrait is captioned "Sultan Malikil Saléh Banjarmas." The name, or title, is Arabic and would translate, "Sultan Pious

February 1849.

Ruler [of] Banjarmas." To my knowledge there was never a Banjarmasin Sultan by that name. There were, however, two nineteenth-century Surakarta kings whose names, at different points in the courses of their very different lives, were similar to that of the mysterious Sultan Malikil Saléh

Banjarmas. Pakubuwana VII was born B.R.M.G. Malikisalikin. As we mentioned above, shortly before his death, the exiled Pakubuwana VI called himself by the Arabic name: 1.S.K.S. Sayiddi Maolana Mokhamat Salim."

Behind and slightly above the central royal figure's right shoulder, the first of the two smaller flanking figures looks out in profile, away from the central figure into the spine of the book and hence toward the turbanned figure on the facing page. This smaller figure is a somewhat sinister looking man, with narrow eyes and a face blemished by spots. The man is wearing a military jacket with gold braid at his neck and a Javanese dhesthar (head-cloth). The figure is captioned "Pengéran Purbaya." Pangéran Purbaya was the uncle, enemy, and successor of Pakubuwana VI.
Purbaya was enthroned by the Dutch as Pakubuwana VII in June 1830, as his nephew was en route to exile in Ambon. As I mentioned above, His Majesty the VI's Correspondence includes the "fairwell letters" that Pakubuwana VII sent Pakubuwana VI as the young ex-king sailed off into

exile.

Partially behind the central figure's left shoulder, the second of the two smaller figures in profile gazes with determined eyes in the direction of that central figure. Unlike the other flanking figure, this figure seems to be on the same level as the larger central figure. The figure is a strongly handsome man wearing military uniform with epaulettes and a Javanese dhesthar; the portrait is captioned "Pengéran Harya Mentaram." The elder Harya Mataram (whose name was changed to Prince Mangkubumi in 1790)" was a younger brother of Pakubuwana IV; he was, therefore, an uncle of Pakubuwana VII and grand-uncle of Pakubuwana VI. Always a rebellious figure, Mangkubumi was exiled to Ambon in 1816 for his part

in an anti-European conspiracy. In late 1825 Mangkubumi was allowed to return to Surakarta, where he died in 1826. For that brief period of repatriation, the elderly Mangkubumi lived with his son, the younger Harya Mataram." Following his father's death, that son was elevated to princely status with his late father's name. The younger Harya Mataram died K.P.H. Mangkubumi !I in 1863. He was the brother-in-law and cousin of Pangéran Purbaya (Pakubuwana VII) and generational "uncle" of Pakubuwana VI. Unlike his rebellious father, this younger Harya Mataram was evidently loyal to the Dutch overlords."

This is a commemoration of His Majesty's dream in the month of Mulud, in the year of Wawu, at the time of the west monsoon, in the

year 1777 [February 1849] (His Majesty the VI's Correspondence, p. g3recto).

The note recording that "this" is a commemoration of "His Majesty's Dream" is at the head of a page otherwise empty of inscription. Behind and below the inscription looms the ghostly impression of a Javanese king: in fact the shadow of the central royal figure on MS p. g2recto whose image appears to have migrated through the manuscript pages in order to witness this haunting commemoration (figures 8 and 9). The words that float above this royal ghost to commemorate "His Majesty's dream" are not inscribed in the captioning hand of the previous two pages, but rather in the same Surakarta cursive hand as the body of the manuscript. Which Majesty's dream, or what he dreamt, is not specified. However, the form of the dating of that unspecified dream provides a clue as to whose dream "this" commemorates, and where that dream was dreamt.

The dream is dated to the month of Mulud, in the year of Wawu 1777 (February 1849), "at the time of the west monsoon" (mangsa barat).
Reckoning time in terms of the monsoons was not common practice in

emained with Java and the rest of the outside world. Given the monsoon ating of this dream's recording, and the situation of the record in the ontext of this particular volume of royal correspondence, it may be asumed that Pakubuwana VI was the royal dreamer indicated here, and that

he dream was dreamt on Ambon. May we then presume that his shade as moved onto the page in order to lay claim to that dream ?

77 THE WRITING OF A HISTORY

"This is a commemoration of His Majesty's dream" heads a blank page shadowed by a royal ghost, a page interposed in the middle of the text of Babad Jaka Tingkir. To what does that "this" refer? What was the nature of the dream the deposed king drearnt in February 1849, a mere four months prior to his death? And what form does its commemoration take? Allow me to suggest here that, for the Javanese writer who compiled this volume of His Majesty the VI's Correspondence (almost certainly in Ambon), the soon-to-be-departed exiled king's dream of the 1849 "west monsoon" was

none other than Babad Jaka Tingkir. This book, then, is an exploration of the meaning of that dream.

Dating and Situating the Manuscript of the History

Because of the correspondence of exile preceding the text and the monsoon-dated dream which interrupts it, it is reasonable to conclude that this manuscript witness of Babaed Jaka Tingkir was inscribed on the island of Ambon, sometime between August 1848 and June 1850. The inscription of the history could not have been begun prior to August 1848: in the manuscript the Tingkir text follows the copy of a letter written by Pakubuwana VI on 27 July 1848. Twenty-five pages into the text of the history, the poem is broken by the drawings and "dream-commemoration" discussed above. I have demonstrated that this "dream-commemoration," which is dated Mulud 1777 (February 1849), was almost surely inscribed on Ambon. Following Pakubuwana VI's death on 3 June 1849, the family and retainers who had shared his exile were repatriated to Java." In June 1850, they returned to Surakarta, presumably with at least two of the late prisoner-king's manuscripts, His Majesty the VI's Correspondence and His Majesty the VI's Book of Rama, in hand.

How, then, was the manuscript produced? From his or her exile in Ambon, the Javanese writer (editor/scribe) worked from a variety of sources to compile His Majesty the VI's Correspondence. She or he had before her/himself an 1845 Dutch-published textbook compilation of

Javanese letters (perhaps the gift of a thoughtful Dutch jailer), some original Surakarta-Ambon correspondence, a genealogy, and (perhaps) the text of a unique version of the Babad Jake Tingkir. From these sources

the writer constructed his or her His Majesty the VI's Correspondence as a kind of documentary history of an exiled king.

Let us now consider further the dating and provenance of this somewhat fanciful babad which concludes a history that was "introduced" with a selection of archival documents from a Dutch textbook. In the manuscript copy produced by this presumed editor on Ambon, the babad dates itself August 1829. However, as we have seen above, contradictions among dates from the several time-reckoning systems employed by the poet problematicize the veracity of this dating. One would assume that information indicating the day's correct Hijrah year and the correct windu would have been easily accessible to a poet /scribe beginning his/her writing in Surakarta on 23 August 1829. How then might we understand the discrepancies in the dating?

The confusion in the internal dating of Babad Jaka Tingkir invites several readings. The mistake could indicate nothing more than a carelessness in chronology on the part of the poet and/or the scribe. Or perhaps the opening section of the manuscript's Surakarta prototype, which had been carried or sent off to Ambon, was damaged. Indeed, the most likely pages to be damaged or missing in Javanese manuscripts are the opening ones. Perhaps the editor on Ambon erred in his or her attempt to provide readings for illegible portions of a damaged prototype. Access to accurate Javanese time-reckoning tables in late-1840s Ambon may well have been limited. Or perhaps the confusion in the dating points toward a willful antedating of the composition of the poem. We remember how the commemoration of the commencement of the text's writing begins in past tense. Perhaps rather than scribe of the poem, the writer of this late-1840s

Ambonese compilation was instead its composer. This reading would suggest that for some reason the history's Ambonese-Javanese composer chose both to conceal his or her authorship and to push the date of the poem's composition back some twenty years to 1829-to a time preceding

Pakubuwana VI's exile. There can be no definitive answer to this question of reading the babad's dating. The implications of these various readings

will be explored in the book's conclusion.

The single surviving manuscript witness of the Babad Jaka Tingkir presented here was inscribed in Ambon by an exile. It was written as the conclusion to a documentary history of Pakubuwana VI, large portions of which were in turn selected and copied from a Dutch-published textbook

79 THE WRITING OF A HISTORY

meant for the Javanese language education of colonial civil servants. We cannot be sure when or where the text was composed, or who its composer was. It could well have been composed in the 1840s on Ambon. Perhaps its writer was Pakubuwana VI's daughter, Raden Ayu Timur. Or, its composer could very well have been Pakubuwana VI himself, admittedly a "Auent writer" with an "extensive knowledge of traditional history," who then wrote this history (for the future) by creatively piecing and binding together the materials available to a nineteenth-century royal exile. Perhaps.

In this chapter I have considered the historical production of the single extant manuscript of a unique Babad Jaka Tingkir; and in so doing I have suggested that this text in manuscript somehow commemorates the dream of a royal exile. I cast my narrative purposely in the mode of a mystery story, in which clues and teases are serially presented and then (tentatively) read. The mystery remains unsolved at chapter's end. I have ulterior motives. Among these: by playing on the mystery, I wish to replicate for my readers some of the haunting attraction this text has

exercised upon me from the time of my first encounter with it-thereby to provoke in readers the desire to read, seriously and critically, the text of Tingkir themselves. I expect that such readings will generate understandings of the poem which will be other and likely counter to my own, and 1 welcome the projected extension of the dialogue. My analysis may be found in the chapters following the translation. But 1 strongly advise the reader to defer reading my critical analysis of the text until after completing his or her own thoughtful reading of this remarkable nineteenth century Javanese (re)reading of a Javanese past.
