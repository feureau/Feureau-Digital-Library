# Art and Politics: From Javanese Court Dance to Indonesian Art
by: Felicia Hughes-Freeland  
University of Wales Swansea

Drawing on Nelson Goodman's constructivist approach, this article argues that debates in the anthropology of art about aesthetics detract from important questions concerning the constitution of cultural diversity and the social role of categories. The claim that aesthetics is embedded in broader situations of social practice over-emphasizes cultural purity and authenticity, while the counter-claim that aesthetic experience constitutes a separable, transcendental and universal realm denies the sociocultural construction of reality. These arguments are usually applied to material objects, but here, the example of Javanese performance traditions, which include varieties of experience both more or less than 'aesthetic', is used to suggest that indigenous discourses of art are not necessarily self-sufficient and discrete. Rather, these discourses need to be set in a historical context so as to show the political significance of aesthetics and of the category of art. The neologism 'aesthemics' could assist anthropological explorations in this field.

'Art equips us for survival, conquest, and gain' (Goodman 1976: 256).

To speak of art is to speak of representations: their production, their form, their reception. Anthropologists may justify the use of categories such as 'art' and 'aesthetics' as a necessary form of analytical meta-language or 'experience-distant' categorization (Geertz 1983: 57), but necessity may result in inventions which misrepresent cases employing different categories and systems of discrimination.

A recurrent problem for anthropology has been to determine the extent to which art should be separated from, or connected to, other forms of social practice.! Western traditions of art history and appreciation have focused on the plastic form as a symbolic representation which stands in a relation of imitation to the real world.
Such traditions determine contemporary cross-cultural approaches to art. The concentration is on objects, whether or not these objects were created for aesthetic contemplation in themselves, and neglects embodied cultural practices such as dance."

Critiques of Aristotelian principles of naturalist imitation by aestheticians such as Gombrich (1960) and Goodman (1976: 1978) can help to solve the anthropological dilemma of how to contextualize art and aesthetics. Goodman in particular offers a way out of the paradox at the heart of the anthropology of art, in which judgement is central to aesthetics and marginal to anthropology (P Gow in Weiner 1994: 32).
There is an affinity between what anthropologists do and what Goodman has called a critique of world-making. He approaches art as a relativizing study of the constructions of realities ('versions') and 'the comparative study of these versions and visions of their making' (1978: 94). Bourdieu's (1984) sociological critique of the

Kantian tradition in Western aesthetics draws explicitly on Gombrich, but unwittingly approaches Goodman by arguing that art is not about things, but about struggles and conflicts to distinguish the self-in-the-group from others. To Bourdieu, these struggles constitute art as capital for cultural politics. For Goodman, more radically, the making and appreciation of art are stakes which vary in significance historically; it is not the beautiful and the true which are at issue, but the appropriate: "Truth and its aesthetic counterpart amount to appropriateness under different names' (1976; 264). The power to define appropriateness must be struggled for.

This article argues that art and aesthetics are contingent concepts or attributes, not essential capacities which emerge at some stage in socio-cultural development. Drawing on research on social change carried out in Indonesia between 1982 and 1994, I focus on 'high' art with reference to Javanese dance performance to demonstrate that 'art' is not a cultural given. Rather, it is used in the processes of cultural production to define appropriateness, and entails struggles for power and identity. If, as Weiner suggests, 'nationalism has powerfully enhanced the aestheticisation of politics which has been such a key component of twentieth century modernism in Europe and North America' (1994; 1), I argue that the reverse is true of post-colonial states such as Indonesia. Rather than follow Baudrillard's (1983) extreme replacement of verity by versions which mark the end of reality, I follow Goodman in asking not 'What is Art?" but 'When is Art?
(1978: 59). However much one characterizes the contemporary West in terms of

postmodern pastiche, art is not everywhere-in-the-world. Starting from this contingent 'when-ness' of art, which contrasts with the aestheticization of reality in postmodernism, I explore the historical conditions of the Javanese case, and ask whether a firm line may be drawn between Western aesthetics and Javanese practices as understood by anthropologists and some Javanese. Despite the Indonesian ideological separation of culture and politics, this case will furnish evidence of a politicization of aesthetics.

Court and country

The Indonesian anthropologist Koentjaraningrat (1985) presents his account of Javanese culture with reference to the spheres of urban and rural. This is reminiscent of R.Williams's (1973) emphasis on a cultural distinction between town and country, and provides a useful starting point for understanding what may be regarded alternatively as two different models of aesthetics or as the limit of the aesthetic. Koentjaraningrat notes that Javanese people value regional diversity, not cultural homogeneity, a view expressed in statements about cultural politics since the 1930s, when nationalists invoked 'local peaks' as a model for cultural development. However, the cultures of the Javanese urban court centres which emerged in dynamic interaction with developing colonial interests have tended to become a focus for Javanese art: the further one moves away from these 'exemplary centres' (Anderson 1972), the greater the diffusion and dilution of power and its attributes, including the patronage of the arts. This model, deriving from the court centres whose interests it represents, suggests

that aesthetics is highly developed in the urban courts, and much less so in the rural peripheries. It results in a polarization of quality, represented in the oftThis content downloaded from 180.253.221.195 on Fri, 16 Feb 2018 05:53:09 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms

cited and much-misunderstood opposition between alus and kasar ('refined' and 'coarse'), implying that alus is aesthetic and kasar is not.* The anthropological view that art is embedded in social contexts diverges from this Javanese theory of cultural distinction and taste, proposing instead that aesthetic value will be found across all contexts. Appropriate as it is to recognize local discourses, the contextualist approach needs to take account of the political resonances of the naming of a socio-cultural practice as art. Otherwise it risks falling into a naive and sentimental view of local 'wellsprings' (Armstrong 1975).

Javanese court culture emphasizes physical performance, including dancing, as an activity which reveals the distinction between alus and kasar. In the case of Java, the problem of the analytical separability of dance is homologous to that of the separability of art. There are precedents in philosophy for including dance in the category of art." Anthropologists have largely ignored these debates, and until recently have produced essentializing functionalist accounts of the social use of objects without giving due consideration to the cultural specifics of what the category of aesthetics might include. Dance was analysed as part of ritual

until the 1970s, when it became differentiated through the use of contextual linguistic and semantic models (Hanna 1979; Royce 1977; D. Williams 1982).

It has been claimed that an a priori categorical separation of dance from other art forms falsifies local conditions which may constitute a context of fine distinctions between the different kinds of meaning borne by different kinds of body movement (Kaeppler 1985). Yet actors as well as analysts reconstitute categories by separation and conjunction, depending on chance and circumstance.
To start from diverse and often strategic uses of 'experience-near' concepts in socio-political manoeuvres need not preclude the 'non-local'. If it seems unjustifiable at the outset to expect that a Western-based system of response to objets might stretch to include systems which inscribe distinction in bodily practices as well as in things, I will argue that it is equally unjustifiable to assume that cultures are discrete and exclusive. We will discover that in some Javanese dance discourses, there are discriminations which are local, and others which are not.

It is impossible to understand the uses of the concept of art in Java without understanding how Javanese ideas about aesthetic desirability are situated. I will briefly describe two occasions which exemplify the antithesis between the refined and the coarse, and then turn to commentaries which position these occasions in relation to art."

Court: rehearsing a Bedhaya dance

It is night. Within the outer walls of the Sultan's palace in Yogyakarta, beneath the steeply-roofed pavilion of a princely residence, nine young women move in slow motion to the sound of a gamelan orchestra as three female voices sing of kingly prowess. We are at a rehearsal for the annual concert of Siswa Among Beksa, the dance organization claiming to originate in 1952, when the Sultan entrusted the court performance traditions for royal weddings, birthdays and state receptions to his younger brother, Yudanégara." At this rehearsal, it is his widow who corrects the dancers, reminding them to turn up their toes as they process onto the floor in a solemn march made militaristic by the addition of a

side-drum to the gamélan. The organization is run by the son of the Sultan's eldest sister, and although its members increasingly come from state performance institutes, it still includes a number of aristocratic children who do not aspire to be professional performers.

Court performance includes a broad range of styles and forms (HughesFreeland 1991). The Bédhaya is the most elaborate and difficult form for women, given its slowness and duration - it lasted ninety minutes at this rehearsal. The dancers move as smoothly and effortlessly as possible, unceasingly: as a movement phase (beksa) ends on the strike of the large gong, a wrist turns or the neck undulates. 'Every count of the music should be filled' says Bu Yudanégara, the teacher, explaining that the aesthetic effect of toya mili (flowing water') is what makes court dance movement for women in Yogyakarta alus ('refined'). The key to the sinuous but controlled movement 'like that of a lizard' is in the neck (fig. 1). Sinuous and sensual as the movement is, dance teachers emphasize that effective alus-ness excludes eroticism, flirtatiousness and coyness. Bu Yudanégara trains a female dancer to secure the aesthetic effect of sexual detachment by controlling her gaze, lowering it to a point on the floor ahead at a distance of not more than twice her height (fig. 2).

Bu Yudanégara's aesthetic derives from years of performing and teaching dance, and she expresses it practically in training and choreography. She learned a performance philosophy from the famous former dancer, Prince Suryobrongto, who explained the need for balance between four elements: concentration, dynamism, self-confident humility and resolution (Hughes-Freeland 1997). Excessive dynamism results in an excess of naturalness which is kasar, the opposite of approved alus action. The aesthetic of alus requires the dancer to find a balance between tension and fluidity, a concept called kéncèng (see the fingers in fig. 38). The appearance should be one of cultivation which appears easy and natural.

This philosophy encapsulates a palace ethos in which dance movement has an educational function, explicit in court practices between 1920 and 1939, and today preserved in the attitudes of the generation of dancers of that time who pass it on to their pupils. It belongs to the ethos of performance as service to the Sultan, excluded from the sphere of commercial exchange. Court performance is for honour, not cash. Herein lies its aesthetic value, as much as in the movement style and context of performance. Palace performance could be described as what Bourdieu (1984) has called the 'aristocracy of culture', in which fine distinctions of movement and attitude exemplify an entire code of class practice.
The audience for the Bédhaya concert consists of invited dignitaries, perhaps even the Sultan himself, families and friends of the performers, and a smattering of researchers. Ideally, the performance creates in the Javanese audience the same mood as that of the dancers. This sense of belonging is summed up in the

word rasa, a word conventionally translated as 'feelling]' but more accurately rendered as 'sense'.

This ethos and aesthetic are defined by Javanese practitioners in contrast to practices in non-court spheres, the most notorious of which is the performance of professional female performers (ledhek) at events called tayuban. For courtly

and middle-class Javanese, ledhek are the cultural antithesis of Bédhaya dancers, epitomizing all that is kasar and uncourtly.

Country: tayuban at a community thanksgiving

It is night. On the plateau to the south-east of the city of Yogyakarta, in the house of the head of a hamlet called Muntuk, three ledhek move in hesitant syncopation to the lively rhythms of a gamelan orchestra, passing a microphone between them as they take it in turns to sing traditional Javanese songs or Javanized versions of popular hits. A male octogenarian, a long red scarf round his neck, dances with angular and assertive poses, arms outstretched, knees bent and legs wide (fig. 4). The dancers and musicians have been hired from a vilFIGURE 4. The first male dancer at the night tayuban.

lage at the other end of the plateau. They retain the fee and the tips given by the men who take it in turns to dance with the women through the night into the small hours. This is a party given between two rituals for the community thanksgiving following the harvest. Earlier in the afternoon, 160 household heads had heard the prayer of the leading local religious official (modin), said their 'amens', and gone home with leaf baskets of rice and fried foods. All the rituals involve exchanges of food, cash and performance. It is this material aspect, along with the crudely rhythmic music and song and the unsubtle

interaction between men and dancers, which causes 'polite' Javanese to label tayuban as kasar.

The next morning, the troupe sets up under the sacred tree next to the well.
Pak Priyowasito, the village elder who opened the night's dancing, communes with the village spirit (dhanyang) who, he claims, secures communal and individual well-being. The villagers are less sure about the existence of the dhanyang, but having witnessed Pak Priyo's expertise at bringing people out of trance, they show their respect by supporting his annual offering to the dhanyang. Pak Priyo gives the ledhek spring water to drink, and makes them wash their feet in its water. The entire gathering gives money to the spirit and Pak Kaum, the official responsible for the local mosque, makes lists of those who wish to make requests of the spirit. He reads out names and the ledhek perform snatches of song and dance. Sponsors may dance or stand; some send representatives, or bring a tethering rope to represent a sick animal.

The performance is offered to the dhanyang who - some say - dances with the ledhek. The satisfied spirit then grants a boon. Some performances redeem vows to the dhanyang from the previous year. It is a busy traffic of exchanges in cash and performance in both the visible and invisible worlds. The ritual closes with social dancing dominated by young men who, lacking the social graces of their elders, gyrate in a Javanese disco style, making the occasional pass at the ledhek.

Tayuban constitutes a case of 'connected' art in Napier's sense (1992), in that performance is itself part of a system of gift exchanges. Also, the dancers have special efficacy, if not the specialized religious knowledge of Pak Priyo. They daub yellow face powder on babies, on animal ropes (fig. 5), and distribute it to

be taken home to the sick. The kiss of the ledhek is also lucky and curative.
However, the song and dance at teyubans do not elicit an aesthetic response. The ledhek perform with occasional grimaces of fatigue and boredom. They do not evince appraisal by the organizers or the participants in terms of their skill or beauty, despite the attempts of the troupe's founder, a retired bureaucrat with a passion for performance, to upgrade and refine their dancing. Evaluative comments are limited to praise of the new and colourful matching outfits of the dancers, and young men also compare the physiques and attractiveness of the dancers. The performance at a tayuban is normally striking for its atmosphere rather than its artistry, although at a previous tayuban in Muntuk, my research assistant and I had been impressed by the stage presence of a dancer who we later discovered had started out in kethoprak (popular theatre). The three ledhek in 1994 lacked her presence, although the face of the eldest - later described by the painter Djoko Pekik who attended the night event as the 'real' Java - and her indifference to the proceedings around her was striking (fig. 6, right). The second ledhek (fig. 6, left) was lively and impertinent and sang well; the youngest (fig. 6, centre) was shy, prone to fits of giggles, and of much interest to the young men.





















Middle-class urban Javanese regard tayuban as beyond the pale of culture and art, with nothing aesthetic to commend it. The standard of art rests with the sphere of alus, and the performance of ledhek is anything but this; it is an embarrassing anachronism. Indeed, only ten traditionally trained ledhek remain in the entire Special Administrative District of Yogyakarta." Tayubans have been discouraged by the authorities for being wasteful and posing a threat to social order; but an important contemporary influence is cultural politics, which includes debates about an appropriate definition of art. To understand the status of the category of art in contemporary Javanese society, it is necessary to consider further the background to the indigenous association of aesthetics, the court

and adiluhung ('the noble sublime'; cf. Florida 1995), a highly debated concept among the experts within court circles, and one which has been deployed with specific effect in the field of cultural politics.

The noble sublime

"Kinesthetical' as Javanese culture is (Geertz 1995: 151), semantic clusters in Javanese are not congruent with what in English is classed as 'dance' and 'art'.
There is no 'odd-job' word in the language for 'dance'. The familiar-level Javanese joged is not appropriate to use of court dance; the polite-level applies to small units of movement, such as a turn of the wrist, to sequences of movement, and to collections of movements which constitute a specific form such as Bedhaya.

Likewise, instead of generic terms for drama there are named theatrical forms shadow play, dance drama, masked dance drama - which until recently had specific associations in regard of convention and performance context. Nor is there a general term for music, sound being named for its source: gamelan refers to the sound made by a gamelan ensemble and so forth. Javanese concepts tend to be nominal in character: phenomena are organized into classes of one, in a true nominalist sense, whereas Indonesian concepts tend to be more generalizing.!9

Not surprisingly, then, there is no Javanese word for 'art', but there is an Indonesian one, kesenian or seni, glossed in an Indonesian-Javanese dictionary as kagungan adiluhung (Purwadarminta n.d.) - 'that which has adiluhung'. Adiluhung describes a class which includes court dance, music and theatre. This term resonates with a dual etymology: adi is from the Sanskrit for beginning, first' and today means 'valuable', 'precious' (Gonda 1952: 346) or 'beautiful' (Prawiroatmodjo 1980); luhung is cognate with léluhur (ancestors) and resonates with value as 'high, novel, virtuous, valued, supreme', so adiluhung is thus literally 'original value' (see Purwadarminta 1939: 277). By her eloquent gloss 'the beautiful sublime', Florida (1995: 32) deliberately inflects the term with resonances closer to Coleridge than to classical Sanskrit, in order to highlight the retrospective and situational nature of Javanese etymologies of adiluhung.

Adiluhung might seem a plausible Javanese translation of 'art' were it not for the fact that it is a bigger category than art and includes social institutions such as marriage (Horne 1974) and, more recently, the traditional Javanese make-up for brides." So while adiluhung may include practices which fit our category of 'art', it includes others which are of the more general class of 'tradition' or 'custom '. Other Javanese terms for values tend to have moral, aesthetic and spiritual resonances, which suggest that it is unhelpful to separate out a discrete aesthetic category. Adiluhung, resonant as it may be, does not include tayuban in the class of traditions or customs. Nor is it (yet) used to designate cloth and daggers, traditional marriage gifts which have become eminently collectable objets in Indonesia's art market.

Both art and adiluhung are absorbed into the category of culture, another concept not matched in Javanese or other languages from the Indonesian archipelago, and one very much associated with Indonesian nationalism. What is adiluhung has cultural value because it is handed down (naluri), and handed

down by members of the dominant class - it is the aristocracy of culture, to reiterate Bourdieu's vibrant phrase. But this resonance is more ideological than specific. Status weakens with each generation down from a family ancestor, so traditions need to be recharged to maintain their energy. And, besides, the forms which the cultural capital of the dominant class take have changed dramatically since the Javanese gained independence from the Dutch and became citizens of the Republic of Indonesia. For many Javanese, the Indonesianization of traditions has recast Javanese dance practice into a category of social action and experience different from its colonial versions.

Continuous tradition or recent invention?

An influential Dutch analysis of Old Javanese literature elicits its core aesthetic as alango, 'enraptured' and 'enrapturing'. This response has 'what we might call a "subjective" and an "objective" aspect, for there is a common element - the Indians would say: a common rasa - in both subject and object, which makes them conatural and fit to become one' (Zoetmulder 1974: 173).!2 Zoetmulder has invented an Old Javanese aesthetic which has influenced many subsequent researchers of contemporary Javanese culture. Contemporary courtly audiences explained their response to Bedhaya in terms of rasa, and in particular specified feelings of solemnity, nostalgia and homesickness (nglangut). These statements

resonate with the imputed Old Javanese aesthetic of alango, and provide the possibility for people to make retrospective claims that this is a long-established aesthetic tradition, the courtly Javanese transformation of the aesthetic canons

of classical India.

It has recently been argued that contemporary Javanese practices are neither long-established nor continuous, but that aestheticization and formalization in Java should be approached in terms of relations between the Javanese and the colonizing Dutch (Pemberton 1994). Pemberton's claim identifies adiluhung neither as ancient nor essentially Javanese, but as a marker of the coming of modernity. Many key Javanese words signalling Javaneseness and Javanese notions of order originate in the formalization and codification that occurred during the mid-nineteenth century, and as such have more in common with the codes of Dutch colonial control than any indigenous 'Javanese' culture (Pemberton 1994: 53).

The argument that what is presented today as quintessentially Javanese originated as a system of oppositions to Dutch codes, a system which defined itself using the very principles by which those codes were articulated, has had an impact on the formulation of court dance practices and aesthetic discourses (Hughes-Freeland n.d. a). It could be argued that in Yogyakarta court dance was not separated as a distinct subject for predication until the founding in 1918 of the school for training in court traditions, Kridha Bèksa Wirama, if not earlier.
Such historical conditions behind the use of labels which might appear absolute remind us of the dangers of cultural essentialism, and show 'Java' to have been made possible by the presence of not-Java in the form of the Dutch systems of

order and control (Pemberton 1994: 23).
Given these opposing views, I now consider whether the Javanese case supports the argument for aesthetic response as a distinct and separate sphere or as a

response embedded in a broader context. If Bourdieu's claim that the fundamental distinction in Kantian aesthetics is the denial of gratification in favour of a more subtle form of pleasure (1984: 5), then the aesthetic of nglangut, relating as it does to the rejection of personal gratification by Javanese priyayi (polite society) as an ethical principle represented in the aesthetics of alus, has resonances of philosophies other than those of the Sanskritic heritage. Could the Javanese response imply a sign of universality d la Kant? Or have Western commentators carried Kantian baggage into the realm of Javanese culture? Or might it be that Javanese commentators have absorbed certain Kantian principles through Dutch, and later American, education? To introduce Kant into the Javanese scene would support the non-Kantian view that aesthetics is, historically, a bourgeois category (Eagleton 1991: 4), not a universal one. Despite the risk of reviving old debates about diffusion, the close links of the court and its members with the Dutch administration of the East Indies, and current attention to the relationship of the post-colonial to the colonial, make such questions unavoidable.

Connectedness and separability

As I am an outsider with an educated British middle-class taste, the courtly Bédhaya elicited an aesthetic response from me more readily than the performance of the ledhek at the tayuban. In this I could be following Javanese judgements of courtly performance as adiluhung, a category of practice which would certainly exclude tayuban. I might have said that the beauty of Bédhaya transcended the context of its production, a separability claimed as a key criterion for whether or not something be classed as art.!" The beauty of Bédhaya which captured the imagination of the ignorant outsider that I was in 1977 would thus be a stronger candidate for the separable and transcendent aesthetic quality than the performance of ledhek at tayuban. But having said that, although Bédhaya out of context may create a strong impression for a short time, the impact of a full-length performance is difficult to sustain for unfamiliar audiences outside the palace environment.!* Before I turn to the discussion of current developments in the spheres of court and country performance, it must be stressed that the apparent transcendence of Bédhaya derives from a very specific set of circumstances and ideas, and to have knowledge of these is to have competence in understanding how to 'rasa' the performance. There are forms of appreciation of court practices which might appear to have the capacity to transcend context but nonetheless are connected to the social conditions of their emergence and enactment. Such forms of indigenous appreciation must surely concern the anthropologist as much as, if not more than, the qualities which arguably permit a form to travel as 'art'.

I have presented court performance in contrast to the 'embedded' performance at village community thank-offerings. While there is a case to be made against viewing such community rituals as representing in some cases (debased) imitations of court practice rather than traces of ancient continuous traditions tightly connected to a web of social practices (Hughes-Freeland 1993), I will concentrate here on court performance which, for all its potential separability and recent consolidations, can be understood in terms of connectedness.

One example of the connectedness of the court aesthetic refers to how movements are interpreted. Until recent educational inroads into village performance, Javanese court dance was distinguished from other performance by having named movement sequences such as 'tree in the wind' (pucang kanginan) or 'elephant rolling its trunk" (gajah ngoling). These names do not however refer to a mimetic connexion between tree or elephant and the dance movement. The relation between label and movement, following Goodman (1984), is one of exemplification: the quality of movement exemplifies the natural movement.
Other categories of movement are self-referential ('walking', 'kneeling'), exemplifying only themselves: they are named for what they do (Hughes-Freeland

1991).

The vocabulary of dance is used to made connexions by means of pun and etymologies which make sense of diverse social phenomena. For example, as noted, a common term of aesthetic approval in Yogyakarta is flowing water'.
This is applied to the aesthetic effect of processes other than dancing," and creates both unification and inter-referentiality, overriding bounded categories and neat coherences. It is appropriateness and directional (not categorical) coherence which emerge as patterns in how things are ascribed, attributed and, finally, classed.

Javanese people enjoy generating meanings. The resonance of puns is preferred to the precision of definition. Gesture x will mean y under particular conditions, but not necessarily. Whereas Goodman asked 'When is art?", the question to pose of Javanese dance is 'When is meaning?". The meaning- or absence of meaning - of dancing is negotiated with reference to the poles of mimesis and abstraction, but there is choice in the selection of references which are used to orientate the interpretation and which give priority to particular identifications. The degree of remove from denotation will also vary according to the perceiving interpreter. Dance forms include categories of movement which appear to mime actions in everyday life, such as self-adorning movements. They are thus 'samples', but are however subject to varying degrees of referentiality depending on the form. For instance, self-adorning movements in the Golek dance form may be imitative of actions external to dance movement, but in Bédhaya the movements exemplify themselves: the Javanese speak of 'abstraction' or 'for beauty', denying a link between the movement in dance and outside it. However, there is scope for what Goodman calls metaphoric displacement (1984: 61). Golek may describe a woman adorning herself, but it is also interpreted in terms of spiritual adornment. The mimetic function is thus replaced by a different kind of reference. Similarly, the opening salutation of the Bédhaya is interpreted as a gesture made to God, denotationally, or as formal and decorative, as exemplificatory. The selection of referencing results in an interpretive effect or identification which has a potential politico-religious effect.
It is possible to argue a case for Bédhaya as a Tantric or Islamic artwork, depending on what properties are selected and how they are deployed (HughesFreeland n.d. a).

Javanese experts explain the social significance of Javanese court dancing as more than the sum of its meanings. They experience dancing not as shared text

or meanings, but as a shared breathing, a commonality between the rhythms of the dancers' movements, the music, and one's own heartbeat.'* These Javanese

interpretations derive from the 'Mataram Dance', a philosophy propounded by Suryobrongto. The dancer does not reach out to the audience ex-pressively but achieves 'expression' by an inward focus which might be described as inpression." Rather than responding to the willed and communicative presence of the dancer's intentions, the audience is caught up in the mood of the event: its music, its movements, its fragrances, its diversions.

Dancing takes place at events which include a broad range of aesthetic appeal.
During the 1920s and 1930s dance events were status displays which represented exchange systems based on honour. The elaborate performance was accompanied by lively exchanges of language, goods and money as audience members engaged in lower-level exchanges, gambling for money as the performances took place. The three-day long performances of dance-drama confounded the possibility of an intense quality of attention on the part of the audience: Holt reports that only the Dutch guests paid attention (1967). Any contextual analysis of the world-making aesthetic of such events would require a recognition that the aesthetic is connected in exchange relations, with art itself performing in a gift exchange (Napier 1992). We are moved from meaning to power, from transcendence as non-instrumental to the instrumentality of art, and to the significance of such power and instrumentality in the field of social experience.

Distinction in Java?

The conventional anthropological analysis of Javanese priyayi culture in respect of power and virtue conjoins ethics, politics and aesthetics (Anderson 1972; Geertz 1960). The resulting model gives a world view in which alus is contrasted to the base desires for pleasure (hawa nafsu); between these is the mark of socially acceptable, albeit degraded, enjoyment (enak, literally, 'delicious').
Morality increases as one moves towards alys. The morality is also localized: in the early 1980s it was common for Yogyakartans to praise their alus performance in contrast to the 'lively' (linca) style of the Surakartan court. For nonJavanese Indonesians, alus is flattened to mean an etiolated slowness, the caricatured stereotype of Javanese in the eyes of Balinese, Sumatrans, and other ethnic groups. Alus therefore is a conceptual nexus, which from one angle appears to support a case for a connected aesthetics as a kind of potency, but from other angles is a familiar opposition between pleasure and desire. This opposition excludes any catalysing potential of Javanese appropriations (and rejections) of particular Islamic aesthetics which could also be credited with defining aesthetic response in terms of a moral eye.!®

The duality (at least) of alus is represented in two approaches to the classification of forms and movement modes. Court dance teachers ranked forms on a scale from abstract/alus to dramatic/mimetic. Fighting dances, which are neither whole forms or fragments from larger forms, are the most dramatic. These contrast with Bédhaya, which includes the least 'natural', most abstracted, representation of fighting. Conflict is codified so elaborately that the physical expression is invisible to those who do not already know that these dances represent conflict. Conflict is interpreted at a remove from the physical and the oppositional, in terms of unification and unity.

Dance discourses generate resonance between the aesthetic and the spiritual but a boundary is drawn. In conversation Suryobrongto was careful to distinguish dancing from psycho-spiritual techniques (1976). Although he represented an apparently connected courtly aesthetic, and claimed that all dance movement is alus, he nonetheless stated his boundary in terms of spiritual techniques and spiritual arts: court dance-drama belonged to the latter category, not the former. This rationalization is reminiscent of the Western Enlightenment impulse to rid the reasonable person of superstition. Suryobrongto articulated his theory of spiritual arts very carefully so as to allow court practice to transcend the 'connected' lack of artistry of trance dance - denoting a lack of control - found in urban and village contexts outside the court (Hughes-Freeland

1997).

Suryobrongto thus uses an all-encompassing concept of alus to characterize court performance, but is careful to inflect that alus-ness with a sense of reasoned control and consciousness against the 'barbaric' practices of trancers outside the court. In one sense, then, his dance philosophy referred to above could be seen to represent Kant in Java, with alus being a mark of distinction. But he also ranked drama lower than dance, the intentionality of the actor being too removed from an inner state of alus-ness.

A more overtly separatist approach to aesthetics informs a different scheme for classifying movement modes in Yogyakarta. Here, movement is organized in

an oppositional scheme along a scale from alus to kasar. This refers back overtly to the pedagogic modernism of Kridha Beksa Wirama, the first court-sponsored performance school in Yogyakarta which aimed to make the 'feudal' performance traditions more democratic by opening up the training to outsiders and by formalizing their teaching methods. Suryobrongto's scheme classifies all dance as alus and the different movement modes are identified according to styles of movement associated with some of the main characters of the shadow puppet theatre, whereas the second scheme movement is organized around a more simple binary scheme (Soedarsono et al. 1978: 67-8). These two classifications are structured by different principles (nominalist and essentialist), but they show that styles of formalization and rationalization within what appears from the outside to be a tiny elite, are not uniform. These two different twentieth, century court dance ideologies derive from male aristocrats of two successive generations and can be said to represent a fracture in courtly approaches to aesthetics. The former represents a moralist connectedness, albeit with Kantian overtones, the latter a rationalized 'modernism'. Interestingly, Soedarsono, likewise a former dancer, more recently (1984: 220-9) adopts Suryobrongto's scheme for understanding Yogyakartan dance classifications, rather than employing that of Kridha Beksa Wirama.

From adiluhung to art?

Elsewhere I presented Suryobrongto's view as being superseded by that of the educational modernists (Hughes-Freeland 1991), but overlooked the conditions which gave rise to his formulation of his 'Mataram Dance' philosophy,

Joged Mataram. During a later research visit to Yogyakarta, I discovered that Joged Mataram was the result of a series of seminars held in the early 1970s to

which senior courtiers and performers were invited. The rationale was to devise a coherent account of Javanese dance before setting off on a European tour.

The point is that this apparent discourse of connectedness was also a discourse necessitated by the fact that there was a cultural other to confront, in a vein similar to the processes discussed by Pemberton in the mid-to-late-nineteenthcentury Surakartan court. The formulations of culture here are occasioned by inter-cultural encounters, although the resources for arriving at these formulations come from different sources, local and external.

Some are pessimistic about the effect of the Indonesian nation state on local ritual practices. Acciaioli's argument (1985) that 'practice' is being forced into 'spectacle' tends to ignore power play and contingency in 'practice', and slips into an opposition between connectedness and separability. My claim here is that the situatedness and processes which produce such events make a simple opposition between the connected and separable nature of aesthetics rather difficult to sustain. Napier's critique of Western art sets up a contrastive scheme with Balinese practices, opposing egocentrism to collectivism, full-time artistry to periodic ritual cycles, materialist commodity to symbolic connectedness (1992: 31-3), Cartesian dualism to somatization (1992: 160-5), and alienation to nourishedness (1992: 170-1)."

If connectedness tends to move us to a myth of authenticity, separateness encourages over-enthusiasm for seeing comparison in terms of similarity while ignoring the bits that do not fit. For example, there is a spiritual resonance in Suryobrongto's account, which in Soedarsono (1984) is secularized or, more accurately, converted to culture and nationalism: an aestheticized representation of identity replaces a religious one.

The Javanese material is also resistant to Kant in respect of transcendence. For Kant, art is not the object of judgement in an 'everyday' sense, nor does art have 'everyday' utility. In Java, 'art' is an object of judgement with reference to alus which extends to the everyday. As in Kant, it is not a commodity: adiluhung is part of a value system distinguished from the 'everyday' in so far as it is not to be exchanged as a commodity (i.e. it transcends economic utility), but it is given references and identifications with everyday life. The anti-Kantian aesthetic comes in here: it sets up a contest to establish a system of distinction and value (currently labelled 'national development').

Both Suryobrongto's and Soedarsono's accounts of court dance interact with the foreign and the future and have a concern with aesthetic distinction. However, while a Western aesthetic resonance may be present, it is also crucial to recall that Kant has a quasi-spiritual notion of transcendence in psycho-physical experience: his aesthetic response rests on a separation of mind-body and object. The Javanese tradition, like many non-Western ones, understands that bodily techniques may be prerequisites for transcending the body (Vatsyayan 1980: 8). The notion of a process moving from the body to transcendence is very different from the Kantian one of transcendence based in a response to objects; it represents the rationalist move in Kant in which spiritual experience transforms into aesthetic experience. Not all cultures can be said to have the same historical trajectory in their theoretical formulations. If we have in Indonesia the development of what appears to be a hierarchy of taste, in which the 'aristocracy of culture' refers to the culture of the aristocracy, there is a lack of emergence of other

categories which accompany cultural production: categories such as professional versus amateur, and critics able to pronounce on aesthetic value. At this point, criticism is not a culturally developed discourse in the region; it remains emergent.

Although the inclusion of somatic experience in the aesthetic might undermine the very distinctions which make Kantian aesthetics possible, there are nonetheless signs of Kant in particular court discourses of dance in Yogyakarta.
To ascribe a practice as adiluhung is to establish identifications. Florida's gloss of adiluhung as 'the beautiful sublime' (1995; 32) brings it into a frame which shares the aesthetics of the West. Specifically, it reiterates Coleridge's poetics in which beauty is a sensory mode of appeal, while hierarchy transforms the appeal to that of the sublime (Burke 1969; 325). Adiluhung is a rhetorical device used in contemporary cultural politics, and in the struggle for power and the control of meaning. Adiluhung dissimulates hierarchy in the name of Javanese tradition, but it is also a term which provides the preconditions for Indonesian 'art' (kesenian) which likewise dissimulates hierarchy in the name of the New Order (the political regime in Indonesia since 1966) and its forms of nationalism and cultural politics. The chief structure of this dissimulation rests, firstly, on the notion that these are modern transformations of ancient practices and, secondly, on the illusion that culture is distinct from politics. Current Indonesian rhetoric insists on this separation.

This case implies that transcendence is not the sine qua non of aesthetic value, though it is one of the political traceries which aesthetics permits. If we shift our perspective from a top-down model, the invocation of a social practice or interest as 'art' gives those associated with the court by birth or occupation a way to reorientate the traditional hierarchy in Java to the emergent social classes of contemporary Indonesia. Adiluhung itself becomes an argument about art, which is an argument about social relations and new forms of status. It remains at the level of production and practice, not of consumerism. Those who speak of adiluhung are concerned with membership of a group, not the ownership of scarce art valuables: and this is why bodily performance is so important in the debate.
The artistry is embodied in the very self which seeks to re-identify itself to the modern future of Indonesia while at the same time using the capital of past forms of belonging.

Indeed, it is possible to frame these changes using Bourdieu's arguments about the forms of capital which structure distinction, and present the Javanese transformations of adiluhung as family capital being moved to another context."" This transformation started with the founding of Kridha Beksa Wirama (see above) when, in 1918, two royal brothers aspiring to a nationalist modernity developed the schooling system. What had been family capital even then was being converted into educational capital. In independent Indonesia people try to establish niches by using the art category and the concept of the professional artist.
Since 1962, the training of young men and women in academies to earn their living through performance has been a major factor determining who dances.
Many of these learn 'classical' or courtly traditions, along with regional and contemporary styles. The problem for these young dancers is that there is a very

limited market for professional performers. Despite the modernity of their qualifications, they emerge into a traditionally inflected reward system. The

tradition of dancing for honour, not cash, appears in the Indonesian economy as the honorarium economy: it is rare for graduates to earn professional salaries. In this way, the status of the performers, the nature of the performance experience, and the place of the performance are all further implicated in the socioeconomic structure.

The sharp end of the adiluhung ideology is its impact on spheres of traditional professionalism such as that of ledhek in tayuban who find that modern educational systems produce pseudo-ledhek who perform in state-sanctioned versions of tayuban, bypassing the traditionally trained dancers (Hughes-Freeland 1993).
Having said that, ledhek have expressed their pleasure at having the chance to perform in 'show' fayuban at Independence Day festivities. They too actively seek an 'artistic' niche, and are keen to improve their status and reputation.
There is engagement and brokerage with the adiluhung at grass roots level; it is not only a case of top-down implementation.

These transformations are accompanied by a radical alteration in the relationship between performance, audience and symbolic function. The relationship of Javanese performance to the notion of 'art' is changing: the patronage of performance and changes in the categorization of performance alter the way in which meaning is attributed to movement. While there has been a convergence between the relativization inherent in anthropology and the rejection of authoritative narratives by postmodernism, this ethnographic case demonstrates that an aesthetic not based on imitation is moving, ironically, towards a mimetic view of art, at the moment when Western aesthetes are becoming post-mimetic.
As Western theorists of art move away from classical principles of imitation, Indonesian practices move towards it. Goodman's extensional theory helps resolve problems of interpretation which arise from crude assumptions about correspondences between gestures or movements and phenomenally extraneous objects. Objects and actions in Yogyakartan palace dance have been identified with values rather than with 'natural' objects, but there are trends to commoditize these traditions, and one strategy is to introduce a mimetic codification to the art of dance. Cultural trends in Indonesia are tending to process traditional performance towards a denotational system of codified meanings.
During the late 1980s, there were discussions on how the court might be developed in association with a long-term series of soft loans from Japan. One proposal was to codify the dances so that every gesture was given its meaning.
Another was to have a block of rooms for 'visiting researchers'. This ordering of cultural sense, and the repression of resonance, is reminiscent of nineteenthcentury formalization described by Pemberton. But, in this case, the trope is not to distinguish Java from the Dutch, but to make Java a cultural resource for Indonesian and overseas consumers: orderly culture is assumed to be more tempting than the dynamics of disorder, a more complex form of order than that perceived by the official experts.

So, while postmodernist and millenarian discourses of nostalgia and chaos set the tone for Western self-scrutiny, Indonesian official orientations aspire to consolidation and the pattern of nature in the modern nation state. The act of dancing by the bodies of Indonesian citizens is a powerful symbol of control: but in order to curb the resonances of traditional practice, contextually defined and nominal in feel, the label adiluhung needs to be invoked in order to create a

'tradition-as-art' category. Such a category can then be removed from the historical contexts (themselves variously museumized or appropriated by powerful families), and commoditized at home and, more importantly, to foreign tourists and in overseas embassies and concert halls. Javanese court arts and 'primitive' arts such as the carvings of the Asmat tribe of West Papua are packaged and processed with an uninformed audience in mind to promote Indonesian state interests overseas (Hughes-Freeland 1989). This application of adiluhung in conjunction with its opposite (primitive carvings!) as art for state purposes accords with Goodman's connexion of art with appropriation and domination (see the epigraph to this article). The process is at work in other areas: since 1990 the Court Festival has become part of the 'Calendar of Events' in Java and includes fashion shows of court dress (fig. 7) - very adiluhung! And yet, ideologically, the theme of connectedness is there: an official from the ministry of tourism explained that the festival was free because it was 'a gift from the government to the people'. The massive Indonesian-American Co-operation (Koperasi Indonesia Amerika Serikat) of 1990 resulted in a spate of glossy art books about objects, despite the important role played by performance. These events present art as culture, not politics, but ultimately they are cultural politics.""

Conclusions

The current moment is not a move from adiluhung to art: the notion of adiluhung itself is one aspect of the aestheticization and involution of practice which is neither connected to a timeless tradition nor a complete invention.
The past to which it looks back is the time before the institutions which make such practices possible, a mythic past which serves ideological interests and satisfies a sense of inexorably developing identity. So adiluhung is not what art develops from. Rather, it is a contested and catalysing notion, which strategically (if unintentionally) brings the past into the future through small and large struggles to maintain face and find a way forward.

In anthropological approaches to art, the aesthetic needs to be approached by exploring the range of references available to social actors, and the range of deployment for these references in identifications of different kinds, which include different motivated discourses - rationales, ideologies, status moves, and invocations. I have been considering the status and characteristics of art and representations in relation to Javanese dance. I have shown that the wholesale application of Western aesthetic presuppositions concerning imitation and substance is ethnographically and theoretically inadequate, and have drawn heuristically on the work of Goodman to counteract ethnographic images of 'the Javanese' as essentializing functionalists. However, while there are moments in Javanese discourse where they appear as nominalist constructivists, we have seen that there are also arguments which approximate to structural-functional ideologies of coherence and legitimation at any price, echoed in the ceaseless emphasis on order and harmony.

As postmodernism deconstructs received categories of analysis within Western genealogies of understanding, anthropology continues its fundamental project: to destabilize and question both the presuppositions and the objects of analysis, and to arrive at an account which is as free as possible from prior notions. Anthropology may at present coincide with postmodern deconstructivist styles, but has had a relativizing heuristic since its modernist inception. It might perhaps be helpful for the anthropology of art to coin a term to show that aesthetics is being challenged: it could be that 'aesthemics' might do that job.

To recognize that aesthetics is a function of power is to answer 'No' to the question 'Is aesthetic value reducible to transcendency?' (Wolff 1983). To claim that aesthetic response is the discourse of domination sends us down the path of determinism which raises problems about human creativity and choice. By asking 'art' to include embodied arts such as dance, we also challenge Western traditions of aesthetic transcendence and restore the inquiry back to the sphere of social action. This sphere does not automatically imply 'connectedness', but rather the means by which practices are made to seem connected. This would suggest that aesthetics in anthropology must include an account of instrumentality. In the framework of anthropological inquiry, then, aesthetics is implicated in power play; it is a part of social relations, not of objects, and is thus an aspect of social identity. The aesthetic is therefore more than a property of objects and of responses to them. It is the manifestation of socially effective interpretations, which refer to ideas gathered over time, and which are articulated in particular ways by particular groups at particular times and places.

NOTES

I am grateful to the Evans Trust, Cambridge (1989) and to the British Academy (1994) for funding the research on which this article is based. My thanks also go to Stephanie Jones and Mark Hobart for their comments on drafts of this article. The article was the runner-up for the 1995 J.B. Donne Essay Prize in the Anthropology of Art.

1 Weiner 1994 summarizes the debates, and Napier 1993 presents the case for embeddedness. Seminal discussions are in Armstrong 1975; Bateson 1978; Bourdieu 1984; Coote & Shelton 1992; Dutton 1977; Forge 1973; Jopling 1971; Layton 1981; Maquet 1979; Otten 1971; Smith 1961.

2 One reason is that objects can be framed as art by being put in museums. There are exceptions to this pattern (Munn 1973), but art is mostly about 'things'. Fischer (Fischer et al.
1994) asks anthropologists to explore the category of 'folk art' and its makers. He considers the material accessories of Javanese performance, such as masks and hobby horses, but he excludes the performances which make social sense of these objects. Even Bourdieu, while claiming art to be 'a bodily thing' excludes the bodily performance arts from aesthetic consideration, identifying music - 'the most "pure" and "spiritual" of the arts' - as 'simply the most corporeal' (1984: 80).

3 Overing (1990) has applied Goodman's concept of world-making to elucidate Amazonian shamanic chants. Layton (1997; 126-7) draws attention to interesting parallels between 'style' in Gombrich (1960) and 'discourse' in Foucault (1972).

4 Geertz (1960) characterized an entire ideal social type in terms of the alus ideology: the urban-oriented prijaji, who include aristocrats and court officials.

5 Collingwood (1972: 17-20) and Goodman (1984: 29) favour epistemological approaches to art, and use language as a metaphor with which to explore art as a symbol system. Following Vico, Collingwood claimed dance as the mother of language, but denied that the language of

art could be translated to another medium.
6 I have selected two occasions for which visual documents are available: for the court

Bédhaya, see Hughes-Freeland (1988) and for the village tayuban, Hughes-Freeland (1996).
7 During the 1950s, President Soekarno favoured dance performance from Bali or from the

other central Javanese court at Surakarta, and Yogyakartan dance was somewhat eclipsed. After international recognition of the Republic of Indonesia, Sultan Haméngku Buwana IX lived mostly away from his court and held office in the both Old and New Order governments, becoming Vice-President (1973-1978). Patronage of court arts was not his top priority, but dancing was reinstated in the palace proper in 1973.

8 Compare this with a French seventeenth-century account of aristocratic form:

This civility is perceived in the features, the manner, in the slightest actions of the body and mind ... one is charmed by it, without realizing where it comes from ... For everything that is done out of constraint or servitude, or has any trace of coarseness, destroys it ... This air of ease which comes from a fortunate birth and an excellent habit is one of the amenities of a gentleman; he should set about even the most difficult task with such detachment that it seems to cost him no effort (Chevalier de Méré in Bourdieu 1984: 71).

9 Traditionally, female dancers followed an apprenticeship system, receiving a smaller part of the earnings than their instructress. In a survey in 1994, I was unable to check up on every troupe I had studied in 1989, but tqyuban organisers implied that some had ceased to perform.

10 Howell identifies a lack of orderly classificatory structures among the egalitarian Chewong of Malaysia (1984). The collectivization and generalization of specific concepts is found in spheres other than dance. The Indonesian term used for a ceremonial event is upacara. Its Old Javanese meaning was rather less general: 'requisites, accessories, paraphernalia; the proper adornments, appurtenance, insignia; the proper conduct, rites, etiquette' (Zoetmulder 1982: 2128). Interestingly, Bédhaya dancers used to perform as bearers of the royal regalia during court ceremonial processions: today the dancers symbolize rather than literally bear the attributes of royalty.

11 Martha Tilar's company sponsors the Javanese courts to promote its cosmetics and is developing a new kind of fashion and make-up show which is currently being processed to fit

the requirements of high court art.
12 I consider the relation of rasa in Indian and Javanese traditions elsewhere (HughesFreeland 1997).

13 This view was expressed, for instance, by a British artist during a recent debate on BBC Radio 4 concerning the inclusion of ritually taboo objects in an exhibition of African art at the Royal Academy of Arts (Oct 1995 - January 1996).

14 Yogyakartan Bédhaya are usually not longer than ninety minutes, and many new choreographies are shorter. The Bédhaya Kétawang in the Kasultanan palace in Surakarta has been known to last for up to two and a half hours.

15 For instance, the steady provision of tea and snacks, the sound of the wooden xylophone (gambang), and the eschatological philosophy of 'whence and whither' (sangkan paraning dumadi).

16 This connected response resembles what Armstrong calls the 'affecting presence', the capacity of a work to bear power directly in such a way that it is experienced as more than a symbol (1975: 13). Similarly, one dance philosopher rejects symbolism in favour of experience: 'Human movement does not symbolise reality, it is reality. The experiences it provides are unique, they are not merely vicarious reflections of our real-life experience, through the medium of our symbolism' (Best 1978: 137).

17 When the Indian writer and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore visited Java and saw female dancing in the Mangkunagaran court in Surakarta he was impressed by its 'deliberate avoidance of obviousness' (1928: 172) - a true mark of distinction.

18 For an account of the aesthetics of performances at a graduation ceremony of an Islamic English course, see Geertz 1995; 145-51.

19 Napier expresses the contrast between art and what he calls 'cultural ecology' (1992: 33) as follows: 'The Balinese attach themselves to the navel of the earth, whereas we dream of the pioneer life or the weekend retreat, the house in the country wherein we may "really" be ourselves' (1992: 146). His claim that cultures thrive on a healthy absorption of the foreign may be compared to Taussig's (1993) contention that mimicry involves the appropriation of the outsider, as in the case of Cuna mola embroideries representing the HMV dog and phonogram.

20 I use 'family' here in the broadest sense; while blood relationships matter in particular court contexts, the ideology of the Sultan's palace has been incorporative, and many talented people of lowly birth have been assimilated into the court circle.

21 Other performance spheres raise problems of separability. In September 1994, I attended a powerful concert of poetry and music by Emha Ainun Nadjib and the Pak Kanjeng Community. The community spirit of such artistic innovation supposedly 'connects' creativity to tradition in an Islamic key. However, were he to conduct a European tour, Emha anticipated the audience having difficulties with the Islam and the political references in the poetry (HughesFreeland n.d. b). The Yogyakarta concert was cancelled owing to a dispute about a poem which criticized the government - which brings us back, not to 'what' but to 'when' can art be?

Art et politique: de la dance de cour javanaise a art indonésien

Résumé

Inspiré de l'approche constructiviste de Nelson Goodman, cet article soutient que les débats sur Pesthétique en anthropologie de l'art détournent attention de questions importantes concernant la constitution de la diversité culturelle et le role social des catégories. Tandis que le postulat que que I'esthétique est inscrite dans des situations de pratique sociale plus extensives accorde une importance trop grande a la pureté et I'authenticité culturelles, le postulat converse selon lequel expérience esthétique constitue un domaine séparable, transcendant et universel nie la construction socio-culturelle de la réalité. Ces arguments sont généralement appliqués aux objets matériels. Ici cependant exemple des traditions de representations spectaculaires javanaises - qui comportent des expériences variées a la fois plus et moins qu'esthétiques - est utilisé pour suggérer que les discours indigenes sur 'art ne sont pas nécessairement autarciques et discrets. Au contraire, ces discours doivent étre placés dans un contexte historique afin de montrer la signification politique de Pesthétique et de Part comme catégorie. Le néologisme 'esthémique' peut servir aux explorations anthropologiques dans ce domaine.
