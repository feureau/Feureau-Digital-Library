## Ranggawarsita's historiography
For it is evident that Ranggawarsita should not be judged by the standards of modern histo- riography. The standard to be applied is that of pujangga-ship

## Pujangga
We need not enter here into the origin of the much discussed word pujangga, Most of what has been written and speculated about this word has been summarized by Professor Gonda in his Sanskrit in Indonesia (1952). (Loc. cit., pp. 371-375; see also: W. Aichsele, Bhujangga, in: Oriens Extremus, vol. II (1955), pp. 109-120.)

Ranggawarsita, the Pustaka Raja Madya and the Wayang madya
By G. W. J. Drewes

In another ms., being an autograph copy of R. M. Sumahatmaka's Sérat Babad ila-ila, compiled in 1912, I came across a somewhat different statement. The 22nd chapter of this compilation deals with the history of the wayang. At the end of this chapter, which is based on the well-known Sastramiruda of Pangeran Kusumadilaga, the editor has added some information concerning the origin of the wayang madya, to the effect that Ranggawarsita made Mangkunagara IV a present of a copy of his Pustaka Raja Madya; that the Prince ordered wayang plays to be made on the basis of this work, and that the size of the puppets required for these plays be that of the wayang purwa set Kyai Sebet, which had been completed shortly before, This order was issued in 1867.

The puppets were made by and under the supervision of R.M.A. Tandakusuma, Mangkunagara IV's son-in-law and a brother of R.M.T. Yudanagara, the grandfather of Dr Poerbatjaraka. In Mangkunagaran tradition no corroboration was found for Dr Pigeaud's supposition that R.M.A. Tandakusuma was the author of the majority of the wayang madya plays. He is held in memory as a marvellous topeng dancer, whom the Prince's eldest daughter chose for her husband, and is also remembered because of his concern with the development of the langéndriyan, the Javanese opera, in which all parts are filled by women and which has become a speciality of the Mangkunagaran. This highly stylized entertainment is said to have developed from a kind of operetta originally performed by female workers employed in the batik shop of a Mr. Gottlieb, situated in the Sala kampung which after him is still named Godliban.

According to an oral account, Tuwan Godlib (also spelled Godlip or Godliep) was the owner of a batik-making company. Even today a suburb where he used to live is named after him: Godliban.

Given the fact that it was once usual for a dhalang to marry his gender player, a functionalist and economic rationale is possible. It is easier for a dhalang to perform with a familiar accompanist; it is easier, for a variety of reasons, to travel with one’s wife than someone else; and it is more economical to keep all the profit earned at an event in the same family. I even heard one dhalang who performed in the old-style invoke the usualness of this situation by inserting into his narrative a joke about his ‘wife’ (estriné) when, by chance, his gender player for the evening was momentarily replaced by a male performer who could play in the old- or female-style (Bapak Gandasukasno 12 March 1991). But these functional explanations alone cannot explain the significance the dhalang and musicians quoted above accorded to the female style of gender accompaniment, in particular its power to ensure a correct rasa for the wayang performance. Rasa is a complicated word in that it conveys multiple meanings simultaneously. Studies of Javanese aesthetics have observed the dual nature of rasa, suggesting that the term is associated both with emotional release and with restraint; with educated refinement and unreserved human response; with controlled rightful order and cataclysmic chaos (Judith Becker 1993; Benamou 1998, 2002; Weiss 2003; Zoetmulder 1995). One aspect of rasa that has not been fully explored is the gendering of rasa as both male and female. While the predictable pairing of maleness with refinement and femaleness with emotional excess certainly functions, this alignment is not the only one represented in Javanese myths and stories, in particular those in which fertility and continuity of tradition are the subject. The myths told about female gender players and other legendary Javanese women generally revolve around the pairing of two sets of opposites, aspects of chaos and order – as in emotional release and restraint – and maleness and femaleness. In these myths, order and chaos are always gendered but neither is always male or female. The multiple intersections between these pairings results in a generative, prosperity-ensuring interaction (Pemberton 1994:197-216).

How, then, is it possible for this kind of dynamic interaction to be articulated as an aesthetic? In the introduction to her Engendering song; Singing and subjectivity in Prespa Albanian song, Jane Sugarman (1997) outlines and critiques two theoretical approaches often employed by ethnomusicologists in their work on aesthetics: the identification of homologies reflected on many levels in the culture (Judith Becker and Alton Becker 1981) and the documentation and organization of what people say about performance commonly referred to as ethnoaesthetics (Robertson 1979). Sugarman points out that the former is too removed from practice and the latter too near for any kind of comparative interpretation. In practice much ethnomusicological work on aesthetics has combined the two approaches (Feld 1988; Turino 1993; Rice 1994; Brinner 1995). Of course, with any approach to the description of the aesthetics of a group there has to be at some level an assumed unity of experience and perspective among the people who make up the group. This is one of the problems Rice (2003) has been wrestling with in his subjectcentred musical ethnography. Although he does not articulate it in exactly these terms, Rice argues that starting from the subject’s thoughts and experiences – interaction with both the global and the local (place) and through time – allows the ethnomusicologist to generate interpretation based on the intersection between the group of individual experiences documented and the composite that emerges from the comparison of them in context. His use of the concept of metaphor resonates with the way in which the Beckers and Feld have used the Piercian term, iconicity. In his analysis of Kaluli performative culture, Feld (1988:92-4) describes an aesthetic as a cultural style that repeats itself on many levels in a particular society.9 He suggests that there is an iconicity of image and idea that is ‘naturally’ obvious to people from within the culture, and, ideally, becomes so for outside interpreters of the aesthetic (Feld 1988:93). Rice’s model adds lived experience to and removes the timelessness from the approaches of scholars like the Beckers and Feld.
