## Introduction

The time has not arrived for writing a history of Indo-Javanese literature, as much spade-work has yet to be done before one can undertake to present a comprehensive monograph on the subject from the view-point of its inner development. The number of scholars who are engaged in re-discovering its inadequately known language is so poor that the progress of research on the subject has been painfully slow. Still the magnificent labours of scholars like Raffles, Crawfurd, Winter, van Eck, Friederich, van der Tuuk, Kern, C. Stuart, Jonker, Vreede, Juynboll, Hazeu and others have brought together much valuable data, and these are being assessed by the present generation of Dutch and Indonesian scholars. We can now therefore take a tolerably synthetic view of the results thus far obtained of researches on Indo-Javanese literature and bring to one focus the labours of the past, organising at the same time a scheme of general co-operation for the future. In doing this, the first thing necessary is to bring these isolated documents together and present them in relation to the culture-history of the mainland, and this I have attempted to do in the following pages. Until recently, these studies were generally one-sided, being made from the Javanese point of view. This humble work presents, for the first time, the other side of the picture without minimising in the least Java's just share in the complex but interesting Indo-Javanese culture, or exaggerating unduly Indian influences on the same. As very few texts have been published and as the major portion of Mss. is not available outside Batavia and Leiden, I had necessarily to work in a circumscribed sphere. I therefore selected the present subject, in which there is scope for supplementing the researches of Dutch and Indonesian scholars, and have tried to advance, wherever possible, our present stock of knowledge in this particular field after an exhaustive examination of relevant records available in Dacca and Calcutta. I do not expect however that my judgment will be accepted by all without any dissentient note. A work that practically covers the literature of South-East Asia and makes an excursion into so controversial a field as Old-Javanese is bound to offer many points of attack to critics of different schools. I can only state that I have consciously blown no bubble hypothesis and have always accepted what appeared to me to be the most satisfactory explanations of facts. When they will be found to be inadequate in the light of further researches, I shall not hesitate to discard the views enunciated in this volume.

The most difficult part of my work has been to find out the chronology of Old-Javanese literature, on which the most divergent views are now held with the controversy still raging. I have tried to reconcile the apparently conflicting views of original authorities and have built up my own chronology of Old-Javanese literature after proper evaluation of the arguments of previous writers. On the basis of some synchronisms and other evidence, I have also tried to solve the most vexed problem of the Old-Javanese Ramayana and some other connected works, as on them the Old-Javanese literary chronology depends a great deal. In Chap. IV I have sought to discover a link in the charms of Indo-Mal-Polynesia and have identified some mantras with their Indian counterparts. So far only one paper has appeared in German on Indo- Javanese alankara or rhetoric. I have endeavoured, however, to throw further light on some problems of Sanskrit literature with the data derived from Indo-Javanese alarikdra. As no work has yet been written on the Medical Science of ancient Java, I have sifted the available data in this direction. In the closing portion of Chap. VI I have tried to demonstrate the currency of an unspecified era in Java, and have sought to establish the identity of Yogisvara, Rājakusuma and Kusumavicitra. While describing the later Rāmāyaṇas, I have traced one Rāmāyaṇa tradition to the early centuries of the Christian era. This has been corroborated by the art-history of Indo-China and Indonesia. The identification of reliefs in the former case is based upon les Bas-reliefs d' Angkor Vat of M. Coedès and les Bas-reliefs de Bapuon of M. Finot. I hope also that the present volume will set at rest the 30 years' old problem regarding the source of the Smaradahana. Doubts have been raised here about the accepted original sources of some Kawi-works, on which the sanction of time has lent its sanctity. I have laid some emphasis on these points just because they are no longer questioned. While in different parts of this volume I have traced particular episodes of Kawi-works to Sanskrit literature, I have not also neglected to point out their Javanese features. The latter part of the work dealing with the legends and romances of Java and Bali also opens a virgin field for investigation. These are some of the original features of the present work. Let me hope, however, that the progress of researches on Indo-Javanese literature will be so rapid as to make the present work merely a landmark to be left behind by future investigators. Perhaps it is necessary to state in this connexion that in the three grand divisions of Javanese literature, I have retained the traditional date of the fall of Majapahit, namely, 1478 A.D., (Historically speaking, this occurred about half a century later) as it coincides with the decline of Old-Javanese literature. In the treatment of the subject, however, I have found it convenient to divide it according to the distinct branches of literature, as the perusal of the following pages will show.

As regards transcription I have generally followed the practice obtaining in the J. R. A. S., though I have thought it advisable to retain Dutch methods of transcription in respect of Kawi-passages. Some diacritical marks, not being available in the Press, have been left out. In the spelling of proper names, however, tj has been substituted by c, oe by u and dj by j. V also has been generally used for w. Some discrepancies in the spelling of Pauranic names will also be noticed, but that is intentional. In describing Javanese, Malay and Balinese works, I have maintained the spellings found in the Mss., but in offering my own criticism of the same I have followed the Sanskrit authors.

No one will ever sit in severer judgment on this work than I do myself, as I am too painfully conscious of its serious shortcomings. - I hope however that some allowance will be made for a pioneer work of this kind, though I do not ask my critics to be forgetful of the errors of omission and commission which may have crept in in spite of my best efforts to the contrary. Any mistake kindly pointed out will be corrected in the next edition, if and when necessary. The work was undertaken at the suggestion of Prof. U.N. Ghoshal more than three years back and, due to various reasons, of which the distance between the author and the Press is not the least, the work took about two years to be ready for the public. During this period, some articles have appeared in the scientific journals, and my studies on Indonesian culture have also further progressed. The Ms. was therefore brought up-to-date from time to time. I hope the work, when studied along with the Additional Notes at the end of this volume, will indicate the present position of researches on Indo-Javanese literature. Owing to my intensive occupation with the work that is to follow soon, I could not devote much time to proof-reading and, though the proof-reader took all possible care in reading proofs of the latter portion of this work, some serious mistakes have still occurred. Attention is therefore invited to the list of Addenda et Corrigenda at the close of this volume. If there is any other mistake, I can only hope that this is not serious and will be readily made out by the reader himself.

I must now express my deep obligations to my Professor, Dr. R.C. Majumdar, as also to Profs. U.N. Ghoshal, S.K. Chatterji and H.D. Bhattacharya, who have taken keen interest in the publication of this humble work. I am also grateful to Dr. Ghoshal for the correction of some slips and to Prof. Bhattacharya for kindly reading Chap. III which deals with the influences of Indian Philosophy on Javanese sacred literature. I am obliged to them all for their valuable suggestions. I must also record my thanks to Mr. van Manen, General Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, for enabling me to consult the Dutch works deposited in the Society's library. The index has been kindly prepared by my friend, Mr. K.C. Ray.

## Chapter 1. Early Indo Javanese Contact And The Dialects Of The Country

The reference to Yava-dvipa in the Sanskrit Rimayana (Ramayana, 4.40.30.) probably suggests a sort of commercial relation among the Indo-Javanese peoples in the second century of the Christian era. The Indian Ramayana may roughly be dated c. 209 A.D. and the date of the work of the Alexandrine geographer Ptolemy, which mentions Iabadiu or Sabadiu, falls between 151 and 165 A. D. (7th Book, chap. 2; vide also Gerini, "Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia,"" pp. 459 ff.) It appears from these incidental references that the Indonesian world was not unknown to the Indians and foreign travellers of the early Christian era. Leaving aside the vexed question whether the Iabadiu of Ptolemy and the Ye-po-ti of the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hian refer to Java or Sumatra, it is sufficient for our purpose to know that at least one of these islands - probably both (and they enjoyed the above generic names) - had early risen to fame as a great commercial centre and emporium of the south-east seas. A little earlier, in 132 A.D., as Gabriel Ferrand says, king Devavarman (Tiau pien) sent an embassy to China. (Vide, Journal Asiatique, July-Aug., 1919, pp. 6, 14.) Though the cultural hegemony of the Indian colonists in contemporary Java can not be definitely proved from the extant materials, the Aryanised name of king Devavarman is quite significant. At any rate, it faithfully reflects the trend of the 'Zeitgeist' and the influence of early Indian colonists on prominent members of the ancient Javanese society. The title of the king is quite appropriate for a Ksatriya king. We see thus that even in the second century of the Christian era, Iabadiu or Yava-dvipa had been in direct relationship with India and China. The celebrated Javanese Nagarakrtagama (1365 A.D.), which is more of a history than a poetical composition, though too late an authority for this period, states in the second strophe of its fifteenth song that in "Samoedra-ananggoeng-bhoemi" or 144 Saka era, i.e. 222 A.D., there subsisted some sort of relations between Madura and Java. As the Javanese chronicle was composed about a millennium later and does not give even a bare outline of these inter-relations, no reliable and accurate informations can be adduced for this period of Indo-Javanese history. We tread, however, on more-solid historical ground c.400 A.D., when we come across a group of four rock-inscriptions in West Java relating to Purnavarman, who describes himself as the "lord of the town of Taruma." One of these inscriptions has been carved beautifully on a boulder lying in the river Tji Taruma, a name reminding us of the days of king Purnavarman. The verses of this famous inscription run as follows:

>Vikkrantasy = avanipateh  
Srimatah Purnnavarmanah  
Taruma nagar = endrasya  
Visnor = iva padadvayam.

As some doubtful hypotheses have been built over this Sanskrit inscription, we like to translate it in the followmg manner "Of the mighty ruler of the world, the illustrious Purnnavarman, (who is) lord of the town of Taruma, (this) pair of foot-prints comparable to Visnu's." As the inscription suggests, there is actually present a pair of foot prints on the brow of the boulder above the Sanskrit verses. The inscription has been incised in early Grantha-alphabet used in the records of the Pallava rulers (c. 30C-8CO A.D.) for Southern India. The earliest colonists of West Java were, therefore, probably immigrants from the Coromandel coast. As the river Candrabhigi has also been mentioned in one of these inscriptions, some are inclined to regard them as colonists from the Panjab region. It is difficult, however, to say what religion was professed by these early Indian colonists. It has been surmised that king Purnavarman and the colonists of the West were Vaisnavas but this generalisation is not warranted by the inscriptions at our disposal. The Taruma record merely states that the foot-prints of king Purnavarman were like unto Visnu's, and all that we can say at the present moment is that he probably subscribed to the Brahmanical faith. The set of Taruma inscriptions is certainly posterior to the Kotei Sanskrit records on the banks of the Muhakkam river (E. Borneo), which testify to the celebration of a Brahmanical sacrifice conducted by Brahmanical priests. (Dr. J. Ph. Vogel, Bijdragen T. L. VK., LXXIV, pp. 162-232.) But we cannot assume on grounds of that priority that the Indians had settled in East Borneo before they actually colonised the Western parts of Java. If both these coloni ations were effected through maritime enterprise, it is probable that the colonists from India would first land in West Java and then try to colonise the regions of Borneo. (I am indebted to Prof. R.C. Majumdar, M.A., Ph.D., for this suggestion.) If, on the other hand, they traversed the territories of South-east Asia through Burma, Siam, Campa, Cambodia etc., embarking only from the point above Borneo, they might have colonised it prior to their settlement of W. Java. At any rate, the materials at our disposal do not throw sufficient light on this disputed point. It is significant, however, that the kings of E. Borneo, W. Java and the Coromandel coast use the Varman title appropriate for Ksatriya kings. Shortly afterwards, the Chinese pilgrim Fa-hian, who was going to China from Ceylon, was caught in a hurricane in the South-east seas and was driven to a country called Ye-po-ti - which might be Java or Sumatra - in 414 AD. He says that in this country the heretics and the Brahmanas flourish, but the laws of Lord Buddha are not much known. According to a Chinese tradition, Gunavarman was responsible for the introduction of Buddhism into Java in 431 A.D. It is quite probable, however, that the incident merely records and represents a fresh influx of Buddhism into Java and does not necessamiily testify to this first introduction of Buddhism into this country. Other isolated attempts might have been made previously to spread the gospel of the Northern church, but a "conspiracy of silence" in historical records does not allow us to make further observations on this point. On some evidences which we have gathered elsewhere, it is permissible to think that the peoples of Gujrat probably came to Java during this period, and brought along with them Saivism and the system of year-computation, which, in Java, started from the year 456 A.D. This hypothesis is further corroborated by the fact that the next inscription we come across has been dated in the Saka year 654, while that of Purnavarman does not offer the date of its composition. This Canggal in-cription of king Sanjaya (654 Saka year), written in Sanskrit and in a later form of the script used in W. Java, records the consecration of a holy linga in middle Java. According to Dr. Kern, the king's ancestors belonged to Kunjarakunja in Southern India. (Dr. R.C. Majumdar, M.A., Ph.D., drew my attention to the remark of Prof. N.J. Krom that the inscription does not support the conclusion of Dr. Kern, which is rather far-fetched. Vide Krom's discussion in Inleiding, vol. I, p. 99.) Though some scholars think that the inscription represents the inrush of the West-Javanese colonists towards middle Java, others are inclined to believe that there was a fresh influx of Indian colonists in Middle-Java during this period from the Kalinga region. While it would be unprofitable to enter into this controversial question on account of the paucity of reliable data, it can be pointed out that many legends and traditions of Java recognise the steady influx of colonists from the Gujrat region, "The superiority of their number was probably responsible for the ultimate imposition of the Saka system of year computation in Javanese inscriptions. These years between 654 and 682 (Saka year) represent the greatest activity on the part of the earliest Saiva colonists. In the latter year, the inscription of Dinaja records in lucid Sanskrit verses the erection of an image of sage Agastya, who is regarded as the first missionary responsible for introducing Hindu civilization in the region beyond the Vindhyas. (Prof. D.R. Bhandarkar, Carmichael Lectures for Feb. 1918, Lect. I.) As we shall see later on, he has also been referred to in the celebrated Mahayanist work of Java, the Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan and in other works of the classical period, The oldest Kawi-record as also the earliest Buddhist inscription of Java, written in the Nagari script of the north, is the famous inscription of the illustrious Sailendra dynasty, which conformed to the Buddhist religion of the Mahayanist school. This important record of c. 778 A.D. was simultaneously edited by Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar (J. B.-Br. R.A.S., vol. XVII, pt. II, (no. XLVII).) and Dr. J.L.A. Brandes. (Tijdschrift V. I. T. L. Vk., deel XXXI (1886), pp. 240-260.) The inscription records the dedication of a temple to the Buddhist goddess Tara together with a dwelling-place for the high-souled Bhiksus, who knew the Vinaya and the Mahayana. The local governor, who built it at the request of the Sailendra king, calls himself " Kariyanapanankaranah". These Sailendra rulers of Srivijaya, whose centre was Palembang, play a dominant role in the political and cultural history of Indonesia from the 8th century of the Christian era. According to Dr. Stutterheim, however, the supremacy of the Sailendra dynasty merely represents a Javanese period of Sumatran history. These Sailendra rulers were Mahayanist Buddhists and they tried, like Asoka, to spread the religion of Lord Buddha in the zone of their commercial and political activities. Students of Indian history are quite familiar with the services rendered by the illustrious Balaputradeva of Suvarnadvipa, donor of a monastery at Nalanda during the reign of Devapaladeva of the Pala dynasty of Bengal. (Ep. Ind., vol. XVII, pp. 310 ff.) He also belonged to this celebrated line of Buddhist rulers, Some epigraphists are of opinion that the oldest Kawi-forms agree with the alphabets of the Girnar inscription. Another "ornament of the Sailendra dynasty", at the request of his spiritual preceptor, erected the image of Bodhisattva Mansjuri or Maujughosa; which has been referred to in the much-damaged inscription of 782 A.D., discovered at Kelurak. The Indo-Javanese artists of this century also began to build marvellous architectural structures, and the scribblings for the direction of masons at the reliefs on the basement of Borobodur, according to Prof. N. J. Krom, may, on paleographical grounds, be dated in the second half of the 8th century A.D. Temples of the Dyeng plateau and of the Prambanan-group were also contemporaneous with the Borobodur stupa; at any rate, they are certainly not later than the 9th century A.D. We shall not be far wrong probably if we accept 750-900 A.D. as the golden age of Indo-Javanese art. Mach valuable contribution has thus been made to the cultural history of middle Java during this epoch of Indo-Javanese relations.

It seems probable to us that the Buddhism 'of this time came from East Bengal, where the Khadgas, (Vide Ashrafpur copper-plate grant of Devakhadga, Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. I, No. 6, pp. 85-91. The dynasty: probably ruled in the 7th century A.D. with Kamta near Comilia as capital.) Candras, (Vide Ep. Ind., vol. XII, No. 18; Ibid., vol. XVII; they were: contemporaneous with the later Palas.) and other Buddhist dynasties ruled and where the Pala Emperors first rise into importance. (Cf. the Sloka, sakrah purodisi putir=nag dig=antaresu Tar=api daitya-putibhir=jitu= eva [sadyah] Dharma krtas=tad=adhipas=to =akhilasu dik su Svami may=eti vijahasa Brhaspatim yah" Badal inscription.) In ancient times it was also known as Harikela: "Vangas=tu Harike liya Angas=Camp=opalaksitah." Towards the close of the 7th century AD., I-tsing the Chinese pilgrim lived here for about a year, (Vide Jyan Takakusu's I-tsing, p. XLVI.) as it was a great centre of Buddhist culture. The celebrated Buddhist pilgrim Hiuen Tsang also learnt Buddhism and Yoga from Silabhadra, a prince of Samatata, which might be South or East Bengal. It appears from a reference of Kalidasa, (Vide Raghuvamniam, 4th Sarga.) from the use of "Samwudrasrayin" in the Hadaha inscription� and from other original sources that the Bengalees of those days were also great navigators. An inscription of the Buddhist sea-captain Mahanavika Budhagupta of Raktamrttika (mod. Rangamiti in Mursidabad) has been discovered in the Wellesley district of the Malay peninsula, The Kelurak inscription, which we have described previously, also refers to Rajaguru, who came from Gaudadvipa (Bengal) to Java with a view to 'purify with the holy dust of his feet' the Sailendra ruler of central Java, who consecrated the image of Manjusri. Professor Coedès has already shown us from an old Malay inscription of Srivijaya (684 A.D.) that the Vajrayana was known to Sumatra at that early period. When we 'bring this scattered information together, it seems to indicate that the Mahayina and the Tantrayiana cults of Java really penetrated from Bengal, probably East Bengal, the centre of Buddhism in E. India. Indeed, the very name of Borobodur seems to have been derived from the Bengali Buddhists, who used the term 'Vadar' as a corruption of Vajra, signifying a title of Lord Buddha.

From the second half of the 9th century A.D., the centre of political gravity gradually shifts to East Java, where we notice a great Saivite revival in 863 A.D. Itis very probably due to the influence of the great Vediantist philosopher Sankaracarya, who led a crusade in 8th century A.D. against the Buddhists of the mainland. The Indo-Javanese literature of the earliest period represents a tremendous influence of Saivism, which began to modify the philosophy of the Mahavianist Buddhists. This tincture of Saivism in the early literature of the Javanese peoples is the after effect of aggressive Hinduism of the school of the great Vedantist philosopher Sankaricirya. - The Rimiyane of Yogi�vara, the B/Auvanakoga, the Bhuvanasamiksgepa, to �quote only a few names out of many, may serve to illustrate 'the point, The full East-Javanese period, however, begins with Sindok of Medang, whose influence became predominant in the second quarter of the 10th century A.D. He be~longed to the I�@ina dynasty of Java, which, according to our theory, was replaced by that of Dharmmavamfifa in 947 AD. Anantavikrama, a scion of the latter dynasty, -who was ruling towards the close of the toth century a.D., gave his daughter in marriage to Airlangga, one of the most enlightened rulers of ancient Java, During his eign in the beginning of the century A.D., there was vigorous activity in the domain of art and literature,

and some of the best Kawi-works belong to this period.
'Many important works were also composed in the reigns of Jayavarga, Jayabhaya, Hayam Wuruk and other distinguished rulers of Java, as we shall see later on,.

Though kings and kingdoms have fallen together, 'the literary activity of the peoples has never suffsred greatly.
With the change of the political centre from - Kediri, Tumapel or Singhasari, to Majapahit-the literary activity has only changed places After the fall of Majapahit in about 1478 A.D., literature takes a newer form and it generally goes by the name of Middle-Javanese,. This style of literature persists up to c. 1628 a.D., when it makes room for the Javanese of our own days,. It must not be imagined, however, that this division of literary epochs is absolute-it merely represents a rough classification of literary ideals and styles in thres distinct diversified forms.s Indonesian: literature of the M'ddle-Javanese and New Javanese periods has been greatly influenced by the penetration of Islamic ideals and they have been responsible for creating a hybrid composition of a very peculiar typem�ad'�m, Suleiman, Mahammad, Hamza have appeared along with 'the heroes of the Ramayana and the Mahabhirate. Txcepting probably the Pafji-cycle of stories: in the MiddleJavane�e and the celebrated Balinese Megantaka, no work of subsequent date can stand - comparison with the works of the classical period .of Indo-Javanese literature.
efore we proceed, however, with these works, it would be better to have some idea of Indonesian dialects and languages, which we shall refer to sometimes in course of our study.

"The Indonesian linguistics", says Blagden,' "constitute the Western division of the great Austronesian (or Mal Polynesian or Oceanic) fam ly. of speech, which extends

over a vast portion of the earth's surface...... Though but a small part of its area 'falls on the mainland of Asia, there is no reasonable doubt that it is of genuinely Asiatic origin, and of late years, it has been - linked up with another Asiatic family, which includes a number of languages of India and Indo-China e.g. Munda, Khast; Mon-Khmer, etc." Apart from this linguistic affinity in the group of Indo-Mal-Polynesian peoples, there is yet a cultural re'ationship in the domain of art, religion, science and literature-which can be the proper theme of sc entific study, and in the present volume we propose to devote our main attention to the literature of these interesting peoples.

/ Among the languages of - Indonesia, Sundanese;

__ Madurese and Javanese have an important literature of their own, - Sundanese was spoken by - the mountaineers - of the Western - districts of Java before the in-coming of Islam,. It is probably the olde�t dialect of Western Java, A large number of Malay words have found place in the Sundanese vocabulary and some Sanskrit terms used in connexion with art, science,.
and polity are to be noticed therein,. The Madurese, however, is distinctly a different dialect from - Sundanese, though some words from the latter have penetrated into the former. It has further been enriched by an influx of Malay words. This dialect can be sub-divided into two branches, viz. the dialect of Madura proper and that of Sumenap. They are, however, more akin to Mulayese.
and Sundanese than to- Javanese, which has the most interesting literature in the Archipelago. The Balinese dialect, which possesses a valuable Literature like that of the Javanese, does not, however, betray close relation to the Javanese. Indeed, Dr. Van der Tuuk says,* "Only a.

few words are identical in both languages, while many others. have in each case more or less different forms". :

The Javanese, which is the language east of Cheribo?, 'has a very interesting history, The old-Javanese is a'so called Kaw: and the works in Kawz-poesie are, called Kakawin, Its history ranges at least from the time of the Kalasan inscription of the Sailend ra dynasty of Palembang to the fall of Majapahit c. 1478 A.D. Tins is the classical period of Javanese literature and the be t: works of this epoch have defied the ravages of time., The Midd! e�javanese makes room for New Javanese in about 1628 A.D.�(15'50 'Saka year), and gradually divides itself into several subdivisions e.g. Krama, Madya (Madhya), Ngoko, B�sa Kedatan and Krama Inggil.

Krama is the polite language and is sometimes used d by the aristocrats when speaking to equals. To speak Krama therefore, to an inferior or an equal, is a mark of respect. When addressing an inferior, the aristocrat uses tfhc Ngoko, which is the language of the commoners. Similarly, the commoners use the dialect of the aristocrats the Krama-while addressing their superiors. As a matter of fact, the peoples are, therefore, compelled to learn both "the Ngoko as well as the Krama, And 1 the children of the country, though they general y speak and think in Ngoko, become accustomed to both these forms of speech from "their early . life and this habit is further enhanced by their training in the Dafanima, which is a table for synonyms, and which they cannot escape learning. A list of Dafanama, which we have discussed elsewhere, will readily account for the richness of the dialect with its minute distinctions and different ahades of meaning. - Between Ngoko and Krama, there is a sort of compromise dialect, which goes by the name of Madya, The Madya is generally used by the aristocrats while speaking amongst themselves, the Krama being occasionally used. This �coimpromise-dialect is. a hybrid . mixture of Ngoko and~>

14 INDO-JAVANESE CONTACT AND DIALECTS >>

Krama words. Thenk?ov?ed�g� of these three off shoots of the New-Javanese is a necessity which an ordinary Javanese cannot avert. The Ngoko and: the Krama contain some Sanskrit words and it bas been proved conclusively by the recent researches of Dutch Scholars that about 40 Sanscrit words more than those in Ngoko are to be met with in the polite tongue i.e. the Krama. There are, however, some Sanskrit words in Ngoko which are not to be met with inthe Krama. The Krama Inggil, to which we have previously, referred contains a vocabulary of about 300 words.
and this dialect is used in addressing gods and the aristocrats of the country. Viewed from the standpoint of: commoners, the Krama Inggil, therefore, besides being.
employed for addressing the superiors, has the additional: function of being used as a vehicle for addressing the gods of the country. The Basa Kedatan, however, is of artificial growth and is primarily considered as acourt-language,� which is used by all living in the courts, As the persons: of the blood royal are in the highest rung of the ladder, they address others-who are presumably of lower rank-in.
Ngoko.- The women of the court, however, while speaking: amongst themselves, use the polite tongue or the compromise-dialect ie, either Krama or Madya. If they be in.
the necessity of addressing men, they would use the Basa: Kedatan, which is the general court-language.
The Sanskrit words that have entered into the Kaw language have been greatly corrupted, Dr. Friederich

pointed out long ago that 'wa' has been changed to '0," 'ya' to 'e' and much confusion has cropped up between 'a"

and 'o} 'P' and 'e' and 'w' and 'b'. For example, Sanskrit Vyasa, Valmiki, Varuna etc, become in Kawi Byasa,; Balmiki, Baruna, etc. Besides, we notice again the custom

that has obtained among the Kawi-writers of, dropping.
some Sanskrit prefixes, which make it extremely difficult to recognise the original Sanskrit word. For example, we get 'nugraha' in the place of Sanskrit 'anugraba' and so forth..
The custom is also prevalent among the Malay peoples..
To take some instances, the Sanskrit 'Avatara' has been transformed into Malay 'Vitara', the Javanese (Moon) has been changed into 'Bulan' and so forth.* Some: times we find that owing to the requirements of prosody or versification, many words and - syllables-which are absolutely necessary for yielding a complete sense-are omitted ; sometimes, again, many unnecessary words and .
syllables are over-burdened on the construction, which, however, is simple and regular, The nouns, as in the Malay, possess no distinction of number, gender and case. .
The number is denoted by separate words,expressive of plu- rality or singularity. In the Sanskrit, we have kartpka@raka,..
karma-ka@raka etc ; but the Javanese has no corresponding : cases,. Adjectives, which follow the noun, are indeclinable, .
When a necessity is felt for comparing an object, it is : generally done by prefixing a word, which means higher or lower, or by the addition of some adverbs, The superlative degree is expressed by adverbs, meaning "very, exceeding.
ly etc." It would appear from this general survey that the construction of sentences does not follow the Sanskrit-it .

In the present state of our knowledge, it is difficult to say how far this is based on facts At any rate, we cannot ignore the : fact that the order of alphabets in Devanagari has 1 J.

also been imitated in,. the Sumatran and Celebes alphabets, The order is different in Javanese, though it appears that the Indian arrangement was not unknown to the Javanese peoples, On account of this different system, some scholars are inclined to believe that these Afksaras were introduced in Java at a time, when the -order in India itself was not fixed at all. The decimal system of notation, however, is a conspicuous gilt of the Andian peoples, for which the world will ever be indebted 'to the Hindus., With these preliminary remarks on the cultural contact of the two most interesting peoples of . South-east Asia, we pass on to our study of literature proper -~-which is the main theme of this work. In the conclud-ing chapter of this book we shall have occasion to pause for a moment over the consequent results of Indo-Javanese contact and gauge the depth of Indian cultural influence on the lives and ideals of the Javanese and the Balinese peoples. At present let us see what India contributed to the literature of these interesting peoples and how far

their literature. was developed and modified through the curious commingling of literary ideals of these two types

of peoples-the Indo-Aryan and the Austronesian families ~of the human race,



CHAPTER IL

SACRED LITERATURE-(A) THE VEDAS AND (B) THE BRAHMANDAPURANA

In Java and Bali, thers are many books on theology, which are directly or indirectly connected with the sacred literature of India, - Besides the so-called Vedas-which do mot exist at the present moment-we have the Brakmamdapurina, Bhuvanakosa, Bhuvanasamksepa, Tattvae Sang Eyang - - Byhaspati - Tattva, Bang - Hyang Kamahayanikaen-which rank foremost in popular estimation. Par? passu, we have legions of Saiva, Vaigqava and Buddhist mantras or charins, many of which have undoubtedly - been borrowed from India, _ Paiticularly the occurrence of the second verse of the Gayatri mantra in the Suryasevana-a mantra, which the Brihmanas would never impart to non-Hindus-is a positive proof that this mantra, at any rate, was brought over by the Brahmana colonists of Iridiagfzfjfll these books are written partly in Sanskrit and partly in old-] avanese', and, therefore, a study of these works from the view-point of India's contribution is an object of scientific curiosity. As the early Indian colonists of Java never intended to commit spiritual suicide, it was a foregone conclu-~ion that a rich IndoJavanese literature of a religious character would develop there under peculiar circumstances. And that is what has actually happened there, y�fl�he Indian colonists of Java

1 J. L, A. Brandes wrote in the 'aanteckeningen' on the Ist chapter of the Pararaton that Lohgawe (Riaghava?), contemporary of Ken Angrok (11040969 Saka), is the first Brahmana of Java. ; In view of a long-standing Indo-Javanese contact onwards from the second century of the Christian era, it is really to be wondered why the Brihmana� should come only in the reign of Ken Angrok, and not �earlier. Cf. Fahian's statement, mentioned in the first chapter. _

not only brought their forms and rituals of worship but also their religious literature, which is the very foundation: of their life. That is the reason probably why the largest: number of books of Indian origin in Java 'and Bali are of a religious character-always the secular tone has been subordinated to theological considerations even in the few secular works that we do possess.

_ A we classify, again, the old-Javanese writers of the: so-called Vedic literature of Indonesia, we are agreeably surprised to find that the largest number of writers come from the sects of the Saivas and the Buddhists, and least from the Vaisnavas, Though the earliest colonists of West Java were probably Brahmanical Hindus* from Sou� thern India-as is suggested by the so-called Vengi-script of c. 400 a,. p -they seem to have been submerged under the waves of newer Saiva colonists, whom we see established in Middle Java at a later date. We do not know if these early colonists of West Java contributed anything towards the development of the ancient Javanese literature. Leaving aside the Kalasan inscription of c. 778 a. D., which is the first Zawi-record extant of Java, literature proper, as we understand by the term, does not take its start before the roth century a. D. Is it not curious, that within 6 centurxes of Hindu influence in Java ranging at least from the 4th to the 10th, they contributed nothing towards the development of the literature of the country ? % ?% The: problem seriously sets us a-thinking. This state of affairs, we think, was due to various reasons and of them, the first place: must be assigned to the struggle of languagesIndian as well as Javanese. Nothmfr sort of a miracle: can change or transform the language of a country within an appreciably short time and, as the earliest Indian colonists of Java were not of sufficient numbers, the

experiment must have been protracted for a long time. It is very probable that the native dialects of Java persi-tently opposed the intrusion of the Sanskrit language, which, however, on account of its polish and richness, began to make steady progress. - The strength of Sanskrit was further augmented by the influx of fresh colonists from India ; the Javanese peoples as well during these centuries of contact began to appreciate the melody and rhythm of Sanskrit, which was capable of expressing the most subtle ideas in the most exquisite forms.
� l his compromise in the field of language created the wonderful but artificial in which majority of words are Sanskritic and least Javanese. This struggle of two languages-Indo-Aryan and - Austronesian-probably retarded the spontaneous growth of literature for a considerable time till the development of the artificial compromiselanguage created a new field for literary enterprise, As Sanskrit and Javanese would not be understood by the earliest Indo-Javanese society, necessity was felt for the creation of a language of the type ofb/gggw�, which, while retaining the forms of the oldest Javanese construction, would bear the spirit of a more refined language. Kaew: language is, therefore, in some respects the continuation of the classical literature of ancient India.

, Ihe oldest as stated previously, is the celebrated Kalasan inscription of c. 778 A.D. The oldest dialect of Java which was merely marking time before the eighth century A. D., now begins to develop rapidly in a newer form. , In the annals of the Indo-Javanese literature, the Kalasan inscription, therefore, not only represents the synthesis of two cultural ideals but also tends to give a start to literature proper,. - According to some scholars, certain books written in old-Javanese or Zaew;: may be assigned to the Sth and oth centuries of the Christian era.
31: we accept this conjecture, we can provisionally accept 778 AD. as the starting point of the Javanese literature,

20 VEDAS AND BRAHMAyPAPURAXA

though definite proof of it cannot be obtained before the it�th century a.v,. As the rich Sanskrit language was its hand-maid, there is no wonder that the Zew#-literature suddenly bursts forth in full glory even in its infancy.

; It may be argued again that the Indo-Javanese literature

prior to the tenth century A. D. may have met the same fate

which awaited the pre-Kautiliya Artbha�astras.*t - It is quite natural that if some works of outstanding merit are written on a particular topic, the earlier ones are gradually overshadowed by those newer in the field and become extinct in due course. - The difficulties in the way of our accepting this hypothesis lie in the fact that the oldest Java ese vehicle does not appear to b: strong enough to carry the burden of rich imageries and subtle ideas with their abstruse shades

and meanings, as were introduced by the oldest colonists of ancient India. - Indeed, it requires robust faith to believe in the possibilities of a literature that has left behind no vestige for the pre-Kalasan period. , ?upposing, but not admitting, that there was an indigenous literature before the eighth century A.D. which has followed the suit of the pre- Kautiliya Arthafgistras, what guarantee is there that every work of this poriod would be covered by some outstanding compositions of the post-Sindok period of IndoJavanese history and become extinct as a result thereof ?
If there was any literature before the eighth century A, D., its disappearance has to be traced to a different reason ; besause, no literature, however rich, can cover every subject of the previous authors. - P9 the ninth century, however, Indian cultural influence definitely predotninated over the Javanese, and the Saivite revival of 863 A.D. gave it a further impetus, which is clearly discernible in the Rama-reliefs of the Primbinin-group. 'I'he 122 years intervening between 778-900 &. D,. may, therefore, be regarded as a transitional

period. - The language used in the Kalasan inscription was thus improved by writers of the Ioth century A. D., who adopted it for their literature and gave it a final form.
Towards the beginning of the Iith century A. D.,

Va1smv1am seems to have made some headway in West Java, and Vaignava literature flourished under king Tjitjatih, probably himself a Vaigsnava by faith. .. records belonging to the middle of the 1Iith century A. D. also betray a strong Vaigsqavite tinge. If we, however, take a general view of the Indo-Javanese literature, it appears that the majority of writers are either Buddhists or Saivas and few Vaisnavas. This fact indicates the unique position of the Saivas and the Buddhists in the peculiarly-constituted Indo Javanese society.

. With the Balinese peoples, however, everything is blank and no record can be dated before 818 Saka year or 896 AD.* The majority of their wi:iitings are either adaptations or borrowings from the Indo-Javanese classical literature, and in this way the interlinear translation of the Ramayana, the Bairatayuddha kidung, the Ruma kidung, etc., have continued in Bali. _ There are some excellent works of indigenous origin, but as they do not come within our purview, we do not consider them for our present purpose .1 It is a matter of congratulation, however, that much of the Indo Javanese literature has been - able to escape the terrible fate of the Buddhist libraries of VikramaSilia and Uddandapura, which were totally destroyed by the Muslim conquerors. As the Eastern Roman Empire preserved the vestiges of the Greco-Roman culture in Constantinople, or as Nepal preserved the heritage of the twelfth-century Bauddha-monks of Bengal, so also the little island of Bali was able to sustain the classical literature of Java, whose loss would have undoubtedly diminished much of our interest in the Indo-Javanese cultural history, Though our knowledge

of the earliest phase of the Indo-Balinese literature is not sufficiently clear, it may be stated in general that most of the Indian works that have penetrated into the island of Java have also retained their hold in the literary circles of Bali, ~*" The question now naturally arises why the creators of the Indo-Javanese literature wrote partly in Sanskrit and rarely in Prikrt or Pali? Why is it a fact that even the Buddhist writers did not shun Sanskrit in favour of canonical Pali, which was the sacred vehicle of their religious literature ?
From the time of Lord Buddha right up to the time of the Gupta supremacy, Pali was enjoying an unparalle.ed reputation in the land of its origin and it would be quite natural, therefore, to suppose that the Indian Buddhist emigrants in Java would try to leave an impress of their literature [ on the Kawi? literature of Indonesia, and this would perhaps have been - the logical outcome. Jlt was a pure accident, however, that the earliest Indian colonists of Java were Brihmanical Hindus and they had settled, as far as we know at the present moment, before the arrival of the | Buddbist immigrants. �This influx of the Brahmanical ' Hindus, besides other contributing factors, necessarily had a greater influence on the history of Kaw? literature, which, in its earliest stages began to be moulded by the penples that came earder, w?�sides, the current of Sanskrit literature, which was re-invigorated in the postVedicperiod by many works on philosophy and religion, received a tremendous stimulus from the prolific contributions of Bhiasa, Afvaghosa, Kalidasa and other writers of the pos:~Mauryan period. In the place of what is called Monumental Priky? by Senart, Sanskrit inscriptions gradually, came to hold the ground from the second century -BC. till we come to the age of elaborate Sanskrit Prafasiis of the type of Harigeqa's Allahabad inscription. Now, when these Brahmanical colonists land: d as the : torch- bearers of Indian civilisation in this outlying frontier

India of and became the vanguard of succeeding Indian influxes-Hindua and Buddhistic-they naturally brought along with them the legacy of this Sanskrit literature, which, enriched by the writings of contemporary Sanskrit authors, was stirring the imaginations of the Indian world.
Notwithstanding the past grandeur of Pali, it could not make any headway in this "island-empire" for want of zealous protagonists, who could stem back the tide of Sanskrit influence. Asjokan inscriptions do not mention 'the despatch of any Buddhist missionary for the propaga'tion of Buddhism in Java and, when the Bhiksus came at all, their language and literature were on the general decline 'in the mainland. Whether we admit or not the proposition of Mahamahopadhyaya Pagdit Haraprasid Sastri that the Maurya empire collapsed as a result of Brahmanical reaction, the facts remain that after the break-down of the .Mauryan political machinery, Brahmanical influence gradually becomes predominant in the main theatres of Indian history. - The rule of the Kiuvas, Sungas, Andhrabhrtyas, Vakatakas and even of the Western satraps really reflects the spirit of - Neo-Hinduism, which, with its -elaborate rituals and ceremonials offered a counterblast to Mahayanist Buddhism. The final verdict on this point was given in the fourth century A.D., when the powerful patronage of the Imperial Gupta monarchs brought Hinduism on a par with Afsokan Buddhism, which, notwithstanding the official support of the Kugsina monarchs began to decline for the time being. $5, when - the :Buddhist preachers of the Mahiayanist school began to pour into these groups of islands, they had no .poweiful state-support behind them, and they noticed with some. chagrin after their arrival in Java that the Brahmapical colonists (may be Saivas or Vaignavas) of the South, and the Saiva colonists of Western India were comfortably

lodged in West and Middle;Java and Sanskrit had made

some progress as a vehicle of literature.* . The citadel of Sanskrit might still have been stormed if the Buddhists came in sufficient numbers, which they never did. When the Chinese pilgrim Fahian visited Java in the beginning of the 5th century a.D., the Buddhists were very few in the island and their influence counted all too little, , And hence, there is no wonder, that when the question of writing the Kalasan inscription cropped up, modified Sans krit or Kaw? was adopted as the vehicle of expression and Nagari became the script. It practisally decided the virtual predominance of Sanskrit, which henceforward began to develop under the triple auspices of the Brahmanical - Hindus, Buddhists and the Javanese.
Outside the literary sphere, they also began to develop a composite compromise-religion, a rough grasp of which is necessary for a proper under-tanding of the literature of Java and Bali, which is replete with modified theories of: Brahmanical and Buddhistic philoso} hy.

The close relation that subsisted between these twoimportant communities of Java and Bali had naturally exerted some coordinate influence on contemporary literature and society.\2:1 fact, a study of the ancient IndoJavanese literature would clearly demonstrate how Saiv� ism gradually came into the limelight and Buddhism.
receded to the back-ground. . A sort of compromire in religion was the outcome of this inter-relatio: ship ; but evidently, the Indo-Javanese community of the Buddhists and the Hindus more compromised their religious views than their bretliren in Pala Bengal. Pala-insciiptions never identify Buddha with Lord Siva nor do they recognise the former as the younger brother of the latter, though, by the time of Ksemendra of Kagmir (11th century A.D.} and Jayadeva of, Bengal '(12th century A.D.), Buddha.

1 Cf, the language of incriptions dated before 778 A.D..

CH. II ] VEDAS AND BRAHMANDAPURAINA 25

was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon as an tion of Visnu. This compromise in religion is demonstrated in the festiviti�s of Bali, in the literature and inscriptions _| of Java. .An avowed Mantrayanist work of great impor�??�Wf tance-the Seng Hyang Kamahayanikan-was not even free from Saiva tinge. It appears thus that there was going on a strenuous effort to merge the two god-heads-Siva and" Buddha-into one. In the Simpang-stone inscription of Airlangga (Saka 956=1034 AD), we come across thephrasem��az'wz Sogata rg?"; in the Calcutta-stone inscrip~tion of the same king, dated 965 Saka=1043 A.D., we find the expression, - "Nogate Mahke�vare - Mahabrakmana"..
Again, the Singsari inscription of 1273 Saka era (1351 A.D.} states, "Mfahibdrihmin@ Seva Sogata"* This is not only evident in inscriptions, but also in literature. The Niagara Artagama says,2 "God Buddha differs not from Siva, theuppermost of gods.........they are different and they are one !" The term 'Weive-Budadhka', has also been used in.
song 40 of the above work. In the lontar-Ms. of Sang: Eyang Kamahaiyanikan (Cod. 5068 of the Lombok collec: tion), we come across on fol. 22 the expression, "Bud@/Ze: tunggal lawan iva" i.e. Buddha is one with Lord:!
Siva.} In fact, Buddha has been regarded in Indonesia as the youngest brother of Siva. It is interesting tonote that the peoples of Java and Bali do not worship there the Buddhistic Siva but rather the Saivistic Buddha..
We have got there "Siva-Buddha@layas", i.e., temples of Siva-Buddha. & This prominent factor has tinctured the sacred literature of Indonesia, So there is no wonder if we notice that the Javanese Buddhist authors have written stories in

Kawilanguage, which are borrowed not from the or the legends of Buddha, but from the great epic stories of India. The difference, however, between the Buddhist Vajrayanism, which is a later off-shoot of the Mantrayanist school, and the Brahmanical Tantricism does not appear to be quite clear. The nihilistic 'Sunyata' and Nirvana' are present in both the Saiva and the Buddhistic writings, and we do not possess sufficient materials to bring ; out clearly how far they are based upon the Simkhya philosophy, the Vedanta and the teachings of the Madhyamika school. Whatever diffeence there might have been during the ninth and the tenth centuries of the Christian era between Vajrayanism and Brahmanical Tantricism, we find that their main ideological differences were fast disappearing by the middle of the eleventh century and, that is due to the development of the Siva-Buddha cult.!
The un-Buddhistic opening of the book Migarakr/zgama, which was composed in 1365 A.D., explains this or Voidness in such a way that the metaphysical theories of the Mantrayina and the Brahmanical Vedanta

or salvation. This is the pervading note of a large number

theological works of Indonesia and, therefore, it is absolutely necessary to have some idea of it at the very outset, though we shall discuss the subject more fully later on. With these preliminary remarks, we now pass on to our subject proper, viz.-the 'Vedas of Indonesia'.

The phrases, 'Vedas of Indonesia' and the 'Vedic literature" have sometimes been used by foreign scholars, though it is probably a misnomer to call them as such.. Fhe Vedas, as we understand by the term, do not exist in Java and Bali mor is there any proof that they did ever exist.: Only the names of the Vedas appear to be quite familiar with

the Javanese and the Balinese priests, who cannot, how.
ever, offer any substantial information on this point. Still, we have sometimes used these phrases, because they exactly translate the spirit of a section of the Indo-Javanese and the Indo-Balinese literature, which we are going to discuss now.
-_ Dr, Friederich mentioned the names of the four Vedas as (1) the R�g Veda, (2) the Jadjoer Veda, (3) the Lama Veda and (1) the Artawa Veda, and conjectured that they travelled into the island of Bali from Kediri and Majapahit.} As the Vedas, however, do not exist and as we do not know what they contained even if they existed at all, it is very difficult for us to assess the value of the hypothesis of Dr. Friederich. Further, the Balinese priests use the words 'Veda' and 'Caturveda', but what was exactly connoted by them during the Indo-Javanese period, it is very difficult to sayxgi. Goris says?, "The fact that by Veda the Balinese peoples understood only charms and nothing else, is no guessing ; it appears from the 'Vivikae', where gudrea-mantras -or charms have been translated in the Balinese recension

Sama, which contained only 4 stoiras,' e.g., (1) the Dravya.

appears to be the genealogical part of the work, If at all.
these Indian Vedas came to Indonesia, they are long lost beyond our hopes of recovery.. Beyond these statements, we cannot say anything more at the present state of our knowledge. We now go on to discuss the Balinese recension of the Indian BraZmindapurina, which was first discussed� and analysed by Dr. Friederich as early as 1849,

3 cults of Brahmi, Visgu and MaheSvara. In Indonesia, however, we come across only one Purana and that is the.

of Bali also states that the world was created from 'Andae' or egg by the penances of Brahma. The author of "the Balinese recension then mentions the story of the creation of the four sons of Brahmi, but he gives the names of two sons only, to wit, (1) Sunanda and Sanatkumara, Dr,. H. N. Van der Tuuk,'* however, referred to a second Ms., which seems to be fuller than the one used by Dr. Friederich. <~Because, it not only gives the name of the third son (minasa-putra) as Sanaka, but also gives us some additional informations. The name Sunanda of Friederich's Ms. has been changed into Enanda in the Ms. of V. d. _ Tuuk. The Indian - recension?
gives in one place only three names, e.g. Sanandana, Sanaka and Sanitana and in another place* 4, e.g. Sananda, Sanaka, Sanitana, and Sanatkumi@ra. It is probably this list, which has been referred to in the Balinese recension.
The Ms. of Dr. Van der Tuuk further introduces us at the very beginning to a king called Dasamakrsoa or Difimakrsoat and to the two Bhagavinas, Romaharsaga and Nemigeya," who were interrogated by the king to relate the '(Manuvam�akrama' - Alter this, follows a lengthy description of the creation and the birth of the four mianasa'putras : "Agre sasarjjya bhagavin manasin aimanah saman." Then follows a tedious description of the origin of time and space, as we find in the Indian recension. Brahmas then proceeded to create the nine Devaorsgtis, eg.

tion of this chaos, we find an account of the four viz., Brahmiacari, Grhasta, Wek@nasa (or Vanaprastha) and Yati.

,j Some Indian scholars have thought that the date of the Balinese Brahmindapurina is c. 500 A.D. It ought to be clearly understood that the earliest reference to the Bal, recension occurs in the old-Javanese Adiparvan,* which was probably composed in the century A.D. All that we can say at the present moment is that it existed in the 10th century AD., and to push back the date to the 5th century A.D. would be rather premature. It had also a Kakawin recension of 18 songs.

g j There are reasons to believe that, besides the Byahmandapurainam, the Indian Vignupuzrinam was also present in Java and Bali in the Indo-Javanese period.
This appears to us to be due to the fact that the story of Vena and Nisgada's birth as given in the Pisnupurinam does not materially differ from the account of the Balinese. recension of the Indian BreZAmindaepzrinem.
Besides, the accounts of the Kakawin Kalsyavaninrtaka seemto have been borrowed from the Visnupurinam ; some reliefs at Candi Jago also tally with the accounts of the same work.
Sometimes, the genealogical portions of the Javanese.
Adiparva tally with the lists of the Indian Vzisnupurinem, and not with similar portions of the Indian Adiparvan, as Dr,. Hazeu points out." These reasons confirm our; suspicion that the book was once present in Indonesia, and has subsequently been lost.:

CHAPTER Ii.

SACRED LITERATURE, Contd.-SOME OTHER WORKS: OF PAURANIC CHARACTER

In this category we shall discuss some other theological works, which describe the nature and process of the: Hinduistic and the Buddhbistic rituals. They sometimes discuss the cosmos, myths of creation, the view of life in general, ideas of the next world and all such things which have direct bearing upon the religion of the peoples: It ought to be noted that some of the Buddhist works of this category show unmistakable: signs of Saivite theology and vice versa. Of these books,.
we shall first take up the Saivite BAwvaxakose, which means the 'treasure of the world' ! The book is divided into to chapters, called Patolas.
The first 5 patalas form the nucleus of the Brahmarahasya,.
the sixth, patella is known as the Jfiana-siddhanta-�astram..
Bhasma-mantra-sakala-vidhi-�@stram is the name of the 7th pataia, and the 8th one goes by the name of Jfiana-sam-.
ksepa-nama-fistram,. The remaining two. have. got no special name.. Dr. Goris says that it may be.
regarded as a counterpart of: the Buddhist Sang Fyang Kamahazinikaen and that it belongs: to the Tantric.
literature of the Siddhanta, School. ~. There are many.
Sanskrit Slokas, followed by an old-Javanese prose translation. The work clearly betrays some Pauranic influences, and Dr. Goris has compared a few citations from the Bhuvanahkose and the Agnipurinam to show the similarity of both. Thq verse, eg. "Iti Bhuvana-siniddhya-nama fastra, Brahmarahasyam, prathamah patalah" in the book under:.

dhyayah" of the Agripurinam, chap. 121. Similarly, "Iti Bhasma-mantra-sakala-yvidhi-�astram dvitiyah patalah" in the Bhuvanakega. may be compared with "Iti adimahapurane Agneye snana-vidhi-kathanam nama dvavim�o'- dhyayah" at the end of the zznd chapter of the Agripwr@mnam. It may be remarked, however, that many non-Pauranic works also contain these characteristics. Let us now see how the Saivite BAzvanalkosa� presents the whole theme :"Avighnam as tu: Sasanggraha kari sira movus, lingnira : (1) Pranamya, Sirase (Sirasa ?), Deva, vakyam munir amanmatha ' Devadeva, Mahadeva, ParameSvara, Sangkara

The Efglish rendering* of the above Sanskrit verses and Javanese annotations thereof may be stated as follows :- ' {

"Let there be all peace !}

Conceiving all, he (Bhargava) said the following :

(1) After bowing down his head before the Deva, the ascetic spoke the words : "O God, God of gods, great God,

2 Based. an the Dutch translation of Dr. Goris.
3 'Om avighnam astw generally comes in every Javanese work, religious as well as secular.

36 SACRED LITERATURE

The Javanese commentator then continued and explained the above thus:; The ascetic Bhargava requested the Master to describe the state of Nirvana, this was his purpose ; he made a salutation by bending low before the Master, "Sirasa"-this he did by the middle of his head.
After his worship, said he, "Devadeva'", Le. you are the God of all gods ; "Mahadeva", ie., you Master, Mahadeva is Thy name; "[MaheSvara]", (the Skt. has Paramefvara) you Master, Mahesvara is Thy name; "Sankara", You Master, Sankara is Thine epithet, and so forth.

The first chapter also speaks of Sunyasiva,' sodafavikara etc. Our author informs us that there are five different colours in the heart, viz., rakta, trivarna, asita, dipta, and sphatika, and these different hues have been described as the attributes of Aghora, Tatpuruga, Sadhya, Vamadeva, and I�@na."' The author next points out and quite in accordance with the theories of Indian philosophy that the identification of the individual soul with I�ana or Siva (Sivatmaia) leads one to Moksa or Nirvana, which is the ultimate goal of life. The process of knowing the self (@tmanam viddki), which culminates at last in a spiritual fellowship with God is not only to be met with in the Upanigads, the Bhagavadgiti etc., but also in the SaivaSiddhanta.} These evolutionary steps for the realisation of have been set forth in the (a) tattva rupa (b) tattva darfana (c) tattva Suddhi (d) atmarlipa (e) atmadarfana

Of these, the last-mentioned two are not visible and hence, Siva is generally known as Paficavaktra or the five-faced one. It is probable that the Javanese epithet Sadhya corresponds to the Indian Sadyojata.

T�he fifth stage, which corresponds to the 8th sitra of the Stvaffianavodham, lays down, "When the male (sins etc.) decreases gradually and the soul advances in virtue and knowledge, there is a greater and greater effulgence of the divine grace in it ; when the soul has sufficiently advanced in virtue and knowledge, charity and faith, the Lord appears and instructs". In this stage, the ekaem-hixam i.e., the conceptions of I-ness and My-ness gradually vanish along with the darkness of evidy@, When this vanity of Self is annihilated, the individual soul remains in communion with the universal soul, and this has been expressed here by the phrase It is, no doubt, one of the highest ideals of Indian philosophy, but in the hands of Tantricists, it has often led to the grossest abuses.

The second chapter introduces us to some details of the three worlds. - The Javanese author, - who - certainly borrowed - these ideas from the - ancient - Pauranic literature of India, has developed his idea in the light of the Indian explanation. The Javanese commentator, however, has further supplemented the list of these three worlds with an account of the different lokas. He says that Brahma, who is identical with Tatpuruga, is the ruler of the Maha loka and Janaloka is sustained by Visnu or Sadhya.
Similarly, the Tapaloka is the place of Vamadeva. The highest heaven, however, is the Satyaloka, which is Rudra's place and has been placed in the The other

places 'have been located in the navel,. The human frame has been compared here to a whole world, in different regions of, which the gods are living. This perhaps corresponds to the patemwktt-heavens of Hindu philosophy, which have been placed in what is called the stupaprasida by Javanese theologians.

The third chapter deals at some length with the Zaiivephilosophy of the Simkhya School. In the Patafijaladarfanam, there are twenty-six Teiffvwas, including the I�vara-tattwa, They are prakrti, mahat, ahanik&ara, paficatanmatra (i.e. fSabda, rupa, rasa, - gandha), paficajnanendriya, paficakarmendriya, manas, paficamahabhita and puruga, In the Simkhyak@rika' these have been resolved into four classes according to their general characteristics :"Mula-prakrtir=avikrtir= makad=adyah prakrti� vikrtayah sapta

Sodasahkas = tu vikaro na praikrtir= na vikrtih purusaly"

Prakrti is the material cause and vikrti is the effect, Defined by its nature, prakrti cannot be �derived from any other primary factor, Contrarily, that which is derived from an ultimate material cause is called vikiti, &. g. mahattattva, abarnikara and paficatanmatra. Here ahankara has been obtained from mahat ; therefore, the former is the vikrti of. the. latter, which is the source of ahanikara. In the present example, mahat is the prakrti.
Paficamahabhita and eleven Indriyas are vikrti in as much , as they have been derived from a primary source., But when any one of them, being in itself the effect of a primary cause, produces a new result, it is

'to be known as prekrfz-vikriti. Purusa,it should be noted here, is neither prakrti nor vikrti-it is called amzxbkaycrupa, ic. differing from the both fz _ foto. The implications of some of these abstruse tattvas have found place in our book, which further offers an exposition of the five elements of nature, e.g. aka�a, vayu, agni, salila and mahi --the 'Ksity-ap-tes-marud-vyoma of Sanskrit literature.
The author also describes the Duvi@daSetativa, viz, the of Rudra, Puruga, avyakta, buddhi, abhankara, paficatanmatra, (taken as one), manas, akiafSa, vayu, agni apah and prthivi, which, as stated before, belong to the Saimkhya School of thought.

The author thinks that the essence of the Tantric Siddhantafaistra has been co?cisely set forth in the 6th �chapter called Jrfianasiddhantag@stram. - The Sivajhana which is one of the fourteen Saiva Siddhanta&istras, seems to contain the gist of the pretentious 6th chapter. It says!; "The reason of the functioning : of Gof is to make the souls get rid of their male (i.e.
sins) and attain 'mxw�kt? or salvation. The souls are born in ignorance and when they obtain wisdom, they obtain \mukti", Our text opens with the following corrupt Sanskrit Slokas� :- l

So far as wa see, these verses do not explain in any way the so-called "essence" of the Siddhintajianam.
Though the author of this book assures us that one who masters this "Siddhantayfiazxam uttamam" will undoubtedly go to 'Siva-loka' (or become and shine forth like 'Aditya' (Sun) in this manava-loka (i.e. this mortal world) as long as he lives, the writer does not take any trouble to explain the nature of this philosophy in this: chapter, The next chapter, however, gives us some idea of the Svargalaksanam ; but it must be admitted that the notions explained herein are not the peculiar monopolyfof the Saiva sect alone. Let us have some samples - of these verbal gymnastics For clear exposition, we shall sometimes use diagrams. ,

The introductory portion of this chapter presents some idea of the Hindu Trinity in the three phases of Uipar#,.
Sthit� and (Pra)ina-in each of which the dominating figures are respectively Brahma, Visnu and Ivara, These three phases of the world-process are explained in terms of the Pranava mantra, which is a +4 +m =aum. In this theoCH. III ] SACRED LITERATURE 4T

logical work, each letter of this Pranava mantra has been represented by a vindu,* so that we get three vindus in all..
The first vindu which corresponds to Brahma, remains responsible for zipaff? or creation ; the second vindu or Visnu is responsible for or preservation, and the third or I�vara for (Pra)/iza, i.e. destruction. The Prapava, which has obtained such importance in the Javanese and Balinese theology, is at the root of Indian mantras. Many Hindus believe that before the creation of the world'order, there was the existence of only the Pranavamantra, which represented the sound of a great �unmyatl.
It may be that for this reason every mantra begins with aun, and it occupies such a high place in Indian theology..
The significance of the Pranava-mantra seems to have been realised by the Balinese peoples, who accepted it as a.
part of their theology.

Now, our author tells us that these three gods of the Trinity alternately assume 'the role of Prakrti, Puruga.
and Son 'and remain responsible for the world-order. As the pranava mantra has been co-ordinated to the Trinity, the elimination of a factor from any one: of them would necessarily bring the world to an.
impasse ; because, it cannot move without the sustaining.
forces, The alternate functions of the Trinity may be: elaborated with the help of some diagrams :1 Vindu, Sakti and Siva occupy as important a position in the Tantric literature of Southern India as Pati, Pagu and Pada occupy in the Kagmiriya Saivagama or Trikasiddhanta. This vindu has been.
described as "jdyate 'hdhva yatah �uddho vartate yatrua lryate.

Sa sindu paranadakhyo nadavindvanukaranam."

It has been referred to in -mainy Tantras of India. According to Prapaficasara, it has three forms, viz., Sthila, Suksma and Para.
'In Tantric literature, they are generally known as vindu, nada or vija. This nada-vindu-tattra or the philosophy of niada-vindu was equally well-known among the Tantricists of Java and India and has been referred to in many places of Indo-Javanese theology. .

(c) Pradhanam I�varam proktam Brihma purugieva ca Etat Tribhedalaksanam Vigpuh putras tathaiva ca

Thus we see that the 'Zrizity' performs some. allocated functions alternately for the creation, - preservation and destruction of the worlds, The whole idea of the Javanese theologian may probably be brought forward in 'the following diagram :A =Eka vindu=Brahma=Bhuh-loka!

U=Dvi vindu= Vigqu= Bhuvah-loka : M= Tri vindu=I�vara=Svah-loka.

C It will thus appear that the book is pum'mly a Saivite one, which has accepted some doctrines of the Simkhya - philosophy, eg., the notions of Prakri# and Puruga.

According to Kapila, salvation has to be obtained through knowledge ; according to Patafijali, through yoga. The book under review, which has accepted the Trinity of Brahma, Visnu and I�vara, cannot be included in the Nirisvara Sinmikhya school of Kapila, which seeks emancipation by knowledge. As it has, again, laid stress on 'jhinam utftamam' in the 6th chapter, it inclines to the school of Kapila rather than to Pataiijali.

We shall now describe the next important work, viz.
'the BAuvanasamksepa or the 'Synopsis of the world'. The title of the book is a pretentious one and the work, also Saivite, opens with 'Avigknam astz namo Sivaya' Like the B/Zzxvanakosa of the Siddhinta School, it is also divided into chapters, interspersed with many Sanskrit 'verses, followed by old-Javanese translation, The verbal wrangles over Pranava, Vindu, Omk@ra, etc., which also crop up abundantly in the Pauragic literature, are also some of the peculiarities of this work. In it, Uma and Kumara seek instructions from I�vara i.e. Siva, The most important.

This is perhaps the most important passage in the whole work and it offers an exposition of the author's notion of the Grazx@ Vordrxess, which he has described as Moksa, When there is neither Sun, Moon, earth, water, spirit, nor the deities of the Trinity, or, when the different senses of the human body are non-existent,-when everything is void, having no existence of time and spacethat condition has been described as Moksa. A Hinayanist would also say in the same strain, though less emphatically, that, after the present life there would be no rebirth and that 'on the dissolution of the body, beyond the end of his life, neither gods nor men shall see him'."

rriay be seen in the S?nyapur?na before the revelation of Nirafijana, �But the fact that this Moksga is possible in spite of the gods of the Trinity perhaps constitutes a new departure in the Saiva theology of Java. The Hindu idea of Moksa seems to absorb the individual soul into the universal one, just as the air of a broken pot inevitably mixes with the all-pervading air, The Javanese author takes this *universalism in the sense of a great nihilistic which appears to be an exotic re-colouring of the Indian Vedintism. ./Though Sunya-Brakma has occupied a prominent place in Indo-Javanese theology, our Saiva author has boldly pressed the idea much forward by declaring that this is above everything else in the world -even above time, space, and the gods.

The Sang Hyang Kamahaiyanikan is a manual of the Mantrayanist school. The system of Vajrayina or the cult of Buddhist Tantricism had permeated Javanese society and it owed its origin to the above-mentioned wing of the Northern church, Generally, the Tantras of the Hindus have been described as expounded by Lord Siva, while those of the Buddhists owe their main inspiration to Vajrasattva Buddha, It should be noted, however, that the principal characteristics of Tantras belonging to the Saiva and Buddhist schools of thought do not materially differ from one another. While Siva and Kali occupy a prominent position in Brahmanical Tantricism, the same status has been vouchsafed to Vajradaka and Vajradi@kini, two most outstanding figures in the school of Buddhist Tantricism.* In the Tantric literature, we come across frequent references to paficamakara,"

amavasya, Sukravara, public women, unmarried girls, etc.,

'the Indo-Javanese peoples, In order to initiate peoples into the mysteries of this noble philosophy, the Seng FEyang Kamahay@nikar has been written as a manual of the Vajracaryas,"' and the author of the book recommends it to those who are "in the mandala, and only who are faithful". In order to allure others, our author says that the Buddhas who had been and who will be, attain omniscience through the study of this Vajrayana system:the noblest of all systems.
In this book, the Buddhas have been classified into

several groups :(a) Atita-Buddha : Krakucchanda, Kanakamum and 'Kiagyapa ; (b) Anigata-Buddha: Maitreya and Samantabhadra ; and lastly, (c) Vartamiana-Buddha, who is no other than Sakyamuni,

It is to be noted, however, that where the Manusi-Buddhas have been mentioned, the names of Vipa�yi and Vi�vabhua do not occur ; but they have not been omitted in the list of the Atita Buddhas." Of the Future Buddhas, as Dr. Juynboll points out, Maitreya has generally been placed in the category of the Manusgi- Buddha, while Samantabhadra has . been grouped under the Dhyani Bodhisattva.� Of the six paramitas,* prajf@a has been defined in a Sanskrit Sloka :"Y avanti sarva-vastini dafa-dik-samsthitani ca Tani Sunya-svabhaviani prajhaparamita(h) smrtah�

The last verse is important, because it defines the ultimate nature of the highest prajfhia. as Sunxzata. After discussing the six paramitas our author introduces us to the subject of the four piramitis, e.g. maitri, karuna, mudita, and upekga.. Of these, the first knows the Zeifve of Locana, the second of: Mamaki, the third: and the fourth respective'4y mention the fetiwa or philosophy of Pandaravasini and Tari, These four are known as the spouses of the four Bodhisattvas, viz. Vajrapani, Ratnapani, Padmapani or Avalokitefvara, and Visvapini. The author then gives some details of the four yogas, which are milayoga, madhyayoga, vasinayoga and antayoga and in the same breath describes the four bhavanias, and the four aAryasatyas, Some points of iconographic interest would now arrest the attention of readers. The descriptions of some mudras of S?kyamuni, besides the names of trikhala, triratna and paficabhita, have been explained by our writer, who says that S�kyamuni is white and his mudra is the 'Dhvazamudra ; that Lokesgvara is red, and his mudra is 'the Dky@namudri ; that Vajrapani is blue and his mudra is the BAhusparkamudri. These three Tathigatas are respectively connected with the three Ratnas, viz., Buddha, Dharma and Samgha. We are further informed that Vairocana originated from Sakyamuni, Akgobhya and Ratnasambhava from Lokefvara, while Vajrapasi is responsible for the incarnation of Amitabha and Amoghasiddha.* These five worthies form the group of the Paficatathigatas and 'their respective Sekfis are Bharali Dhatvisvari, Locana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini and Tara, who are, so to speak, 'the active producing principle or female energy of the male, who symbolises the supreme soul of the universe.
'It should be noted, however, that in Java, the five .Dhyinibuddhas are also known as /zmas and - they �differ only in the position of their hands, Of the above1 Waddell, Lamaism, see the table on p. 336.

-mentioned divinities, Avalokitefvara enjoys especial honour in Java. He is recognised by his spiritual father Amitabha,.
who, in iconography, is placed in a niche of his head'dress. With one hand, he makes the gesture of dispensing" divine favour, and in the other, he holds a lotus-stem.
The best example of it is perhaps the statue of Avalokite�vara in the temple of Candi Mendut in central Java,.

Some of the Upanigadas refer to AZksarc-BraeZAma* and Akgarapuruga," i.e. Akgara, who is Brahman or Puruga.
In the present work, this AZserapurusga has been localised in the human body. It is interesting to note, however, that.
the philosophical doctrines enunciated here and in some: other parts of the book seem to bave some kinship with the: principles of the Advaita philosophy,. 'The word 'Advaitam" implies the existence of two things, in which a conception of identity has been developed, but a difference in" substance is felt ; it is apparently seen as two or dvaitam, but at 'the same time not two. This relation is called.
Advaitany or identity in duality, and the philosophy which describes this is called the philosophy and being 'the highest truth also, it is called the SiddHinta, This relation is particularly applicable to the intimate union of God with soul, which may be described in the language: of the

also speaking in the sams strain, declares <that the Aksgara or Brahman resides in the �stiipapr?s?a�a orp the human body, co-existing with th� soul, - The idea is probably borrowed . from our Siddhanta philosophy which states that the soul does not exist apart from God: This dependence, however, should not be taken to mean that soul and God is one and the same thing. The 11th sitra of the Sivaji@navodham, a work of the Fiddhinta school, for example, says, "Just like the soul, which by uniting with the eye makes the eye see objects by showing them to it, and itself sees,. so the Lord by union with the soul makes the soul know and Himself knows. This Advaita knowledge and undying life will unite the soul to His fest." Dr. Goris thinks' that the details on mahapurusa, paflicitma, paficavayu, rahasya and brahmakunda have greatly been oriented by Hindu ideas and there are reasons to believe, according to him, that the recension referred to as C, might be a Saivite re-colouring of a Buddhist original.
He says further that the mention of Agastya as an authority seems to throw it into the vortex of a Buddhistic sphere, The recension referred to as C by Dr. Goris, mentions Sindok, who was the king of Medang in the first thalf of the 1fOoth century a.D. One interesting reference is the naine of Difiniga, who might be a disciple of Asanga (6th century A.D.) and spiritual preceptor of Dharmap@la of Nalanda, who passed the last years of his life in Suvarnadvipa. Whoever he might be, we cannot regard that part very old merely on the ground that his name occurs there, We may, however, agree to the assumption of Dr. Goris that there were several strata in the growth of this work and the earliest part might have been something like a commentary on a Sanskrit text of about the 8th or oth centuries of the Christian era, to which younger sections were added later on in, about or after, the reign of.

The Septabkhuwanu, however, is a peculxar work. - It pretends-to be an encyclopaedia of the 7 worlds, 7 dv_1_pas, 7 lokas, 7 seas, etc. In some places it touches the story, of the soul's re-habitation. in the different worlds,. It seems to show that the old-Aryan belief in the Elysian fields of the different lokas-a very vague existence: beyond the funeral pyre-was not lost upon the Indonesian: peoples in the classical period of their history, But bow far it is based upon the ancient Aryan belief and how much of it is based on Austric conception has yet to be carefully analysed., These Pitrlokas and the Yamalokas are placed by the Indonesian peoples in some inaccessible and uninhabitable country,-in some neighbouring islands. The, Dayak peoples place the land of- their ancestors in some mountain-top. Where the Hindus have been rather abstract with these ideas, we find that the Indonesmn peoples have generally thought in concrete.

Our book begins with-"This is according to the Saptabhuvana : in the East, there is the saptagiri; in the South, the septignt? ; in the West, the septa-aeumkira' ; in the North, the sapte-veda* ; at the Zenith, the septa-loka, and sapita-patala in the Nether-region".

The names of the 7 dvipas, as given in the book, do not tally with those of the Balinese Brakmandapurina and their Indian counterparts, They are (1).........Gipa, (2) Jambudipa (3) Sangkadipa (4) Salmadipa (5) Gomendipa (6) Samadvipa and the (7) Krosadvipa.

dipa is the Indian Jambudvipa. The third name appears to be a corruption of the Sikadvipa, while the fourth one s probably no other than the Salmalidvipa, The seventh name of the Sepztabhuvana may also be the Indian Krauficadvipa. The remaining three great dvipas, namely, the Puskaradvipa, the Plaksadvipa and the Kufadvipa-which are frequently mentioned in the Indian literature-have either been misunderstood: or the names have been derived.
by the author from a different source. '

The book also mentions the seven lokas, viz. the Bubloka, the Bubahloka, the Svahloka, the Mahaloka, the Janaloka, the Tampoloka and the Satyaloka, In connexion with the BAzvanxakosa of the Siddbanta school, we have seen previously how these different lokas have been localised in the human body. So is the case here also.
These terms, however, are not unknown to - Indian literature, <which mentions them with some slight variations, eg., we get Tapahloka in the place of Tampoloka, and so on. The seven Nether-worlds, namely, Patala, Nitala, Sutala, Antala, Tala, Tala-tala, Mahiatala similarly correspond to the Sanskrit - Patala;, Vitala, Sutala, Atala, Rasitala, Talitala and the Mahatala.} Sanskrit Puripas have a different arrangement of these names.

The list of mountains as given in the book, betrays a crude geographical knowledge of the author, They have been mentioned in > connexion with some - abstract ideas over the placing of the holy Zfmga. The Mandara mountain, for example, has been placed in the Eastern region; the Malyavan� in the South-east; the Vindhya in the South; the Revataka in the South-west ; the Tuhina in 'the West; the _ Gandbamadana - in the North-west ; the Aila in the North and lastly, Himavan

'has been placed in the North-eastern region. In India, 'there was once the custom of erecting lingas over the �cremation-ground of a deceased religious preceptor or a saint "as though to proclaim to the world that the body buried below has attained to the sacred form of Sivalinga",

There is no denying the fact that Siva had a large mumber of votaries in South-east Asia. He has also been �depicted in the bas-relief of Angkor Vat. In Cam iconography, we find him as a door-warden, maintaining the balance of his body against a club or gesticulating terribly,.
Un Java, he is represented with four arms, three eyes, : skull, serpent-girdle and a half-Moon in his diadem. In his beneficent qualities, he is known as Bhatara Guru, while the Mahakala form represents his destroying mood. Equally prevalent was the practice of worshipping Siva in his linga form, which, like that of Cambodia, might be square, .octagonal.or cylindrical. It is placed upon a rich pedestal and the waste runnel of ablution-water sometimes passes 'through an elaborately carved-out serpent's head,; It is no wonder, therefore, that the writer of this interesting Kawi-work should lay down some details regarding the worship of Siva in his liga form, The book contains -some Sanskrit Slokas and they have been annotated in ; pure old-Javanese.

There are some other works of this character, and of them, the Taftve Sang Hyang Makhijiana ranks high in popular estimation. It belongs to the Tantric school of thought, expounding the implications of linga-worship.
'The book contains some corrupt Sanskrit verses, followed by an old-Javanese translation, It is described in the form of a dialogue between Bhatara Guru (i.e. Siva) and Kumara, of whom the latter opens the philosophical discussion with

a query about the nature of the linga-worship. Regarding the abode of the deity, one corrupt Sanskrit couplet.
runs as follows :"Apsu? devo dvijatinam, divt devatah Silikantatica lokananm, muninim atmo devatah"

ie. the god of the twice-born resides in �ixfZ2as and that of the rg/s in the firmament. 'Silikanta' or the holy linga is the deity of the commoners, while @/:es or the soul is the: god of the wizxzmis, Here the author has not only drawn a distinction between 'muni' and 'rsi, which we generally use synonymously, but has also thrust a sharp wedge between 'dvijatinam' on the one hand and 'muni-rs?' on the other. Though the Javanese commentator does not explain this point, Dr. Goris is disposed to accept rg in the sense of an astrologer, which lends a more definite colour to the: whole statement. It is interesting to note that towards the closing portion of the couplet, the Javanese author has.
re-echoed the philosophical ideas of and its further development in the Kathopanisad� and the Taiitiriyopanisad,* which exactly connote the meaning of the: Javanese author,. The book also mentions the PraZkrtpurusa doctrine of the Samkhya philosophy.

Though there are many; mantras and charms which may be attuned to Vaisnava philosophy, this religion has never been of sufficient importance to leave a more pronounced impress on the literature of the Javanese and the Balinese peoples. It is only in the Kediri records of the eleventh century A.D. that we notice a strong Visnuite tinge. It is also reflected in the literature of the epoch of king Tjitjatih, who flourished: towards the beginning of this century. A careful analysis of the names of the Javanese kings will also demonstrate the influence of this religion.

and Bali dwindles into insignificance. Now the problem is, from what region of India was this Vaispavism of the Iith century d�rived ? What is the reason behind the sudden effervescence of this cult ?

It order to answer this question, it is necessary to review the position of Bhigavatism in India before the Ith century 4.D. Though the Ghosundi, Besnagar and Nanaghat inscriptions' prove the existence of Bhagavatism in India in the early 'Christian centuries, ths cult does not appear to have made much headway in the pre-Gupta period. With the emergence and patronage of the Imperial

Guptas, it soon devel oped into a religious force in central India. By the 8th century A.b., however, it shifted its activities to the Tamil countries of the South. Satikaracarya, the great Vediantist philosopher, had once fiercely attacked the main principles of Bhagavatistmn in his commentary on 'the: Brabmasitras,2 but the cult obtained - powerful patronage from the' celebrated Acaryas of South India, of whom Ranganithicirya was the famous founder of the Srivaisgava sect, After lis death in g20 A.D., a new spirit was infused into the activities of the sect by Yamunacarya, who probably died in ro4o A. D, He was a prodigious philosopher of the early Vaisnava school and forerunner of ~ the great exponent of medieval Bhiagavatism, Raminuja.

- Now, while the cult was making such progress in the South, the Pallava rulers were gradually declining in power till they were finally ejected by the Colas.
Rajaraja the Great of this dynasty ascended the throne un 985 A. D. and pushed his conquests as far as Kalinga in the North and Ceylon in the South. His son, Rajendra Cola (FOI2-1042 A. D.), the greatest king of this dynasty,

even invaded Bengal and conquered parts :of the Malay peninsula and the little island of Sumatra. A Famil inscription of 1088 A. D., discovered in Sumatra, also points to the existence of a brisk trade-relation among 'these peoples in the South-East seas. When we think together that South India was the most active centre of contemporary Vaigsnavism, that there was a close relation between the Tamil countries of the South and Indonesia, and that Rajendra Cola had conquered the little island of Sumatra, there is a plausible ground for supposing that they would naturally afford a good scope to the Enterprising Vaisnava sect to seek new converts beyond the seas.
It is also noteworthy that the region of Java which is easily approachable from Sumatra shows first signs of Vaisnavism after the Saivite revival of 863; A.D. As Saiva doctrine predominated in contemporary Sumatra, Vaigpnva missionaries naturally diverted their energies to W. Java, Muha mmadanism, it may also be noted, spread to Java through 'the Northern coast of Sumatra.

The cause of Vaignavism > was | thus promoted in Java, but the cult never became as popular as Buddhism and Saivism. It is probably due to the fact that the. main doctrines of Vaignavism, viz.ahimsa4, ignoring caste-distinctions, solicitude for the lower classes and untouchables, are . generally covered by the articles of Buddhism, which had already built up a tradition in Indonesia and the surrounding countries.
The small influence which it exerted on the broad cultural life of the Indonesian peoples and their literature is, therefore, the natural consequence of historical facts, which we have sought to explain above, Let us now revert from this digression to the subject of literature.

It will be patent to careful observers that the style of writing in many theological works of Java and Bali

was maintained . throughout, �wecbelgevewwlth. a view to sustain, the, effect of the,.sacred language of India. . In mantras and charms, they have generally, retained their comparatively pure style and. form ; because,. corruption in them might spoil their usefulness and, service,, and this belief has probably served as, g , �heckgt�ofmaintain their somewhat original form, When the Latin hymns were translated into 'English for .cohducting: (sepryice in..

This constant fear for damaging the efficacy.of the mantras by prostituting their forms has been . greatly responsible for mamtalmno their comparative purity.. For one thing, however, we must give sufficient credit to, the Javanese authors, who have not over-burdened their theological works with tedious and grotesque details .of ludicrous anecdotes, which have no main connexion with the development of the story proper, In the matter of choosing

materials, Pauranic works of Java probably stand on a.
higher plan's than their Indian counterparts, though in

expounding philosophical doctrines they cannot aspire tothe same glory.

The Suryasewanas hterally means the worship of vaa as the Sun-god, i.e., Surya. The oldest nations of the worldu-the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Elamites and the Indxans for example-gonducted their earliest liturgies milhonom of the Sun-god, and some of the documents, of the old world, e.g., ths Book of the Dead, the Vedas, the Avesta, and the Papyrii bear an eloquent testimony to the position held by the Sun-god in the daily life of the ancient peoples.
\Under the m?uence of growing Tantr1c1sm, however, the Sun�god lost the glory of Vedic times and was gradually pushed off by Slva, with whom he was. eventually Identxfed. In the Aampumnam,� for example, we come across "Art padme S iva-surya iti." Examples of this type also occur in the Seure- and the Garuda-pumnam P�r Goris, who dlscussed the Surpas�vana, is of opinion that the cult -of Sivaditya was a distinct feature of the Balinese rituals and in one of their Z2ute-mantras, we find the formula, "Om hram -- hrim - sah - parame- Sivadityaya namaly."? , So we see that not only in India, but also in Indonesia, there was going on an effort on the part of interested sects to merge the 1denttty of some deities in Lord Siva, who, according to the Afazgarakrmgama was the "uppermost of all gods It reminds us of the ancient Egyptian parallel, in Wlnch we notice the working of the process

by which the Sun-god Ra gradually absorbed the attributes.
of all other satellite-godheads and appeared as the monotheistic Sun-god Aton in the reign of Ikhnaton. The only: difference is that in Indonesia in spite of the working of a | process towards monotheism, it was not established as a factor in the philosophy of religion, [At any rate, the Surya sevana must be regarded as a very interesting contribution: to the study of Indonesian theology, which, as we shall see later on, was partly oriented by Brahmanical Tantricism,

The method of conducting service in the Tantric and Paurapic schools contains some common features as well as some noteworthy differences, Both lay great stress on the purification of the body, which: ensures the successful attainment of the goal in view..
Similarly, the offerings meant for dedication to the deities.
have also to be purified in course of the service. In Tantric worship, particular care is taken for wine and bloodoffering to the deities concerned, though Brahmanical yajfias can dispense with these things altogether, The.
followers of the Tantric school, again, would generally worship in lonely places, the best place being a cemetery: and the most opportune moment is an emavegy& (pitchdark) night, which would synchronise with Friday or Tuesday..
The celebrated drama Ma/laefimadkavan offers in its fifth Act a graphic description of Tantric worship conducted by the Kiapalika Aghoraghanta, who had kidnapped Malati with a view to sacrifice her in a cemetery at dead of night. In such worship, wine is offered to the deities, if possible, jin a human 'skull, and when the service is finished, wine, which is supposed to have been relished by the deity, is reverently distributed among the devotees. In purely Brabhmanical pujas, a priest of the first varne is - necessary ; in Tantric rituals, it is not an absolute condition.

These are some of the external characteristics of TanCH. IV] THE SURYASEVANA, MANTRAS AND CHARMS _ 63�:

tric rituals, As regards the intefnal . process ;ofworship,; we may. base our observations on the famous KamaikAyitantra. In - some centres of - East-Indian Tiantricism, a - devotee - carefully controls his five - frxdriyas or sense-organs and, on. an auspicious takes diksa from a guru or spiritual preceptor, If a guru be not available, the image of one who commands the respect of the devotee is placed by imagination in the middlepoint between the two eye-brows. And then a particular mantra is mumbled 100,000 times, which lends a motiveforce or caitanya to the uttered mantra, This japa or chanting of the mantra is preceded and followed by some rituals, known as the Zremagad@hati, When the ?ap? is ?nishea, setusutaka and prindyima have to be performed.

Every principal mantra has to be regarded as emitting: lights of perfect knowledge. This is called the wmeenfradtkka.
The devotee convinces himself that . these - mantras are awakening the Kz/lekundaelini, which sweeps from the mulidhara to the Brakmarandhra. Mr, T. A. Gopinath Raot describes this in the following manner.} "This Sakti", says he, "may be conceived to be the personification of universal energy in the abstract. She resides in the macrocosm as well as in the microcosm. The discovery or development of Sakti or psychic energy in man� is the aim of mantragastra.* The Sakti which resides inman and the development of which is one of. the aims of | the yoga�astra is called Kundalini Sakti, The place, where it resides is called miladhara and is understood to be at the lower extremity of the spinal cord, By a successful development and working of this Sakti at the mailadhara

-even the attainment of Molsa or the liberation of the soul is believed to become possible". In the human body, as is. wellknown to Indian theologians, there are.six plexuses called The first, as referred to previously, is called the muladhara-cakre, which is the most important plexus.
'The second one is known as the gz�v?d?z�s�/z?mmkm, which corresponds to the prostatic plexus. The third one is called 'the Manipurakacakra, which seems to be identical with the epigastric plexus, The fourth one is called the �calira, which is no other than the cardiac plexus. The fifth .and the sixth are and AjhakAhyacakra, which respectively correspond to the pharyngeal and the cavernous �~plexuses,. .

When a man can control the volume of life-current that - penetrates into the body and the various functions of the different plexuses, he can awake �all the powers latent in a human frame. The yogins �~with an intense desire to evolve all these powers, concen'trate their main energy from the lowest to the highest plexus for the full development of the spiritual life-current.
'The control of the breathing organs is, therefore, recogmised as a primary necessity by the general body of the '"'Tantricists, The Kam@kAkyatantra says that when . the ~Kulahkundalini; which. sweeps from the miuladhara to the 'Brahmarandhra, is viewed as containing the, effulgent body of the ifgtadevafi, the stage is called the. mantrirtha.
'When one has obtained the essence of the inner meaning ~of this mantra, he attains moksa or salvation.

With these preliminary remarks on the Tantric and ~the Brahmanical � practice of conducting services, we -�now pass on to consider the famous SZryaesevexa mantra of Java and Bali, which, along with other mantras and charms, bas occupied a prominent position in the Indo~ Javanese theology.

J; ; _ The Sturpasevana or the worship of the Sivaditya begins

"with the ceremony of Talabedana and Kara�odhana,. The

�CH, IV] THE SURYASEVANA. MANTRAS AND CHARMS 65

Kara�odhana has to be conducted with the help of both the hands :With the right hand-"om suddha mam f&vaha"

With the left hand-"om atifuddha mam &vaha'"'

After making both the hands pure, the priest mumbles -some other mantras and the Pranayama. It is conducted in the pose of puraka, kumbhaka and recaka. After this

pranayama is finished, the worshipper mumbles the astranantra-(a) 'Om am hrday@aya namah

{b) Om arkaya firase namah

(c) Om bhurbhuvah svare jvalini Sikhayaih namah

(d) Om hrm kavacaya namah

(e) Om bham netraya namah

(f) Om hiim rah phat astraya namah"

Dr. Goris draws our attention to the fact that this mantra also occurs in the Gerzdae-puzrinaem with the only difference that in the place of (c) and (e), we find, "om al bhur bhuvalh - svah jvalint vagat' and "om bhim netrubkhyanm vausat"' respectively. Besides, he says, in the place of 'namah'-which occurs at the end of the Balinese mantras-we get namah, svaha, vasat, ham, vausat, phat, etc., at the end of the Indian mantras.

After this comes the next stage of this Surya-arcanid, ~viz., the omkira. Itis performed with fcamanae and some other minor rites, eg., Trykgara, Trmandala, Gangadevi, Saptatirtha,� etc, The formula opens with"Om parama-Siva-Ga?gz�iya namah Oin bram hrim vausat paramavSiVQ-myt?ya namah" *

66 THE SURYASEVANA, MANTRAS AND CHARMS

_ {t is followed by the writing of Trykgara (A +U+M) on: the surface of water, The Sapta-tirtha mantra may be quite interesting to Indian readers, because it gives a

list of the rivers which were sacred in the eyes of the Bali-nese and, the Javanese peoples. It runs as follows :-*

Om am Ganigayaih namah

.Om am Sarasvatyaih namah

Om am Sindhave namah

Om aim Vipa�@yai namah

Om am Kaugikyai namah

Om am Yamun@yai namah

Om am Sarayuye namah.

The list was certainly prepared in the post- Vedic period ;;

because, we find here a commingling of the names of the ancient, sacred rivers of India with those of the younger ones. Q/jAfter the 7 holy rivers of India are invoked tosanctify the waters of the the worshipper proceeds with a group of mantras, which, according to Dr.
Goris, are directly connected with the Pauranic Sfuryarcana..
They are Catur-aifvarya,. Saptasvaravyafnjana, NavaSakti, Tritattva, Kiuta-mantra (which represents the essential one-ness of Siva and Surya) Brabmanga or Sivikarana, Siv??ga, Garbhamantra, . Astagraha, Caturtarpana, etc.
These. are . done by. padmasang or anantasana. When these long-drawn mantras are over, then begins the ma?�m, ig. the mantra, which is chanted along with Ghanta-dhvani or the ringing of bells, It.runs as follows :om ! ; . ' g 38. a

' abhavabhavakarmegu varana. labdha-samdaha vara(m) siddhi nir-sam�aya(m).
After this is finished, the worshipper

with humble obeisance recites a mantra, craving pardon of the god.. This is also the characteristic of the latter .
portion of the Indian formulas. It is written in very simple, though corrupt Sanskrit, and' breathes a sincere spirit throughout. It runs as follows :- "Om ksamasva mim Mahadeva, sarvaprana-hitankara !
mam moca sarva-papebhyah, palayasva Sadagiva ! Papo 'ham, papakarma'ham, papatma4 papasambhavah ! trahi mam sarvapapebhyah, kenacid mama raksatu ksantabyah kayik& dogih, ksantabyah vacika mama, ksantabyih manasa dosiah, tat pramiadam ksamasva mam.

Paripurpan tat ustu ine,""

No body can deny that the entire mantra breathes an earnest spirit of resignation at the feet of Lord Siva. In a Surya-arcani, this intrusion of Siva as an overlord is really very interesting and. shows how far Saivism had penetxated into the theology of the ancient Balinese peopless.
jifter this mantra is over, several other s�avaes or hymns follow, eg., the Apsu deva, Sapta omkara,: Stava-bhatara Sapta- Grange, etc. yhen we come across a set of formulas over dhipa, dipa, gandhapuspa and some. rxtuals connected with udakafijali and padyarghyzu gfhen follows the celebrated Myiyunjaya mam�m,. iwhlch opens, with "Om

This sort of prayer for blessings is characteristically present in all bymns of all countries, The frail human body has to struggle throughout life against all vicissitudes, and the hope of the touch of God's magic wand gives strength and stability to the enterprise of mankind. The language and tone of the above priirfZkand has been couched in a purely Indian fashion ; because, it not only asks for '@harma-santina vrddki', which is the pervading spirit of Manu's Institutes, but also prays for an outstanding position in the world as long as it lasts, The idea of this mantra, partly or wholly, has been echoed and re-echoed in different places of Indo-Javanese literature. Even in a record of the oth century A.D., we come across the following corrupt verses, written in Anustubh chanda :"Yavat Candra�ca Suryyafca !
ri Sakalalo dipitah / t tavat sangsaraga macat j aveci kanarakang brajet //"* f

In India, too, there are many mantras of this type. f Hymns for different pujas of Beugal, eg., Aramyasasthi, f Nagapahcami, Nataigasthi, Suvacani, Nitali, Vudothaikrun, t Ghentu, Kular, Mulii, etc., have also been couched in the same spirit, In the Tog/� urate, for example, we come across the following pregnant lines :- f

"Kodal-kata dhan pavo / gohal-alo garu pavo /

The devotee, evidently a woman, asks for the following boons : gold that has to be turned out with a spade ; cows that will verily adorn a cow-shed ; son that will be the ornament of a court ; son-in-law, who will enhance the brilliance of a sadk% or assembly ; a daughter, who will adorn the room ; basket, which will be full of vermilion.
She will also like to live in the town, die in the sea,

Now, after this IH is over, the Bhasmamantra begins and is followed by the very interesting which contains a part of the celebrated

Indian Gayatri mantra, We shall quote only that part of the mantra, which contains the Gayatri verse :37

"...... ... Iti veda-mantra gayatri matra-miatra (?)

70 'THE SURYASEVANA, MANTRAS AND CHARMS

We know that the full text of the Gayatri mantra is, "Om bhur=bhuvah svah tat Savitur=varenyam | Bhargo Devasya dhamahi dhiyo yo nah pracodayat |/"

It has a long history co-eval with India's cultural history. The penetration of this jealously-guarded mantra into a land beyond the prohibited seas is really interesting and thought-provoking. It probably implies three sins committed by the Brihmanas of those far-off days. Firstly, it is possible that the Brahmanas themselves were responsible for importing it into Indonesia (because, only the twice-born were privileged to learn it and, as the first varna belonged to the priest-class, they took this STuryasevana mantra to Indonesia); secondly, they crossed the seas and thirdly, they taught it to non-Indian non-Hindus. Though the caste-fiction was gradually developed there, it was merely an imitative system based on the social hierarchy of ancient India, To teach this mantra to the native Brahmanas of Java and Bali is, therefore, an example of twisting the forms of the scriptural injunctions at the cost of their spirit, At any rate, it shows how the ideals of orthodox Brahmanism become modified outside the stronghold of rigid Brahmapism. '

the yeyfiopavita-mantra is finished, we come to the last stage of the worship, which is merely counting the beads of japamaAla about 108 times, and the mumbling of prayers and dhyana, After this is done, Lord Siva, who had temporarily penetrated into the worshipper's frame, leaves the fontanel 'and - goes again to the abdominal cavity, And the worship is thus concluded.

These mantras, as a general rule, were kept in secret both in India as well as in Indonesia. The priests -were in charge of this spiritual lore, with which they inspired awe of the credulous peoples. The Tantricists also . share the same belief and they state in no- uncertain . terms, "One may deliver all his riches, even his wife and life, but never the guZyamanitra (i.e. Tantra) to any

on� else"", "The celebrated Garudeya mantra of Java also speaks in the same strain :- ' ' "Itt Sang Hyang Garudeya . Samiptam. - 'Rahasya Sira', kaya tnaikna de Sang sadhaka"".
It is a mantra which should be kept in secret as a 'rahasya.' " ' Some other mantras we are going to discuss, have been written partly in prose and partly in verse, Some of them possess immense iconographic values ; because, 'they describe the peculiar features of the god-head, from whom some succour is sought. We select a Visqumantra, called the Narasimkadhyana, which represents two charac'teristics of Narasimha or Visnu. The first section describes the god in his awful figure and is called the Tiksnamantra.
'The latter portion represents him in his beneficent qualities and has, therefore, aptly been described as the 'Somya. manira'. 'This mantra, besides all such peculiarities, throws additional light on the influence of the all-pervading Sastm.
As we have said before, Visnu was not very popular in Java, His mount or vahana is Garuda, who occupies a . more prominent place in Javanese iconography, and is represented with a ferocious grin. This, as Krom points out, is in refreshing contrast to the calm majesty of the rider.
Many statues of this Divinity have been preserved in the . museum of Mojokerto . f The original text of the Narasinhamantra, which has- 3 "been written in easy intelligible Sanskrit but with some mixture of Javanese mystic terms, then continues :"Om Narasithaya sarvaSatruvinaSaya pat, Narasinmhadhyana sahastra nira. Um hrum khadgefvaraya sarvaSatruvinafaya pat ; pir, ma, um hrum Sankhapaficajanyaya sarva�atruvina�aya, pat, gneng muka, ma, um brum cakra1 Vide Kularnava Tantra, K?i?c?rap?ja. os 2 Vide Bijdragen T.L.VK., 7th series VI, 1908, p. 412; cf. also HS 508, Primbon, 119 folia in bid, deel 69, pp. 3874. +

� The portion quoted above shows how Vignu in hisNarasinha incarnation was represented by the Javanese peoples. The mantra then continues :"Om Narasinhaya namah ugra visnumahaviryyam jvalantam sarvatomukham. - Nrsinha@bhisganam mrtyumrtyun namamyabam. - Tikspgamantra iti." _/ This Javanese may be compared with a similar Indian one, which betrays the same general characteristics. The text of the Indian NrstmZamaentra, also used as a protection of limbs, runs as follows:"Ugram viram Maha-Vispum jvalantam sarvatomukham/ Nrsinham bhigapam bhadram mrtyumrtyum namimyaham/ Dvatrin�adakgaro mantro mantrarajah suradrumah/ Kantham patu dhruvam. kgsraum hrdbhagavate cakgugi mama/ Narasinhaya ca jvalami@line patu mastakam/ Diptadaistriya ca tathagni netraya ca nasikam/ Sarvarakgoghnaya sarvabhiata, vina�aya ca/ SarvajvaravinaSiya daba daha pacadvyam/ Raksa rakga varma castram svahia patu mukham mama Taradiramacandraya namah payidgudam mama) Klim.
payat parsvayugmafica taram namah padam tatab.*"

It would thus appear that the first portion of these: two passages is almost identical. It is a pity, however, that the Aikgnamantra section of the Javanese Narasinhadhyana. ends abruptly, The theme, however, is continued in the Nompamantra, which ends with "/z Vazm Narastmha kahilangan ing satru don ira mwang Sarirakszaka"

It means, "This is the Vajra (or weapon) of Narasinha,.

who is the destroyer of the enemies and protector of the limbs." Two verses have been added to this with an oldJavanese explanation, which points to the fact that this mantra has to be used at the time of warfare and one.
who uses it must come out victorious. The latter portion of the Indian which we have quoted before, contains the following verses :--"Trailokyam - kgobhayatyeva - trailokya-vijayi bhavet/ Bhiatapretah pificaica raksgasi dianavafca ye/ tam drstva.
prapaliyante de�adde�@ntaram dhruvam" etc.

Cod. 5325 of the Lombok collection is also a Visqumantra, called the Visgnw-staeve, which, along with Cod.
5332, ends in a peculiarly lndian fashion with *Svaha.' Both are written in Sanskrit. As the general burden of all these mantras is not materially different, we shall not deal with them at any great length. We only quote a few verses from Cod. 5331, which have got legions of parallels in Indian scriptures and mantras} :�Pada rakgantu Govindo, janggabhayiafica Trivikramah,.

The prevalence: of these mantras demonstrates the spirit of Brahmanical Hinduism in Java and Bali. Even now, the old religious peoples +of the orthodox families in 'India, mutter the following Sloka, while rising from bed in the early morning :"Ahalya Draupadi Kunti Tara Mandodari tatha Paficakanyah smarennityam - mahiapatakanaSanamp.

We have no information if the earlier part of this mantra

beginning with (Brakmamurarisiripurantakairi bhainu Sasi, etc,, which we have not quoted here, and the latter part be-ginning with 'Prxnyasloko Nalo ri;a', had ever been present : among the Javanese and the Balinese peoples, but the - occurrence of the middle two verses, viz, "Om Abalya Dropadi Sita Dara Mandodari tata . smare nityam-" is really striking, as they demonstrate the socio-religious parity of the Indo-Javanese people in the classical period of their history,. The substitution of the name of Sita for that of Kunti is rather interesting and it '~serves to show the unique position 'of the heroine of the Ramayana.

we draw between these two sets of formulas is that while the one is an invocation to God or gods for some help or protection, the other is an incantation to cure some diseases or some physical disabilities, in which the invoker threatens the God or gods in case these disabilities are not removed or redressed. Judging from this standpoint, the 'Garudeya manrtra is no mantra at all, but a mere charm against snake-bite. Here the vahana or vehicle of Visgu is Garuda, and he has been invoked to counteract the influence of poison. Frequently, we come across such words as 'vigapaha', 'vigahari' 'vigadaha', etc. Such charms are widely prevalent in all India. In Bengal, we have a vast unpublished literature on them. It is generally believed by peoples that they lose their efficacy, if they see the light of the day and hence, they remain in 'rakasya' just like the Javanese and Balinese charms.
Quite contrary to ordinary custom, some of the Bengali charms were published by : Mir Khoram Ali, and the oldest of them reminds one of the Bengali literary style of the Iith and 1zth centuries A.D. We notice here invocations to Manasa, Siva, Kali, Garuda, Krsna and other deities of .
the Hindu pantheon, An unalloyed example,; of this character is the 'mrtavatsa' charm, which has been intended to stop the birth of stillborn children of women.

to us. It generally means 'open or bare', but the sense is

limitations, our translation of the above charm would be asfollows :"Khola, Khola, Oh Mr. Khold, my eyes are on you..

N There is a huge unpublished literature on this subject in the lands of South-east Asia, Beginning with the charms of the Afkarvaveda, the sceptical Kautilya's formulas� to stupefy animals, to make doors open, to change appearance -the whole subject has undergone numerous changes and transformations in succeeding

development of the Indo-Javanese charms of this category.
Mal-Polynesian charms also do not fall into a different class, and we offer here a representative example to serve as a model :- |

"Hai Raja Hanuman, Aku tahu kena asal-mu Ibu-mu Tuan puteri Siti Dewi Baha-mu Rajs Seri Rama Mu membawa Sinjoh Tarak

Make her mad and distracted for me !
Fear my order, Jf you hear not,

I will curse you !"

The last portion is important, because it shows the usual characteristics of the charms. The same volume of the Malay Branch of the Royal: Asiatic Society contains some more charms, but they seem to have been influenced by the religion of the prophet of Mecca. For example, one of the charms uses the expression, "PBape-uu Nadi Makanm:mad" and it is stated with reference to Sri Rama, who has . been described as the son of the prophet of Mecca. The

last portion of these charms does not materially differ: from one another, and the general - tone of Indo-MailPolynesian charms seems to draw them to the same: vortex. <- The 'vitt�-cilanir mantra', which probably owed its origihb�to the yogis of the Niatha-Samprada@ya (it mentions Goraksaniatha), and numerous snake-bite-cure mantras -which, of course, fall under the class of charms-naturally lead us to the conclusion that at one pe'rioid of our country's history there was a closer contact with the Mal-Polynesian peoples than we are supposing heretofore and to this, the foregoing charms bear an eloquent testimony.
The frequent occurrence of the names of Indian gods in these charms proves conclusively that they owe their origin to India or to Indian colonists of those regions.

We now come to a close of our discussion on the so-called "Vedic literature of Indonesia." The immense richness of the language and its indebtedness to the sacred literature of India can hardiy be doubted for a moment. < In every phase of Indonesian culture, the.
contributions of the Hindus and the Buddhists have been: profound and abiding. It. is a matter of great regret, however, that we have no positive data at our disposal.
to say who were responsible for the importation of thesacred literature of India to Java and Bali. As regards the acute question over the Vedas, Crawford says! ; "I have looked in vain both on Java and Bali for any vestige of Hindu scriptures or Vedas and though I reasonably doubt the skill with which the enquiry was pursued, I am.
yet strongly inclined to believe that they have no exis= tence and probably never had among the Hindus of oriental. islands. - It se�ms < singular �enoughf'dtha?anw orthodox sect of Hindus, as the worshippers-of Siva are,

should not be in possession of the sacred text. - The inferior castes among the Hindus are by the ordinances� of their religion interdicted. from reading the Vedas.
Did the first Brahmanas, who settled in the Archipelago, .
lie from some impurity or contamination under a similar interdiction ; or, were they pretended Brahmanas only and in reality persons of inferior rank, to whom the use of the Vedas was unlawful? or lastly, did the first Brahmanas, compelled by the necessity to intermarry with the aboriginal inhabitants conscientiously forbid the Vedas to their polluted posterity."

We are inclined to subscribe to the last view of Crawford. The absence of the sacred thread *, along with the fact that by the Vedas probably the Javanese and the Balinese peoples understood nothing but charms, would naturally tend to show how the socio-religious theories of the Hindus bave been modified, distorted or otherwise artificially manipulated in Indonesia for the exigencies of the situation,. Here the Indian tradition, though modified, became a living religion, which was never questioned by the unsophisticated peoples and, if there was no sanction behind any institution, that was made up for by the catholicity and the spirit of accomodation which characterised the Javanese mind. The Javanese peoples thus accepted the principles of the social hierarchy of India and borrowed her religious views, but a substantial portion of her literature bearing on the subject practically remained sealed to them, - Besides, many lontar-records were not duplicated in later times and thus the invaluable records of ancient Indo-Javanese culture have been partially lost,the fragments that have escaped the ravages of time and men are all that we possess at the present moment.

enunciate any negative proposition on the basis of these extant materials would, therefore, be a very rash conjecture, which may or may not be verified by historical researches, The 'Vedic literature of Indonesia', at any rate, is something like a commentary on the Orthodox Hinduism of our country and tears off some of the prevalent notions of Brailhmanical exclusiveness as a mere . myth,

Thls mxghty cultural contact between the two peoples �of south east Asia not only accelerated the growth of the Pauranic literature in Java and Bali, but also led to the foundation of Jurisprudence and Niti literature, which were evolved to suit the requirements of the peculiarlyconstituted Indo-Javanese society. For the sake of convemience, we shall divide this chapter under two heads, viz-(1) the Niti literature, which contains a rich stock of moral precepts and maxims, and .(2) the /urisprud@ence or. legal literature. We propose to consider first. A. The Niti Literature

A large number of works belonging to this class of " literature has sought to expound the ideals of morality, 'the duties of men' and women in different walks of life, and has discoursed upon certain principles of religion and ethics. - {Ihe celebrated book, S@resemwccaya, an OldJavanese work with sprinklings of Sanskrit quotations, may be regarded as a good Niti work, which includes a large number of moral precepts gathered from different Indian sources. The book was noticed as early as 1849, when Dr. Friederich published his 'voor/loopig verslcg var het eiland Bali. But he was unable to read the title of 'the book which he explained as Sirase and Moestjaja.
Ut opens with the story how the author of the book, Bhagavan Vararuci, gathered the essence of the paiva.' It says'- "Bhagavan Vararuci mupulaken s@ra-sira sang hya'ng' Astadafaparva, gave bhagavan Byasa."

; The author has adopted a large number of Slokas from the Anus@sanaparvan ; some have also been borrowed from the Adiparvan, the Udyogaparvan, the Paficatantram, the: Hitopade�a, etc. Dr. Juynboll has made a comparative study on the basis of these common fSlokas, and we quote here only a few to demonstrate the similarity of these Slokas with one another,.

from the Adiparvan"Yathi samudrobhagavan yathi Merur f \o -__ ~* Ubhau khyatau ratnamdh1 tatha f Bharatam ucyate." Like the: Sanskrit MakadAGrata, the Paficatantram has also been requisitioned by the Javanese author, who has .

substituted by 'mriyusersi pPatisyat?" in the Javanese Sirasamuccaya. Nobody would deny the importance of the Sircsamuccaya from the view-point of comparative study. It can certainly control, though to a limited extent, certain Slokas of

the Mahabharata, the Hitopadesa, the Paficatantram, etc., The sprinklings of Sanskrit Slokas have also enabled us to infer that the author was well-acquainted with these Indian works, and what is more, he had the capacity to understand Sanskrit and translate it fairly well into the dialect of the country. According to Dr, H. N. Van der Tuuk, the prose-portion is "very corrupt." It was probably composed in the 14th century A.D. J f Of very great importance are two Buddhist works, the.
Sang Hyang Kamahiyanikan and the KRunjarakarnma. We had occasion to discuss the former one in connexion with the Pauranic literature of Java and Bali; we shall now consider the legend of Kufijarakarna, which was: probably written in W. Java. 3 The Kuxfhjarakarna is an edifying story, in whlch * Dhyanibuddha Vairocana expounds the meaning of DZarma to the Yalkga Kufjarakarga by means of allegories. It was translated by Dr. Kern as early as and was also discussed at some length by C. M. Pleyte.* It states that a certain Yakga, Kufijarakarna by name, wanted to attain a higher state of perfection in a subsequent re-birth and, therefore, sought instructions in DZarme and Law from Vairocana, who was residing in Bodhicitta The Great Master accepted him as a disciple of his, but he first wanted him to go to Yama, the King of hell, to see personally how the wicked are punished and tortured,. Accordingly, he �went to hell and took lessons from Yama on the "phisology of the transmigration of souls" - In certain respects, Kufijarakarnaappears here in the same �0/e which

was played over centuries ago by Naciketa in the Kathopanigad,} though the philosophy of religion as expounded in the latter work is decidedly of a higher order.
That the soul never dies, is also a pervading note of this work,? and the Buddhist philosophy of the Mahayianist School has been discussed at almost every page, However, after giving a long discourse on religious subjects, Yama informed Kufljarakarga about the arrival of a very great sinner, who was, to his utter surprise, no other than his: old friend, Vidyadhara Piurnavijaya,

Immediately after taking leave of Yama, he repaired to the house of Pirnavijaya. As Piirnavijaya was in deep sleep, the door of the house was opened by his wife, Kusumagandhavati. Being pressed by the guest, Kusumagandhavati awakened her husband, who heard with some dismay the description of his lot in hell. Piurnavijaya was much too frightened at his gloomy future, which he wanted to escape by adequate penances. - He decided, therefore, to seek the shelter of Vairocana through his friend Kufijarakarna, who gladly consented to introduce him to the Master. Now, both of them set forth for the abode of the great Saviour and Kufijarakarna, who had finished } his courses in the Yama-loka, presented himself to Vairo- | cana and desired to be initiated into the process of selfpurification and self-immolation. He did not, however, forget the case of his wretched friend Pirnavijaya, who was I undergoing intense mental sufferings. |

Vairocana broke off his meditation and, after accepting : him as his disciple, propounded the highest doctrines of philo- | sophy and ethics, which served to destroy his demoniac figure.
Parnavijaya was also honoured to sit at the feet of the Great Master, whose luminous discourses brought about a great change in his vision of life, But he could not still estape

1 Vide Ist and 2nd valli, 2 Cf, also Kothopahisad, ist valli, 19.



CH. V] THE AGAMA OF INDONESIA r

the death-sentence, which was hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles, He, therefore, requested Vairocana to minimise the rigours of his penalty in bell, as were first apportioned to him. After getting some assurances, he returned home and absorbed himself in deep

meditation and religious works in accordance with the advice of the Master, After the period of penance was over, he told his wife that he would fall in a death-trance, which would not be relieved till the IIth day. On that day, his soul would re-enter the body, after going through accustomed punishments in hell. During his days of trial in bell, while his soul was going to be thrown into a pan on fire, a miracle happened. In the place of the firepit, grew up a beautiful Kelpatarzx, whose branches hang over a watery-place that was studded with the most exquisite flowers. Purnavijaya also began to emanate signs of health, vigour and strength! It appeared that the soul of him has been reanimated with a halo of divinity !

Yama was taken aback in astonishment and he enqmred of Piurnavijaya about the significance of all these miracles. He ascribed all to Vairocana's blessings and Yama, apparently satisfied with the explanation offered by Purnavijaya, set him at liberty to break off his short-term sojourn in hell. On the 11th day, he re-entered the corpse and requested his wife to invite all vidyadharas and vidyadharis, who would sing hymns in honour of Vairocana, Vairocana, meanwhile, had departed to the heaven of gods, where Indra and Yama were present. They asked him how it was that the condemned Piarnavijaya, who was sentenced to undergo punishment for 100 years, was released so soon.
Vairocana then explained the whole thing and described that in a previous life both Pfurnavijaya and Kufjarakarnathen known as Muladhara and Kirnagata-were guilty of nursing some jealousy against a certain Utsibadbarma, It

is quite interesting to note that the work called

86 THE AGAMA OF INDONESIA

tattvaparicaya� deals with the subject of their previous birth and adduces some interesting informations, The wife of Mualadhara, for example, has not been mentioned in the KufTgjarakarna ; in the other work, her name appears as Sumalini. Similarly, Sudharma of the legend of Kufijarakarna, who is no other than the wife of Utsihadharma, appears here in a slightly modified from,-Sudharmiks. The name of Kirnagata has also been transformed into Karnagotra.

Atter explaining the history of the past lives of these persons, Vairocana returned to his own heaven, Meanwhile Piurnavijaya informed his wife that he would go to practise self-immolation for 12 years, and accordingly he repaired to the mountain Mahimeru, where he discovered his friend Kufijarakarna, - Both of them built cloisters there and began to practise hard austerities and, after the elapse of 12 years, by the grace of the Master, they became siddhas and went to the Siddha-heaven. Penances and sacrifices for 12 years are also frequently.to be met with in ancient Indian religious literature.

(sg _ This is, in short, the legend of Kufijarakarna. It shows belief in the transmigration of soul, that the activities of the past life determine the status of the future and that the application of samadhi, penances, etc., ultimately lead persons to final salvation. Though these are some of the characteristics of Hindu philosophy, the manner of treatment of the subject proper draws it into the. vortex of the Mahayanist school, whose teachings have been elaborated through religious discourses and moral aphorisms, (A succinct account of its philosophy may be seen in Krom, Borobudur, Vol. II, pp. 302ff ; cf. Kern,. Verspreide Geschriften, IV, pp. 149-177). . f ' ; _. According to Dr, Kern, the' Kufhzarakarna has to be placed in the 'isth century A.D. According to Dr. Juyn: go soe g '< 1.

boll, however, the Koravi�rame, the Asramavisaparva and the Kufzarakarnaare dated at about the same period, -the 4th century Aap.* These three books use some interjections. - The Kufijarakarna, for example, uses 'seg les rep! This is a characteristic of contemporary Sundanese Aditerature and, therefore, these writings might have been composed in W. Java,. It is also noteworthy that the oldest MS., which was utilised by Dr. Kern, is derived .from this region. �

There is also a Middle-Javanese work of some importance, which can be brought under this category. It is called Navaruci ; in Java, it is also known under the name of ot Deva Ruci� The contents of this book .are given in the following words* :"Dock Wrekodara poerveita ring Dangnjang Droena kinon angoepaja tojuninghkang ngoetfikake maring sariranipoen' ie. Vrkodara or Bhima is the student of Drona, who sends him to bring water so that his body may be purified.

The story is as follows: Bhima was sent by Drona 'to bring 'Amrtafijivan?t from the hill of Tjondra Moeka (candramukha ?). There he fought against giants and finally slew two Butas (i.e. or spirits) viz., Sang Rukma and Sang Rukmala, and upturned the hill for the discovery of the holy water. But he did not find it there, A voice of Indra Baju informed him that he 'had been misled and that he ought to go again to Ngas'tinat for further light on the exact location of the place,.
He followed the advice and Drona told him that the water had to be procured from the depth of the sea, Here also

Bhima did not find the holy water-the tirta prawitaja or toja marja of Cod. 1804-but instead of it he saw innumerable monsters and gigantic snakes, Meanwhile, the Pandavas were very anxious, and naturally the Kauravas were very jolly, over the long absence of Bhima. In his random wanderings, however, he came across a philosopher at the bottom 'of the sea ; he was no other than Devaruci, the Navaruci of Cod. 4342 of Juynboll's Catalogue. He described himself as a very favourite one of Bhatara Guru, ie.,.
Siva and informed Bhima that the thing he sought for might be discovered in the guwagarba. Dr. van der Tuuk notes* that in these exploits he succumbed and was revived by Bhagavan Navaruci or Bimasuci.

The Middle-Javanese work Pulztukis a dialogue between Mpu Lutuk and Ahbaskara over the lot of a deceased soul. Of similar nature is the which is a didactic prose work* ; it describes the conversation between Ciptavarana and Valakula, This is written. in Old-Javanese, but the style is not very pure. There might also be some justification for taking the work 'Renpeyaezfia' as a fufur or Niti-work,.3. It contains some Sanskrit Slokas,. It begins with 'Avighnam astu' and states in which heaven men will depart if killed in a particular way, If any one, for example, be killed by an arrow -the author tells us-he: will certainly go to the heaven of Bayu (i.e. Vayu) Here: Rana or (war-field) has been compared to a huge sacrificial pit, wherein human sacrifices are offered.

us an account of the different obligations of human life. .The first book, namely Adipurana, which is an OldJavanese prose-work, is partly based upon the Old-Javanese Adiparva, and begins with a discourse on 18 duties over marriage, respect to be paid to elders and masters, etc."

In this book, the speaker is Murtthitasana and the person who hears him is Vismanagara, the king of Prastanagara in the island of Gawangan. It also recounts the war of the: Devas and the Asuras over Awerta, which has also been described in the Texts Paerggalaeran and in the Javanese Adiparva, According to our author, the eclipse of the Sun and the Moon was caused by Singhika and not by Rahu,.
as we see in the Mak:bh@rata. According to Juynboll, the language of the book is not different from that of the Tantus, the Koravasrama, the Kwiijparahkarna etc. We shall have occasion to discuss this work more fully later on.

The BAhuvanapuraina is an Old-Javanese work having: some corrupt Sanskrit Slokas. It describes a dialogue between Vafistha and Paramefvara, who was seated in Kailasa, about the four a�ramas and castes. It incidentally mentions the 'Mlecchas' and the Wayang players.

editor, The book was written as a text-book for a prince, who was threatened by enemy. The language of the 'book, according to Dr. Juynboll, is not very old. It states 'that king Suparkadeva of Ayodhya was once attacked by Aji Wangbang, king of Danawuhawu. Bhagavan Ratnabhimi t ok compassion on him and gave him the Ni#praya. Guided by its principles, he was able to overcome 'his enemy, the king of Danawuhawu, whose daughter Yajfiavati was subsequently carried off by him,. Suparkadeva also receives some instructions on polity from a parrot, who was no other than Raveya, the son of Bhagavan Ratnabhimi ; he was cursed by gods for throwing a nagasariflower on them. Like many Indian. books, Cod. 861 of 'this work ends with 4Ff Nitipraye parisamipta,) - Many passages of it reminds us of Kautilya's

About the nature of the ideal king, the NMifiraya says, "A good prince must protect his subjects against all unjust persecutions and oppressions and should be the light of his subjects even as the sun is the light of the world. If, on the contrary, a piince neglects to extend his banevolence and protection towards his subjects, he exposes himself to be abandoned by them, or at any rate, loses their confidence," f

About the Prime-Minister it says, "It is a disgrace to a Prime-Minister for any hostile attack to be made on the country entrusted to his charge without his knowledge or that he should be careless or inattentive to the same rather thinking how to obtain the favour of his prince than to secure the safety of the country. So it is when he does not understand how to administer the country properly, or fails to invent what is useful ; when be makes many promises, but fulfls few ; when he is, careless with regard to public affairs and talks much about what is of no consequence, seeking to be admired by the people and putting

on fair appearances when his intentions. do not correspond ; -when he cares nothing about the misfortunes of inferiors, provided be gets money himself ; when finally he is not faithful, but deceitful-such a Prime-Minister is like the hawk which soars high in the air, but descends low on the earth to seize and steal its fruit. But a good PrimeMinister is he who is upright in his heart, moderate in his fear of the prince, faithfully obedient to all his orders, kind-hearted, not oppressive to the people and always exerting himself to the utmost for the happiness of the people and the welfare of the country."

As regards the duty of the ambassador, it says : "A person entrusted with a message from his prince must never abuse his trust placed in him, but always keep in sight that on such occasion he is the representative of the Before he enters any foreign country, by some secret means or other, he occasions his own name and that of the prince his master to be spread over the at the same time he obtains every possible information regarding the state of the country and the people.
On entering the country, he must assume a cignified appearance and not speak or look about him more than is necessary. Such conduct will inspire the people with respect for him."

These wise sayings are never Machiavellian in tone, and they have found their place in every political science of the world, though in the garb of a different language. In a similar strain the Javanese says : "It is the duty of the chief of the nation to enquire into everything which can affect his subjects ; to know whether they are prosperous or not, if everyone attends to his duty, if they are skilful in the execution of it or not, and in all cases to

take nreasures accordingly, never losing sight of justice."" 1 Translated by Raffles in his 'H istory of Java,) 1830, Vol�. 1, pp. 305ff. 2 Ibid, p. 288.

It continues further : "A chief should keep his plan of: attack as secret as possible, because the knowledge of it may enable the enemy to be on his guard and turn the measures taken to his own advantage. He ought not to challenge his enemy to give battle, as in that case the.
enemy will have an opportunity of preparing himself for the same : but he should attempt to surprise him and rush upon him like a fire, that quickly and without much noise consumeth all with which it comes in contact."

The author of this book. observes quite appropriately that "the severest misfortune which a man can suffer is to be deprived by force of the land upon which he lives and.
which he has cultivated or to have his wife and children taken from him by force."

The Nitis�stra Kawi offers the highest position to holy sages -a position which is higher than that of Bhatira' Guru or even the moon. It says� "Bhatara Guru is cool, still colder is the moon ; but the: coldness of neither is to be compared to that which is instilled by the voice of a holy man."

The book runs into 123 stanzas, which have been composed in the most beautiful Kaw:z. It has been supposed that the book is co-eval with, if not older than the celebrated Bkiratayuddha, which was composed in 1157 A. D..
by Mpu Sedah. It is curious, however, that we cannot discover anyrpassamge from the Arthafgastra of Kautilya or Visnugupta in the Javanese and Balinese Niff Literature.

: subject, it can be said in passing that the style and E reasoning in some Ni��-works constantly remind us of the a poignant and virile pen of the writer of the Indian � Arthasistra. - Many passages have been handled in a f : strikingly similar fashion.

B. ]urisprudence

The earliest form of the idea of authority is belief in : 'a divinely ordained set of rules-which, in the latest form, \ emanate from the sovereign power in a politically organised f society. "The theory of the entire body of law, both religious , :and secular," says Golap Chandra Sarkar," "emanating from } the deity is maintained by Manu, whose code is admitted to g hold the highest rank among the works called Smrti. A E text of Brhaspati declares that a Smrti or rule, that is opposed to the sense of Manu's Institutes, is not approved ; since, the superiority of Manu's Code is ordained by reason of its embodying the purport of the Veda or revelation." Thus the fiction of divine origin, which is one of the characteristics of ancient Jurisprudence, has been maintained cas a distinctive feature of early Indian law-codes, About the

P primitive Hindu conception of the origin of law, we read in g; the Brhadaranyaka Upanigad,*

g "Sanatvavyabhavat tat $reyorupamatyasr;ata dharmam."

of divine origin has been maintained throughout, and Lord!
Siva has been described as the propounder of some. The Sivasisana or Purvadhigama, for example, pretends tocodify the laws propounded by Siva, As the greatest number of early Indonesian law-zodes have bsen based upon the of India, it is but natural that they should breathe the 'same Indian spirit..
Besides, in the earliest evolutionary stage of society, a fiction of this character is urgently necessary for marshalling the recalcitrant elements of society to the side of law and order-and, this has been responsible more than anything I else for the incorporation of such fiction in the earliest law- | codes of the world., Ihe Indian term Agama, which means g a Sistra handed down by the gods, and which is used! g

by the Indonesian peoples to denote their law-codes, is,. g therefore, significant. - E

As regards the date of these works we are quite in � the dark. Only the SivaSisana has bsen referred to in an f inscription of ogt A.D. ' If it be identical with the extant fa work, it must have been present in East Java during the: �; reign of Anantavikrama. With reference to the Agama E: and the Adigama, which Raffles: regards as the very g foundation of Indonesian jurisprudence, Dr. Juynboll re- [ marked that they were probably composed in the Majapahit � period. According to Dr. J. L. A. Brandes, they are f later still. The preamble of the Adigema, however, points g out that it was codified in' 1323 Saka or I40I A.D., �� by the "King of Majapahit, who honoured Buddha".~ As: �

the Agama is older still, we can probably place it fifty years earlier, he., c 1273 Saka. As regards the date of other

books, we cannot say anything more than that they are later still Co tu >. "Sf

It will appear to careful observers that in spite of:

1 Hindoe-reckt in Indoneste, p. 35. CH. VJ THE 1GAMA OF INDONESIA 95�

Indo-Javanese contact from the earliest centuries 'of theChristian era, no Hindu work on jurisprudence has yet been discovered in Java which may be dated prior to the Ifoth century A.D. The date of the earliest work extant of Java is the SivaSisana, and it falls at a time: when the Kewf-literature was just blooming forth. Indian works on Jurisprudence have been written in Sanskrit and, as this sacred tongue was not intelligible before the compromise-language - was developed, it is not very probable that any work of Indian origin would be discovered in future which may be dated before the 8th century A.D. If the theory we have enunciated in the first chapter be correct, this is the logical conclusion. We: know,� however, from extant inscriptions and records of the country that the terms of Indian polity to designate kings, ministers, etc., were greatly employed, and even the names of cities, like those of Camp@,* were already Hinduized.

The book Agama, which we have mentioned previously, also goes by the name of �uiammanava, and it was edited and discussed by Dru] ~C. G. Jonker in 1885 in his book 'Eer Oudjavaansch wetboek vergeleken met Indische rechtbronnen, ie., an old-Javanese law-book compared with.

the Manusamhita, The code enjoyed great celebrity in Indonesia, and this appears from a passage in the Sivabasana, containing the place "DAarmlaSsistrakzxtaramanavad:,""' i.e.

and allows a substantial measure of personal right for selfdefence. Some specific rules have been embodied in the 'work, which forbid peoples from lodging complaints in law-courts on particular days and directing men not to indulge in intercourse, etc.,! on certain occasions (vide Manu, chap.

The book Adigama is a more recent work and claims "to have been based upon the Riajaniti. It opens with an invocation to Lord Buddha, "om namo Buddhaya namah", 'the language, however, being a mixture of Sanskrit and 'Old-Javanese. It also speaks of estedzsta, with which Jonker's edition of the Xx{f@raminava begins, and specifies .the nature of estacorah ; some regulations with reference to cattle in pasturage, punishment according to gradation �of castes have also been set forth, Of more import: ance, however, is the Pu�rvadkigama or the Sivabisana, which we had occasion to mention previously.

The above passage shows that the book was composed by Pandit Misraharana, who has been called a vrddhacarya, rajapurohita, sarvagunajfia, crest-jewel of all peoples, etc. The corrupt phrase "Sakali-cudamani-sirasi pratisthita reminds us of similar passages in Indian books and inscriptions. The Deopara stone inscription of Vijayasena and the Madhainagara grant of Laksgmanasena% use the phrase "Koernita-kgatriyanin with reference to Samantasena. Similarly, the Khalimpur inscription says, "prakrtibhir=lakgmyah karam grahitah S?igop?la itz ksitisa-Strasam cudamanistat sutah," etc," .

Apart from literary styles and the constant use of Sanskrit, we find references to the administration of cathformulas which we also notice in many Kawzrecords of Java. Cod. 3958 (2) of this book refers to Wayang or shadowplays. It also mentions some Saiva sects like (A)lepaka, Canaka, Ratnahara, Sambhu as well as Sivapaksa.*+ - It ends with �gz'w�fismmsfzroa�d/zrzfzzsana.� ' The book wasextant in its older recension in the reign of king Anantavikrama of the Dharmmavam�a and is already referred to in an inscription of 991 a.D.5 The law-book Devigame, which forms one of the Seng Hyang Trayigama of the law-code Tativa ning Vyavahira, is also known as Kreta, Upapati, �K Dharma Upapati and Dhaymapapati� It is partly based on the Institutes of Manu (Chap.

Dewa�anda,� another book of the same category, is also known as D�crmavicira, Both the names are clearly Sanskritic-the one meaning 'sceptre of the gods,' while the other signifies 'administration of law.' It says that it has been written in old-language which, we believe, modern linguists will not deny. It states further that Visnu incarnated on earth to punish evil-doers, The title of the book appears on p. 24 of Cod. 3957.

It has been noted that the administration of oathformulas and ordeals has been. constantly referred . to in the law-codes of Java and Bali. (In many inscriptions of Java, oath has distinctly been < mentioned in. various. places.
Ordeals, which were resorted to in cases of grave offence, were believed to be efficacious in discovering the real wrong-doer, who might otherwise escape the punishments of law.. This peculiar custom was not only prevalent among the >Indo-Aryan and . Austronesian - peoples, but also among the Teutons, etc. the proximity . .of Java to India should not, therefore, be adduced. as an argument for supposing that these peculiar customs were derived from India, where ordeals and administration of oath-formulas were. frequently. resorted to.
An analysis of details will clearly demonstrate that the systems both in India as well as in Indonesia were of indigenous growth. Before we work out our hypothesis, it is perhaps necessary to point out that the picture of the casteridden Indian society was fully represented in Bali, where

there were the Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaifyas and Sudras

As in India, so also in Indonesia, the

witnesses who gave evidence on oath, were asked to appear at a temple (in the presence of Brihmanas-Manu). The oath which was administered in the temples was called Madeva-Sakgi by the Balinese peoples, the phrase MadevaSiksi being probably derived from: Mahadeva-Saksi, z.�.' Lord Siva is a witness. When both the parties were concerned, this process of oath-administration was called Madevagama, which, we think, may mean either 'the law of Lord Siva' or 'a visit to Lord Siva.
__ Now, the Manusamkiti states} that in administering oaths, one should say "Tell" to the Brahmanas, "Tell the \ truth" to the Ksatriyas, "Swear by cow, seed and gold" to the Vaisyas" .and, "Swear by all your sins" to the Sadras,.
In the case of the Sudras, however, Manzxsamhiti also recommends a separate procedure. It states that the Sudras may also be tested by fire or water-ordeal, or by making. them touch the head of their wives and sons. If they are not burnt by fire or soon floated by water," then the veracity of their oaths may be taken for granted.� . It will appear from this description that, though temple-going is a common feature of early Indian and Indonesian system of administering oaths, details in. connexion with the process do not agree. It must be admitted, however, that the same spirit has been maintained in. the Indian as well as the Indonesian law-codes. Manu does not explicitly state anywhere if oath-water was a necessity in ancient Indian courts. | � In the Hindu law - of ewdence, women, though excluded as a gene1a1 rule, were allowed to appear in

a In Balinese law-courts, they were allowed to appear as legal witnesses, In this respect, Indonesian women seemed to stand on a higher plane than their Indian sisters, In respect of undesirable intercourse, however, between persons of different sexes, Indonesian law-codes seem to be equally stringent with 'their Indian counter-parts, By article 242 of the Agama," if a man of comparatively lower standing is illegally united with a woman of the higher rank, he must be killed.

| than killing a Brihmana, The king should not, therefore, I think of passing a capital sentence on the Brahmagas even } in dream ! Similar is the tenor of the Balinese Jurisprudence.t Art. 245 of the Agema, however, mentions a case in which a Brihmana may be killed without being tortured.
This reminds us of the only reference in Kautilya, who g recommends the king to drown a Brahmana accused of | high treason.2 One, interesting fact to be noticed in this | connexion is that 'the fine depends, as in early Indian law-codes, upon the position of the injured one in the social scale. In killing a Sudra-thief, for example, one is fined 40,000 kempengs till we rise to 160,000 for killing a Brahmana-thief. According to the Agame, this is the maximum fine. In the Devedaenda, as well as in | other works, caste-considerations have been given undue prominence, and they have greatly vitiated the ideals : of law and justice. Some regulations with reference to slaves, lending of gold or money, keeping ferocious dogs that bite others, cutting out dykes of fields, etc., have been dealt with in the law-code called Devedanda. As regards inheritance, where a Brahmana has sons by wives of different castes, the law of Bali seems to follow, though in spirit only, some of the regulations laid down by Because, though the wives' verna is a determining factor in both, the details do not concur.
S@rasamuccaya is also a law-book, in which we come - across a large number of Sanskrit Slokas followed by an OldJavanese translation, According to Dr. J. L, A. Brandes, this work is identical with Redja Manusamhita, Harivam�e and some other books of Indian origin have supplied the main legal theories of this interesting work.

Cod. 3852 (10) of this book opens with an anecdote of Visnu, who goes to rule over Medang under the assumed name of Tawkandyiawan and begot four sons, viz., Mangukuhan, Karungkalah, - Sandagarbha and Katumalars.� - While discussing Cod. 4469 of this work, Dr. Juynboll pointed out that some of its verses were derived from VII, 97 ; I, 88 ; X, 4. etc., of the Manzxsamhita, 4245th verse of the Hartvamie, verses 1558, 1559, 1560 of the Udyogaparvan, 296th verse of the ASvamedhikaparvan, etc.?

With this, we bring our discussion on Indo-Javanese Jurisprudence to a close, The survey which we have made above has probably demonstrated the great kinship of the ManavadharmaSistra to the legal literature of Java and Bali. The fiction of divine origin has been strengthened further by the maintenance of Sanskrit glokas in the lawcodes: of Indonesia. It ought to be remembered, however, that the laws of adoption and inheritance are somewhat different in Java and Bali. Similarly, divorce and re_ marriage of women, which are not generally countenanced by Hindu law, make a substantial departure from Indian lawcodes, It is painful to think, however, that the Indian colonists of Java and Bali, who gave a newer orientation to every form of Indonesian culture, did not show, at least there is no proof that they did show, any aptitude for bettering the conditions of the Javanese and the Balinese women in the eyes of law. It is quite true that the Indian Jurisprudence of ancient times could not rise in this respect to the height of the Egyptian law-codes, or even the Code of Hammurabi. Still the colonists, who had adapted themselves to the peculiar environment of the Javanese society, could have dt least tried to improve the position of Indonesian women;, with whom they must have come into contact in different walks of life, The probable reason for this passivity, we:

1 Vide Suppl. Cat. Jay. en Mad. HSS, di II, p. 198.
2 Ibid, p. 276.

CH, VJ THE AGAMA OF INDONESIA og.

think, is that the position of Indonesian women, though not very high, was at least similar to, or a little better than that of their Indian sisters. Indian jurists of Java and Bali, who were imbued with the ideals of the Manusamhita, could not easily get rid of those obnoxious legal theories of ancient times. A general review of the earlier portions of the ninth chapter in the Manusamhita would clearly demonstrate the actual position of women in the classical period of India's history. People who viewed women in this light could hardly improve their position elsewhere. It is, therefore, no wonder that the Nit�istra-kaw? of Java lays down in a similar tone, "'For the saying is : that a raven can sooner turn white and the tafijang-plant (water-lily) grow from a rocky place than a woman can be upright." This vilification of womanhood throws a lurid light on the early Indo-Javanese Jurisprudence, which was evolved to suit the requirements of this peculiarly-constituted society. It has to be further observed that the law-codes of Java and Bali, like those of India, do not betray any democratic outlook.
The sanctity of Brahmanism and caste-theories has been a stumbling-block in the way of meting out equal justice to all, But, as these factors were the legacy of. earlier times, peoples had to submit to these harsh regulations without any apparent demur. - Barring all these obvious difficulties in the way of awarding equal justice to all, the purity of Daendaenit? was maintained throughout. Indeed Lod 3796 in Juynboll's supplement says :�Yo narah pidayet (read, pidayed) rajna dandyo (read,.
dandah) so (read, sa) na kadacana"

CHAPTER VI WARIGA AND CONNECTED LITERATURE

We shall discuss this branch of literature under three sub-divisions, viz., (a) Grammar, Lexicography, Prosody and Rhetoric, (0) Usada (Medical Science) and Wariga (Astrology or Astronomy), and (c) Cosmogony and Mythology or Mythical Chronology. The grandeur of the Javanese epic literature generally arrests the attention of average readers, who are apt to forget that the creation of the main structure has been possible for its secure foun dation on the forms of Sanskrit Grammar',Lexicography, Prosody and Rhetoric, which, along with the national tradition of India, have

served as an inexhaustible quarry to the classical writers of the Indo-Javanese period. These elements, though exotic, were at the root of the sudden efflorescence of the Kawiliterature of Java, - An analysis of these foreign forms in the Old-Javanese literature will, therefore, enable us to gauge the depth of Indian cultural influence on the islands of Java and Bali, and enable us to assess the real value of the Indo-Javanese literature, which has appeared to be, more or less, a facsimile of that of India.
& Indeed, an examination will show that the Javanese " writers were no less proficient than Sanskrit authors in the handling of Sanskrit Chandah and Alarik@ra. - Some works on Metrics, like those on Grammar, Lexicography, Usada and Wariga, have escaped the ravages of time.
These were doubtless supplemented by some works on Alank@ra (Rhetoric), but at this distance of date no vestiges of them have remained behind except what we can painfully glean from the themselves. They betray a

marvellous knowledge of Sanskrit Rhetoric, used with a good amount of success, and hence, they raise a presump tion about the wide prevalence of the rules of Sanskrit . Alanka@ra in the writings of the Indo-Javanese authors.
Some of the writers undertook to edit Vocabulary or Lexicography of Sanskrit, and some even went so far as to write Sanskrit-Javanese grammars. Indeed, the Kaw: authors of the classical period had sometimes to perform the double function of a school-master and a poet, and there are records to show that some writers were both?w� With these preliminary remarks, let us now pass into the subject proper, which we propose to open with a review of

group (c).

(a) Grammar, Lexicography, Prosody and Rhetoric

In the group of Indo-Javanese Grammatical and Lexicographical literature, we fortunately possess some works.
Of them, especial importance attaches to the Ehkalavya, EKrtavasa, Sukzavasa, Cantakaparva and the Svaravyahjana. - The last-mentioned work is an avowed Sanskrit-Javanese - Grammar, though Kryfavease and Cod.

3895 (1) in Juynboll's Supplement also offer some interesting grammatical rules,

The Svaeravyafijana'* is divided into two parts. The first part deals with the vowels and the consonants the svaras and the vyafijanas. The second part deals with conjugation and Sanskrit composition. The work offers some interesting Sandhi-rules, In the list of vowels, which it offers, we find only a, &, e, #, 7, l, e ( as in Eng. "mess), at, 0, ah, om ;the corresponding long sounds of these vowels have not found place in the list, Dr. Juynboll thinks, however, that the omitted letters might have been

present in the original of this MS*!,. Cod. 3896 (1) also speaks of the anusvaras and the vyafijanas,.

In the list of consonants, 2%40�, cke, jha, the, dha have been omitted, .and there has been some confusion over the placing of the three s's. In Sanskrit, we have 8,8, s ; but bere, s has been accommodated before & and s. It':should be noted, however, that the order of all letters-vowels as well as consonants-is perfect in the Mahayanist work, the Sang Hyang Kamahayanitan�, which, in its present form, probably existed in the toth century A.D.

The short sounds (eg., a, e, etc.); are said to be 'ckamiatra', and the long ones (eg., a), 'dvimiatra', 2.6, one syllabic instant is allotted to a short vowel and two to a long vowel, The double sounds (e.g., ef, ah, etc.), unlike Sanskrit, are known as 'trimitra' The vyafijanas, 'on the other hand, have been divided into �ghoe�,� 'anunssika', 'antasvara,' etc. Further, our author speaks of 'udantya' {evidently a corruption of 'uditta') and 'anudantya' (7.4, anudatta) varnas. The svaras or vowels are again constdered in two broad divisions, wis.-dirgha ze. gurx and laghz, te., short; while the vyafijanas come under the headings of 'miurddhanya' (cerebral), 'talavya' (palatal) 'dantya' (dental) 'mahaprapa' and 'alpaprina' We miss here 'austhya' and 'jihvamiliya' The Javanese people, obviously,understood these technical terms, and this appears from the explanations they have offered, eg., 'mfaurddhanya' has been explained as ikeng aksara m�dal ing Sira, etc., i.e., the sound of the letter originating from the head {(=miurddha).*

{f Now we come across Sandhi-rules, The writer says : 'Tkang ikara dadi ya', te, V should be changed into 'y', and he has offered some illustrations thereof, from which

we select only ai+am=ayam, . According to the Sanskrit rule," it should have been a@yam. The other rules are, 'ukara dadi wa',i.e,'w should be 'w', and the example he gives, viz., ba exactly fits. in with the Sanskrit rule, by which we have tested the previous example, Further, he says that if the. vowel 'a' is followed by 'u', _ they will compound into '0',, and the example he c1tes in illustration thereof is, no doubt, very mtezestmg Because it is no other than our much too fam111ar example of 'Gangodaka' (=Ganga + Udaka), * which we used to read in schools. After the svara-sandhi, we come across the vyaflijana and the visarga-sandhi. They have also been explained in the above manner and, therefore, we do not think it necessary to offer any more example, A work of similar nature has also been referred to in Cod. 3173 (1) of Juynboll's Supplements, where we notice the Nga/lemat Serat Sandhai Sesiraq; in Prof, Vreede's Catalogue*t also, we came across one Serat Sandi Sutra.� #3 __ The second part of the Svamwymyazmz is called Krtavasa */ (arobably a corruptlon from 'Samskrta bhag2'), and it has sought to give some instructions on Sanskrit composition.
It begins with- : tz� <3 Sah vrksa1�1Lang kayu ' Sah vrksah tisthati=lagi yah .

In the second example, the author has not translated the first two words, as they have been rendered before into Javanese, and he thought that the translation of Esthati was enough for conveying the sense. It is almqst SI}1�1_11_21-1�_ to the

This probably necessitated their incorporation in this dictionary to the exclusion of many other deities,.
;; We should note in this connexion that Naiyayikadarsana and Nyaya Sastra have also been referred to in 'Kawi-Oorkonden', Nos. lxviii, lxxxiii.

Now that we have dxscuss'ed the Grammar and Lexicography of Indo-Javanese origin, we may proceed with the Prosody. and Rhetoric of these islands and try to find out Sanskrit elements in their forms, But before we take up the subject proper, we shall make some general observations.
on Indo-Javanese Chandah and Alank@ra, Itis interesting.
to note that our Javanese authors have carefully followed the dictum of Sanskrit critics, which may be expressed in the language of Vi�vanitha Kaviraja: 'Adasx namaskriydsir va vastunirdesa eva o@. Accordingly many works of the classical period of Indo-Javanese history open with a phrase of benediction, generally with, 'on: avighnam astw', which is sometimes followed by salutation to Siva, Sara: svati,. Buddha, GaneSa, or other deities, 'The introductory portions of the B�uvanakoga and the Bhnuvanasamisepa, to name only two books out of many, may illustrate the point, enabling us to compare them with similar portions of the Raghuvambam, the M udrauraksasam, etc. This will serve to show a strange communion in the literary ideals of the 'Indo-Javanese authors, who have not infrequently intro-� 'duced this practice towards the closing portion of their works. The Javanese Krgnintaka, the Sivabisana, the Sang > Hya?a Hayu, the Vrati�isana may be adduced to illustrate the point. To offer a description of the poet and his family was. also a custom widely prevalent among the classical | �jwnters of India and Java. The Nigaerakrtigama of Pra-, j

pafica, the Arjmnavivika of Mpu Kanva, the Situpalavadham of Magha, the Hargacaritam of Bana are quite good examples.

In writing works in Kaw#poesy or Kakawin, the writers of old Java have drawn upon the vast resources of the Sanskrit literature, and have sought to beautify their works with a lavish use of Indian Chandah and Alanka@ra, Metres like Sragdhara, Tristubh, Rucira, Vasantatilaka, Manda krant3, etc., have been judiciously used to enhance the grace of their compositions, and Sanskrit Alank@ras like Anuprasa, Yamaka, Apahnuti, etc., have added an additional lustre to their Indianised literature. - Reserving the subject for a more adequate treatment later on, it may be said in passing that though the Javanese authors have generally observed the rule, "Ekavpritamayath Padyaih",} they have done so at the sacrifice of the remaining portion of the dictum, viz., 'Avasine nyavritahkath, both of which have been usually followed in Sanskrit, Let us now pass into the subject proper.,

._ The well-known work on Prosody, the or Collection of Metres, was edited by Dr. Friederich about 82 years ago.2 In an introduction to this work, he observed that the book is of Indian origin, containing versus memoriales, which are something like short Panini slitras intended for committing those rules to memory, and that the work has been written partly in Sanskrit and partly in Polynesian Kawi, This book further mentions a treatise on metrics, called Prgalakoga, which would naturally remind us of the Sanskrit Pimgalacchandahsuira of India, The Ptiigalakoga served as a model to our author, Mpu Tanakung, and he based his work on this book of Sage Pingala, who, as

tradition says, held discourses in the guise of a naga.
As the titles of Prtigalakoge and seem to be near-related, one may conjecture that these two works on Prosody are identical, But the result of a comparative study of the Frffas@ficayc, instituted by Dr. Kern, with the Sanskrit Prngalacckandahsuira and Kediara's Viritaratnikara, has not borne any positive fruit,-no valuable relationship has been established among these works of Indo-Javanese versification.* Though we do not obtain much result from this point of view, our conclusion on the subject is not barren at all. Indeed, Kern points out that for an adequate appreciation of Sanskrit metrics, it is necessary to have a sound grasp of the main principles of Kawi-Prosody, and this is no small gain to the literary history of ancient India, It should be remembered, however, that the book merely offers an exposition of 'Vrttas' ; 'Matrachandah' and 'Ganachandalh' have found no place in this Old-Javanese work on Prosody.

In the theoretical part of the Fri#eseficaya, the author sums up the names of the classes of metres, which begin with strophes extending from 4 % 1 feet to 4 x 27 feet. Mere theories are described in strophes from 3-8, while the practical part or mode?} strophes run from 9-108. Of these 100 strophes, 104, 105, 106 and 107 being examples of metres discussed in the earlier part of the work, we practically find here only 96 pure Indian Chandahs. The author has devoted some space for Dandaka, which is almost half-prose and half.
poetry, It is no wonder, therefore, that in spite of proper thyme at the end of verses, the Dandaka hears almost a prose composition. In the place of 96 pure Indian Chandahs of the Viritasaficaya, we get only 85 in Cod. 5109 According to Dr. Juynboll, the measures in the Cantakaparva� also

materially differ from those in Tanakung's Vriftrseficaya.
In the Middle-Javanese literature of the Kidung-class, we come across some examples of an entirely different kind of Chandah, eg., the Macapat metre, the Tengahan metre and so forth,. a g

We know from the book itself! that the writer < of this Kaw#-work was Mpu Tanakung. Though it has | been surmised by some scholars that the second name of ( our author was Cakravaka, it is not easy to record one's



� opinion on this point. Because, the colophon, which �3? mentions his name, is not explicit, and it runs as follows :f "It Viritasaficaya || Cakravakadutacarita || Tanakung |"

g The literal meaning of the relevant phrase would be,

| 'History of the Duck-messenger'. Though the phrase certainly reminds one of the name of Kalidasa's immortal Meghaduiam, the propriety of introducing the phrase here will always be questioned by scientific investigators.
The date of this interesting Kaw#-work is inter-linked with the problems of the Old-Javanese R&amayanae, thus furnishing a most perplexing Gordian knot in the field of literature.
We, therefore, reserve this point for discussion later on, where we shall consider not only the date of the OldJavanese Rimayana, but also the date of the Lubdhaka and the Smeradahana, which, on account of tradition and internal evidences, have yielded one of the most vexed problems of Indo-Javanese literature. +, It would be a great mistake, however, to regard these "" works as a mere theoretical exposition of the Indian metres.
If we analyse the 6th song of the Old-Javanese Ramayana of Yogifvara, we find, for example, that the first 18 strophes of this song have been tried in Upendravajra ; strophes nos. 19-26 in Sardala ; 27 in Aupacchandasika ; 28-63 in Malini ; 64-1 13 in Anusftubh ; 114-141 in Candravarta ; 142-159 in Vasantatilaka ; 160-171 in Sikharirpi; 172-195 in Upajati ; 195 in Indravajra ; 198 in Upendravajra ; 199-200 in a kind of Dhrti ; 201-203 in Mattamayira, Similarly, song no. 44 of

the Nigarakrtigaima has been tried in Suvadani ; 45 in a kind of Krti ; 46 in Sarddlavikridita ; 47 in Vasantatilaka and so forth. We have taken here a few examples at random, and it is not difficult to multiply such instances. Let us scan one strophe to see the working method of an Indian Chandah in relation to Old-Javanese poesy or Kawi.

Take, for example, the following instance in Bhujangaprayita, which, as is well-known, is expressed by the rule Bhujangaprayatam caturbhir yakaraih. To use the symbols of scansion,

From what we have said before, it would appear that the Javanese authors were no less proficient than Sanskrit writers in the handling of various Chandahs, which, as we have seen, are derived from India.: It is not much known, that the Kawi-writers were equally at home in Sanskrit Rhetoric, called Alankara, i., ornament or embellishment; In the following few lines, we shall 'try to measure the success they attained in the , .. 1.

use of Indian Rhetoric. Because, no poet, however great, can do away with Alanka@ra or grace, which lends additional charm to his composition. Every poet, therefore, seeks to bring in a harmony of symphony and style. When a word-magician, for example, writes : 'Ra;ani Sefien ghana, ghana deya garajana rimithimt varige? he naturally tries to arrange- his words in such a way that the read ing of the verse immediately brings out in a most exquisite form the picture of a rain-drained sky in the month of July 'to the reader's imagination.* So sweetness, word-play and imagination-drill are the very soul of poetry. Let us see, how our have fared in respect of judiciously using various forms of Sanskrit Rhetoric like Anuprasa,

VYamaka, Apahnuti, Upami, Riupaka and so forth for enhancing the grace of their works.

About Anuprasa, Dandin says :"Varnavrttir anupriasah padegu ca padegu ca

Pirvanubhava-samski@ra-bodbini yadyadurata."*

Fhe repetition of like letter or syllable, which is the characteristic of Sanskrit Anuprasa, is not an uncommon feature in Indo-Javanese Kavyas. � Fhough many poets, Indian as well as Javanese, have shught to cover their poverty of imagination with the brilliance of letter-play, 't has still produced a great effect in the hands of masterartists, Vi��vanitha Kaviraja has furnished some brilliant

examples in his SZZifyeaderpenam,} of which we select a couplet from Chekanuprasa.

It will be observed that this form also recalls some characteristic structure of versification in Old English and other Teutonic languages, Be it noted, however, that the rules of Indo-Javanese Anuprasa do not necessarily adhere to those of English alliteration, though they may be grouped together in a general way. In the above example, die and ka furnish illustrations of Sanskrit Anuprasa.

Kawi-writers of Java have also made an extensive use of this form of Alank&@ra. Yogi�vara, the celebrated author: of the Old-Javanese Rim:ayana, writes} :"Bika Suci Suddha Saiva Sira Satvikasinta," etc.

The above example, amongst others, tends to show the diffusion of knowledge of Sanskrit Rhetoric among some Kawi-writers, - The above instance has been selected at random, so also the following from Mpu Dharmaja, who composed the beautiful Kakawin Smaradazana :"Akrak tan katahen tangisnira tumon tunwan smaraweh sekel"?
We quote a different example from Prapafica, who flourished towards the second half of the 14th century A.D. Theperfect form of his Anuprasa would make us believe that this Alanikara had not fallen into desuetude during his time, He says :"Prapafica pracacah pafica, pracacad pocapan ceced Prapongpong pipi pucche prem, pracongcong cet pacehpaceh

It is apparently one of the most perfect examples of Yamaka in all Kaw#-literature, The pairs of 'rembang', 'kajar', 'sung', 'gung' and 'syok' occurring at different points of the above example, may remind one of the definition of Dandin though 'this is not a clear case of Sanskrit Yamaka, The earlier portion of the second verse may also be considered as an example of Sanskrit Anuprisa, A variety of VYamaka known'to critics is Saridasta Yamaka, which begins every foot with the last words of the previous foot.

In the foregoing example, 'madenasa' 'na yojita,' and 'gatipi ta' in the second, third and the last feet have respectively been taken from the closing portion of the previous relevant foot. Itis a pleasant surprise to us to learn that even this variety of the VYamaka was known to Yogigvara, the writer of the Old-Javanese Rimi@yana, who has offered us the following example, And, the sample furnished by Jogifsvara is, we believe, more perfect than the one we have �quoted before.

If having given expression to some secret object, one construes his meaning differently, either by paronomesia.

An interesting example has been given in the darpanam * "Kale varidharinim apatitaya naiva Sakyate sthatum Utkanthitasi tarale! - na hi na hi Sakhi! picchilah panthah" It may be translated thus: In the season of clouds, it is impossible to remain without a husband (or without falling, both of which may be translated by apaftitaya ).
'Art thou agitated, fickle girl ?" 'No, no, dear friend, the way is slippery'. � Here apatitaya has been construed differently to suit �different occasions. Such form enhances grace and brings in a mixed touch of humour and romanticism. , From the same work of Yogifvara from which we have quoted

dency in human mind to draw analogy from objects of similar nature to enhance the suggestiveness of ideas, When Shelley, for example, wrote the exquisite verse, "Make me thy lyre even as the forest is" ('Ode to the West Wind'),.
we are to think that the comparison was born in the post's imagination. Javanese authors have sometimes compared bamboo-trees with flutes ; because, when wild wind passes through the bamboo-trees, they seem to produce the melody of flutes or lyres. Kalidasa,* similarly, writes :Yah purayan kicalkarandhrabhagan, Darimukhotthena samiranena | Udgasyatamicchati kinnaranam Tanapradayitvamivopagantum" || (Gusts of winds coming out of mountain-caves are producing murmuring melodies in the holes of bamboo-reeds,.
and, it appears therefrom that the Himalayas are timing with the tunes of the 'full throated' Afuzaris).
In some of the most beautiful poems of Rabindranath Tagore, the idea has found an exquisite expression.
Compare, for example,

"Aji roder prakhar tape, Bafidher jale alo kanpe, Vatas viaje marmariya, Sarivadha taler vane" This may be rendered in the following manner :'The mid-day heat is keen,

The light shimmers on the lake, And the wind spreads murmur Along the row of tal'.

The central idea of it, however, has found an equally fine expression in the following verses of the 'varsamangala' :-.

1 Kalidasa, Kumarasambhavam 1/8; cf. also, Bharatayuddha,.

50/5; Vrittasaficaya, 98.

CH, VI] - WARIGA AND CONNECTED LITERATURE 1235

"Duliche pavane fan fan vanavithika Gitamay taru-latika" �. �. 'The forest sways in the wind, And trees flutter in leafy music'.

Now, all these poets of East and West have given expression to the same idea by drawing a comparison between 'tree' and 'lyre'. It will not serve the purpose of higher criticism if we precipitately enunciate that one has borrowed from the other. Judging the question from this point of view, we shall not perhaps obtain much valuable result from our attempt to discover parallel Upami4, Rupaka, Utpreksa, etc., from Indo-Javanese literature, Still a presumption is raised that, as Kaw#-writers have enormously borrowed from Sanskrit literature, they might as well have obtained these forms of Alanka@ra from the same Indian source, With these words in our mind, let us now study this particular branch of Indo-Javanese Rhetoric.

Let us begin with some examples of Simile and Metaphor. Mpu Sedah, the celebrated writer of the PBAGratayuddha, who composed it in 1157 A. D., writes :

"Uruk warnant wandirania kadi soka makemoli ping gal ling pria." "} ["Sad looked her fig-tree, like unto a sorrowful wife separated from her husband"].
The above specimen will certainly remind us of a host of parallels in Sanskrit literature. Kalidasa, for example,

while describing the Winter-season in his Rfusem/zairam, �offers us the following parallel :"Then the Priyangu creeper, reaching maturity,

Grows paler, O Beloved, Like a lonely maiden from her lover parted."

The central idea of these two passages also occurs in

the Raghuvam�am', Rainuvali,"* Meghadutam," and some other works of ancient India,. Indian and Javanese authors have not stopped here. They seem to have a special fasci.
nation for the lovely eyebrows of maidens, which they have frequently described as a bow, - Mpu for

example, wrote ;"Y our fine eye-brows are your bow,

Your eye-lashes are the feathers of arrows,"

Kalidasa, who is credited with the authorship of the Sr?gz�iraz�z'la�am, writes in the same strain :

"Her brow is like the bow he bends, The side-long glances are his darts." "

fim?arly, dew-drops have been compared to the flow of tears in the Rimiyana� of Yogifvara, and this may remind us of "Ni�@tusa@rair nayani'mbukalpaihm� in the Bhattikivyam, - The former work' also describes that the king is Kelpavrksge (=wishing-tree), which has again been repeated in the Tanis Panggelaran� with respect to the mother of Kumira. In addition to these, many examples may be cited from Kawi and Sanskrit literature toillustrate how women of good grace have been compared.

It is, no doubt, one of the most beautiful examples of 'Sam�ayopama' in all Kaeww#-literature.

again notice striking similarity. Take, for example, the.

Such lovely women are also noticed in a large number of Sanskrit works including Meghedutam,*~ Raghnvam�am,* Malavikagnimitram,* - Kumarasambhavam,* - Ratnuvali,� Gitagovindam*� and a host of other works,

We thus come to the end of our discussion on the Rhetoric and Prosody of Ancient Java. It will appear from what we have said above that the Kew#f-writers were equally proficient in both these forms of literary grace or outward embellishments. There is no proof, however, that they had ever penetrated into the depth of Sanskrit poetics and delighted in literary criticism and aesthetic "appreciation of @d�veant, rasa, the processes for the realisation of that rasa, and so on, They have not discussed aoge, guna and styles of literary forms, which are the aims of higher criticism in literature. What is the reason for that? Are the books lost, or were the poets merely satisfied with the: superficial forms of Sanskrit literature, thus neglecting one of its most interesting aspects? They were, no doubt, imbued with the culture of classical India ; but where is.
the spirit that enables one to probe into the nature of the thing? We confess, the materials: extant in.
Java on this point are. too insufficient to enable us.
to form our judgment,.

With this review, we now pass on. to consider: Usada and Wariga, i.e.. the Medical and the Astrological literature - of Java and Bali, which are no less interesting than Grammar, Lexicography, Rhetoric and Prosody. .

(B) Usada and Wariga

The Usadae or Medical Science was developed to counteract diseases that came, according to Greek Mythology, from Pandora's box. The Indians and the Indonesians, of course, did not possess that wonderful box, but they had their diseases, and so the Medical Science had to be developed. The earliest reference to it in Indian literature is to be met with in the Rgveda,* where a verse depicts Rudra as a good physician : 'BAisaktamam tut bhigazim &rnom:,/ i.e., 'I hear thou art thse best of physicians' In Caraka and Sugruta, two early works on Indian Medicine, Brahma@ has been described as the propounder of the Medical Science. Indeed, the Aw�rutasaemhitt� clearly states, "First of all, Brahmi narrated this Veda ; Daksa learnt it from him. The Afgvin twins, who taught Indra, derived the Science from Daksa. I myself have learnt it from Indra." It was such an old science at the time of Caraka (s. 200 &a.D.) and Susruta (c. 400 A.D.) that these writers sought to trace the Science to the gods themselves, nay even venerated it as a Veda. , It is regrettable.
however, that we do not know who is the promulgator of the \ Indonesian Medical Science ; because, being fragmentary in its character, it has left behind no _ trustworthy evidence on this point. One peculiarity of early Indian treatises on Medicine is that they do not open with any invocation to any deity-a custom invariable in extant Javanese and later Indian compilations on the subject. Though the Javanese codices do not betray close relationship with early Indian medical works. they have some points of agreement with the early Babylonian, Syriac and late ~Hebrew . medical texts, which frequently mention. the drugs, but their employment is entirely subservient to the word of power and the

knowle�ge of a personal 'devil',"! Prayers are sometimes enjoined by Hindu writers, but charms and incantations do not occur. Common peoples and quack-doctors, however, have sy�t�matically employed charms for curing different kinds of diseases not only in India, but also in - Java and Bali. These practices, though absent in early Hindu treatises on Medicine, are not altogether absent in Old-Javanese works on the subject. This process of curing venous diseases may be elaborated in the following manner.
liftst of all, the so-called doctors utter some charms of un- intelligible. or halfiintelligible meaning over - some medicine (!) which has been prepared before, and invoke deities to lend additional force to their sedatives, sometimes threatening the deities if the disease is. not cured. When 'the medicine has thus been prepared, it is swallowed or 'otherwise used by the patient. . �14: will thus appear that, while the Javanese treatises do not betray scientific thoroughness like their Indian counterparts, they bave some points of agreement with the ill-advised processes of Indian quack.-doctors, As geographical distance leaves out the question of West-Asiatic influence on Old-Javanese medical science, we are confronted with the question: Was the science (!) then derived from the pernicious practice of local Indian colonists, who might be suspected of importing - it from India to Java ? The science of Healingy;y~in all ancient countries, began with indigenous attempt, however crude or unscientific that might be. And, therefore, it would be too hazardous for us 'to assirime that the OldJavanese medical science was 'the'gift of the superstitious colonists of 'India, though 'it is 'quite possible that the native practices were considerably modified and influenced by the immigrants from 'India: 'Our't�marks, we believe, will be amply borne out by trie internal �evidence.

It contains mantras or charms, called Memantranins, which have been written in Kawi or Old-Javanese, though the import of them-as is quite natural-cannot be comprehended by modern therapeutics. The process is that after the mentioning of sickness, a charm, beginning with the Indian formula Om is read over the mixtures of Gamugan, Kencur, Pala, Jahe, Musi, Ketan and Gajib, and the mixtures are then swallowed. It is strikingly similar to the process of the supersti- .

We now propose to study the Wariga, which we use here in a broader sense to include Astronomy and Astrology. The importance of this subject was well-recognised in ancient Java, and the ethical book Raye Kapa Kapa says : "It is incumbent upon every man of condition . . . . . to know to count years, months, days, and comprehend the Sangkila (ie. Candrasamkala) and the Kawi#-language." It may, therefore, be of some interest to know the traditional history of the origin of Wariga in Java and Bali, and what it contains.

According to the priests of Bulebug, the author of this Waeriga was Sang Yang Licin.s The kernel of the story is contained in the Sanskrit Makabkirata, and the history of the importation of this science has been traced to India, A summary of this tradition*t may be stated in the following manner :Metapa, the father of Bhagavin Semiti, as the story tells us, was once absorbed in deep meditation on a certain hill, On one occasion, Prabu Parikesit (�.e., Prabhu Pari1 According to the 'New History of the T'ang dynasty (618-906 A.D.), peoples of contemporary Java were acquainted with letters and Astronomy, But we have no positive data for holding that they had literature on them.

As the hermit was absorbed in deep -meditation, he could not offer any answer to his queries, and the king, being angry, threw a snake about his neck and went off to the capital. The snake, who was no other than the ziga Taksaka, thus roughly handled, 'resolved to teach the Prabu a good lesson, and immediately set forth on his trek. The Prabu, informed of the naga s design, made elaborate preparations for the safety of his own person and interrogated the surrounding high-priests {(ida's gade) about the probable time of the snake's arrival The priests consulted their Wariga and referred to a particular moment when the snake might be expected to come ; but unfortunately the prediction failed. The thing was that the ziga Taksaka had seen through their - elaborate preparations and realised that his attempt would be frustrated if he went there in his own form,. Not knowing what .to do, the xige went to the Sapta-patala to confer 'with Anantabhoga, the king of dragons, The latter ~concealed the ziaga in a Jambu-fruit and, himself adopting 'the guise of a high-priest, proceeded forthwith to meet 'the Prabu. Seeing the unknown ascetic, the Prabu asked him who he was and what was his business. The ascetic said in reply that he was a Brihmana ; he had come down from the hills to pay his respects to His Majesty by offering ifruit and blessings. The Prabu, finding a delightful fragrance, took the fruit to his mouth and was immediately bitten by - Taksaka and he succumbed consequently.
Janamejaya, father of Parikesit (!), was very angry with the priests, as they could not predict rightly, and he ordered their worthless Warige to be burnt by fire. It was immediately carried out, though a gust of wind carried off some pages of their Wariga to the island of Bali.

We are to note here only the name and number �of the stars. With this, we bring our study of the Wariga literature to a close, It may incidentally be mentioned that the Balinese Wariga literatme also knows one Garga, who has been described as a great astronomer. India also recognises him as the son of Vitatha, and he enjoyed great popularity as an authoritative exponent of the Astronomical Science, Heis thus a connecting link between the Astrological Science of India and Indonesia, and is an additional evidence of the fact that the Wariga literature of Java and Bali has been derived from Indian sources, which, as we have seen before, has been suggested by the Makab/karata� story and internal evidence of literature bearing on the subject.

C. Cosmogony or Mythology and Mythical Chronology

Dr. Kern remarks quite appropriately that the stories of �creation belong to the literature of the oldest gerre. The Brahmandapurina, Bhuvanakosa, Bhuvanasamkgsepa, Tantu \ Panggelaran, Manik Maya and the Tattva Sawnng offer a graphic description of the creation-story. The Catzy_palesopadesa and the Adipurana also offer valuable data for

mythological and ecclesiastical studies, In the present section,.
we shall give a somewhat detailed account of the Taxi Panggelaran, Manik Maya, Tativa Sawang Suwung and.
the Addipurina, We shall begin with the most important of these works, viz., the Taeniu Panggelaran, which is a veritable repository of cosmogony, mythology and church= history. It has no central plot like that of the Kwfizjarakarna, nor does it, like the latter one, expound ethics of a particular church. It has to be noted again that this work primarily deals with ecclesiastical affairs ; mythological and cosmogonical portions have absorbed a minor part of the work.
The book contains seven chapters in all, and they may be summarised + in the following manner :The first chapter opens with the creation-story. It states: that in the good old days, there were neither men nor Mahameru in Java. Jagatpramia@na sent Brahma and Visnu for creating men, who were made in the image of God,. Men began to multiply rapidly, but they had neither house to live in, nor dress to put on,. So, Maha-k@rana sent Brahmi, Vi�vakarma, Isvara, Visqu, Mahadeva, Ciptagupta ( apparently a corruption of Citragupta ), and Ciptanigakara ( #. e.
'citrakara' or artists ) to procure amenities. of life to the: peoples of Java, Thus, houses sprang up in many places

- and ultimately the kingdom of Medang-kamulan was founded. became instructor in words, dafagila and paficafikha and received the title of Gurudefa. The kingdom known as Medanggana was founded by Visgqu and Sr1,.
of whom the former assumed the tit'e of Kandyawan, and

. begot five sons through his wile Sri. Of these five sons, Vitti Kandyawan was consecrated to the throne. �

While trying to replace the Mount in Java, the gods assumed various forms. Vigqu, for examp'e, coiled round the Mount

as a snake, while Brahmi became the king of tortoises, Vayu placed himself on the back of the tortoise. In this

way, the huge mass of the Mount was dragged to the island, The whole world screamed at this supreme effort of the gods.

Paramef�vara saw that and, himself drinking a quantity of it, became Nilakangntha. He readily washed his throat with which, being given to the gods, enabled them to live over again. They resumed their effort andw ere helped by the Daityas, Danavas and Raksasas. Thus the Mount was brought over and placed to the Western side of Java. Due to the heavy pressure of the Mount, West Java went down and East Java heaved upwards. So the Mount had to be transferred to East Java Paramefvara being highly pleased allowed I�vara to ride on,.

drinking Taettvimypta-water, Siva, I6vara, Brahma and Visnu resorted to Yoga. � The third chapter opens with the story of Jagatpramana -and Uma, whose children, curiously enough, were Kamadeva and Smari. The penances of Guru and Parame�vari, their amours and the birth of Gaga and Kumara have next been - described with some details. Kamadeva, desirous of possessing . Smart, but fearing the wrath of Guru, divided the limbs of Smari into two parts, of which one became Rati, the beloved . spouse of Kamadeva. Subsequently, however, Rati was born as Turuk Manis and Kimadeva as Wengan, and both of ' them were united in wedlock. The author thus ingeniously avoids the patched-up fabrication of Kamadeva and Smari (Rati) as :the children of Guru. The penances of Guru and _Umg and the childhood of Gana and Kumara have been des�gribed with some detail. The penances of the two sons as ~ also the intellectual duel between Gaga and Vispu,and later, 'between Gana and Brahma, have also been related at some length." The five gods, who were created by Guru to support his son in the intellectual duel, sought instructions from him and he, unwilling to impart the science in pre�sence of Uini, sent her to bring mill from a black virgin cow, : Uma travelled all the world over, but did not find the requited cow, till she discovered one in the possession �of a certain cowherd.

The fourth chapter opens with ecclesiastical history, which is continued through subsequent chapters. Itis said that ParamefSvara founded the in Java. Guru is the first founder, and Sukayajfa is the first mandala. Many men are now desirous of entering the order of the Bhiksus, and 'they were initiated properly by Guru. The first to be initiated was Brhaspati, the second Soma, the third Budha, the fourth Sukra, the fifth Raditya (= Aditya), the sixth Sanaifcara, and the seventh one was Anggara (=Mangala)! This, as our author tells us, was the number of disciples of Guru at the time of the Sukayajfia. is the name �of the second mandala, After the description of some other mandalas, the- author introduces us to the story of the Brahmana Teken-Wuwung, who, by the grace of I�vara's initiation, became known as Mpu Siddhayoga. The latter wanted to marry, and his preceptor recommended to him Devi Kasingi, the eldest daughter of Wawuwlangit, king of Medang-gana. Though the princess was blind, the blessings of the mighty ISvara made her perfect of limb, and she now became known as Wiku Siddhayogt. The fourth chapter closes with the account of the arrival of I�vara, Brahma and V igau, who sought instructions from Guru.

~ The fifth chapter opens with the account of the Brihmana, Kacunda, who came to Java from the Mah@meru to be initiated,. There was also Agasti (=Agastya),'* who, through yoge, became known as Dharmaraja, and later �on as Rsi Siddhavamsitadeva. . The gods tried to kill him, but. failed till Guru killed him and placed his body on the top of the Mahameru.

They played Wayang and travelled throughout the earth with a musical concert, - After performing serious penances,.

These are, in short,. the main contents of the Taenxtu _ Panggelaran, which, asit appears, has sought tooffer _ explanation of various traditions - and institutions of Java, - The attempt to introduce Mahamera to Java represents the anxiety of the Javanese author: tosynthesise the Indian tradition to its Javanese environment.
The legend of Agasti is also a reflex of a similar tradition current in India, It should be noted, however, that though

1 Cf. also Sudamala, which we have discussed in a later chapter..

the Javanese author has introduced some Indian gods, i mandalas, mountains, etc., to Java, he has not presented all of them in the light of Sanskrit Paurapic works. This will be readily understood if we remember how the relations of various gods have been stated. It is probable, therefore, that the Taxtz Panggelaran is primarily based on various distorted traditions of India which floated in different centres of Indonesia, and partially also on native traditions. A mixture of these two elements has been responsible for its curious presentation. In many cases particular facts of episodes can be traced to Indian sources, but the whole episode, excepting some rare cases, does not tally with its counterpart even in bare outline. Thus, while the history of Mangukuhan is of pure native origin, the peculiar story of Durga is wholly foreign to Sanskrit literature. A great part of the work describes mandalas, Devagurus and various other religious orders. Men and women, it has been stated, receive initiation or #iZksz from Guru, who is described as the head of the mandala, Devaguru and some of his disciples were the founders of some mandalas,. The society within the fold of the mandala, as ' points out, has not sufficiently been described to allow us to form a correct opinion. But, it has been suggested, a comparison with the Aaframas, mathas, viharas, and other cloisters of Northern countries may throw some light on this point. Though it has shown great honour to celibate Bhiksus, marriages of them are also noted. The castes are nowhere mentioned in the Tanxniw Panggelaran.
Dr. Pigeaud thinks? that the reference to the Brahmanas occurs not as a castemember but in the sense of an ecclesiastic. - It betrays also some Tantric influences. Guru, the religious preceptor, who does not instruct before women, is a constant figure in Indian Tantric literature.

The Bhikgus of the Bhairava class, who practised &masizagamana and worshipped in cemeteries, doubtless belonged to the Tantric group.

The name of the author is not known. As he has not mentioned Bali, Dr. Pigeaud'! is disposed to accept him as native of Java, though, we think, this should be stated tentatively. As regards the date of its composition, we cannot state anything explicitly, The earliest MS. is dated in 1557 Saka. Internal evidences serve no useful purpose ; no light is thrown from Indian Pauranic literature, The author's knowledge of the extant kingdoms and evidence culled from the standpoint of society are not of much help. Dr. Kern thinks? that the language and style of the Texts have great similarity with the Old-Javanese prose-translation of the Adiparvan. If we brush off the crusts that have gathered round the language and carefully sift them, the original form, as Kern thinks, will make its appearance. According to Dr, Pigeaud,* it has also some linguistic affinities with the Kwhzarakarna, which Kern himself admits to have been extant in the last half of the fourteenth century a.D. The additional arguments, which Pigeaud has brought to bear upon the question, are : (1) that the queen of Cempa, who has been mentioned here, was entombed, according to a later tradition, in 1448 A.D.,* and (2) that she was already an incarnation of Devi Sri and thus a legendary character to the writer of the Tanxiz. Of these, the former being a doubt ful case, must remain open in the present state of our knowledge, The second one does not furnish a cogent

argument, because, even now, we call a virtuous woman an incarnation of Laksmi or Sri, while she is living. It will thus appear that the date of the Taxtux Parggelaran is still a matter of conjecture. We are inclined to believe that the main story has to be referred to a period not sufficiently removed from the date of the Old-Javanese Adiparva, say, between 978 and 1050 A.D.; some newer materials were engrafted upon the original kernel during the fourteenth century A.D. or a little later. It has to be observed that it is only in the last portions of the work that we come across later accretions.

Whatever be the date of its origin, nobody will deny perhaps, that in the Texts Paerggelaran we generally move in an Indianised society. The meaning of the title of the book is 'W orld-theatre',and it may have some justification for that title.

The second work, viz., the Manik Maya, is doubtless later than the Tanis Pangg�elamrzw It is written in the NewJavanese. The author has used the word "Allah," though, according to Winter, that is no proof of the later origin of the work. He thinks further that it was composed at Kartasura by Karta Mosada, probably after a Kaw:-/itrpsara. According to Prof, Veth, the work, as we have it, is to be dated in 1725 Aa.D.2 The main story of the book may briefly be described? in the following manner :Before the world and everything pertaining to it were"" created, there was Sang Hyang Visesa, who begged a boon of the Almighty. The latter was glad to suspend a ball over the head of Sang Hyang Visega, who divided it into three parts. The first part became the heavens, earth, etc., the second part became the Sun, the Moon, etc., and the third part was the man or Manik Maya.

yz Sang Hyang Visega gave charge of the entire earth to Manik Maya, conferring on him the title Sang Hyang Guru. The latter, being blessed by Sang Hyang Visega, begot 9 sons and 5 daughters, who, however, were not born in the mother's womb.+ One of these children was Mahadeva, and his wife was Mahadevi. He was asked to preside over the Eastern region, while the Southern region was placed under the care of Sang Hyang Sambu (=Sambhu), who married Sangyana,. - The third son, Sang Hyang Kamajaya, was married to Davi Rateh (=Rati), and they presided over the Western quarter.
The Northern region was placed in charge of Visqu, who was united with Sri in wedlock, Sang Hyang Bayu (=Vayu), the fifth son, got married with Devi Sumi, and ruled over the central portions of the earth, The Northeastern region was controlled by the sixth son, Sang Hyang Prebafijala (=Prabhafijana ?). The South-eastern and the South-western regions were lorded over respectively by Sang Hyang Kuvera and Sang Hyang Mahayakti.
Sang Hyang Sewa (=Siva) was the ruler of the Northwestern region,

Then Sang Hyang Guru went to the Nether world and placed 7 presiding deities over the 7 divisions. Returning from the Nether region, he discovered that the earth was inclined to the West. The deities said that it was due to the presence of a hill in the west, which he ordered to be replaced in the East to maintain the balance of the world.
The second chapter describes the creation of Sang Hyang Dharma Jaka, who begot a son named Catur Kanaka.
From the latter was born the celebrated Sang Hyang Kanakaputra, who went to do penances in the ocean.

The third section of the book opens with the description of the gods, who were despatched to uproot the hill and place it in the East, It is said that the gods were

spent up. with thirst and hunger and unknowingly drank 'off some poisoned water and died ultimately, Sang Hyang Guru also drank it, but finding it poisonous, vomited out what he had drunk. The effect of it, however,remained in his throat, which became Nila, ��., blue. So he became known as Nilakagtha,. The poison described as. C�l�zfte is evidently a corruption of the Sanskrit KilaZkuzte. He also discovered fine water called Kamandalu (!), which had the property of bringing the dead to life. Sang Hyang Guru drank it and gave some portion to the dead gods, who lived over again. It also describes how the perspiration coming out �of the body of the over-exhausted gods created many rivers in Kedu. Ths book further refers to god Ramadi, who was the father. of Brahma Kadali, and describss the story of the creation of 100,001 Vidyadharis, of whom Bhatiri Ratih was one. Sang Hyang Guru, however, married Bhatari Uma.

When all these were done, the Devatis and the Vidyadharis began to drink off the Terta Kamandalu. It was noticed by Rembu Culung, who here performs the function of Ratmaji and Ritmaja of the Taxtz. Candra drew the attention of Visnu and, before the Raksasa Rembu could drink anything, he discharged an arrow into his throat and the water could not get into his stomach,. So the head of the Raksasa was immortalised and it became the devourer of the Sun and the Moon,. Then follows a pre'posterous description of Sang Hyang Kala, whose eyes have been described to be as powerful as the Sun and the Moon.

Like the Tantu Panggelaran, the Manik Maya also does not furnish us sufficient data for the discovery of its original sources. Indian Pauranic literature cannot be regarded as the ground-plot of this work ; because a curious commingling in the names of Sang Hyang Guru's children, some of whom are identical in Indian literature, and much original accretions to the main plot, bar out that possibility.
Some names are doubtless of Javanese origin,. The: names of Kala Gami@rang, Rembu Culung, etc., may be cited by way of illustration. It is probable: that, like the Tents Panggelarar, it was also based on various mythological traditions, which, mixed up: with native accretions, assumed a curious shape, We discover, however, some traces of the Brakmindapzrina in the: opening section of the Maxik Maya, where the whole world has been described as originating from a ball or ende. The story of how Siva became Ntlakantha is graphically depicted in the Adiparva, Sanskrit as well as Javanese, and also in some other works. ' The transference of the Mahameru: from India to Java is contained in the Taxtu Panggelaran,.
which is an earlier work. This episode is not known toany Pauranic work of India, So the BraZkmindapzrina and the Adiparva may be regarded as the ultimate source of some portions of the Manik Maya, while the rest might have been derived from various traditions,

The story has been loosely knit together. It does not satisfy our curiosity about the girl of the casket, who had captivated Sang Hyang Guru,. We are also quite in the dark as regards the motive of the writer in introducing: another damsel towards the closing portion of the story.
Is she like UrvaS�i of Kialidasa's VikramorvaS, who had transformed herself into the charms of Nature and the magnificent landscapesr� Another thing that draws our attention is the laxity of moral ideas, which is on a par with, if not worse than, some of our Paurinic stories.

The story of the churning of the milk-sea, part of which has been borrowed in the Taxtzx Paerxggelaran and the Manik Maya from the Adiparvan, offers an interesting comparative study. Dr. Juynboll,* who noted this point long ago, observed that the height of Mount Mandara (peak: �of the Maha@meru), according to the Sanskrit Adiparvan, is II,00o0 Yojanas ; according to the 7Zeaxfx, one hundred: thousand Yojanas, (Then again, in the ?diparvan, Visnu appears in the r+8/Ze of a tortoise, and. Viasuki assumes the.
functions of a rope: In the Taxfs, however, Brahma occupies the place of Vignu (as a tortoise), who, in his turn, takes the place of Vasuki of the Adiparvan (as a rope). In the Manik Maya, these duties are performed by three deities, viz., Brahma, Vayu and Indra, Itis interesting to note that this episode has also been immortalised by the Klimer decorators at Angkor Vat in Cambodia, where the panel runs for about 50 yards. Here the. churn-staff is Mandara, round which is coiled the serpent Ananta to serve as a rope, and Visqu in the form of a tortoise supports the mountain.?" So, the tradition of the Khmer artists was quite different from those recorded in the Tantz Parggelaran and the Manik Maya. The Paurinic story of how Siva became Nilakaptha tallies in some respects with those recorded in the above-mentioned works,

As regards the episode about the origin of eclipse, we notice some slight discrepancies from the Sanskrit Adiparvan. < The Indian work states that the Sun. and the Moon brought information to Visnu about the theft of nectar by Rabu,. Angkor Vat gives a faithful version of the Indian story. In the Textw, however, the �ole of Rahu was played by Ratmaja and Ratmaji, names unknown to Old-Javanese

and Sanskrit Adiparvan, Some Kawi#-works also give an account of the same theme, but we shall discuss them later on. It was doubtless a very popular myth ; because, it has.
penetrated not only among the. Javanese peoples, but also among the Dayaks, Bataks, Alfurs of Halmahara, etc. The Rahu of Indian mythology is Rahu with the Malayese, Rabo with the Dayaks, and Akkalau (S%� Kalarahu) with the Bataks,.

The Tattva Sawang is also a cosmogonical work. It states how Sang Hyang Tayu created by his yoge 'two deities, viz., Brahma and Vigpu, from his right and left eyes,. Through yoga, again, he created Sang Hyang -Aji Ruci, who, as the story says, was responsible for the incarnation of Sang Aji Bhaya. The author then gives an account of the creation of wind, earth and fire. After that, by orders of Sang Hyang Tayu, created the first man, who became known'as Kaki Manuh ; Visnu created the first woman, who received the name of Nini Manuh. After the creation of man and woman, the Sun and the Moon were shaped. It has been stated that Nini Manuh begot five children, wig., Kaliwon, Wage, Pon, Pahi and Manis, As we have seen above, they are merely the five Balinese names for the five days of the week,

The Adipurina2, which we propose to describe now, combines in itself the characteristics of a work on Jurisprudence and on mythology or mythical chronology. It opens with two mutilated Slokas, which describe the aim of the Veda, and furnishes details of some deities. The main hero of the story is Vismanagara, king of Prastanagara. The author

describes that he was fully versed in the Astidab�adhkarma, which is divided into three categories, viz., Kaniste

It further presents some regulations regarding play, business, duty of the master to the servant, treatment of animals, regulation of debtor and creditor. It gives some details regarding trials, religious duties and the path to be followed by administrators, According to the story Vismanagara, discerning the transitoriness of life, followed.

which began to drift by itself towards Gawangan, where the great sage Murtthitasana lived. The great seer began to discourse upon cosmogony. He said that Bang Hyang Avarunting had a large number of eyes in different places of the body,'* from which originated Mayanisprha, earth, atmosphere, firmament, Bharuna (=Varuna?) _- gods - and others, Tribhuvananda (=Tribhuvananda) originated from his lips, while Bhatara Vifega came out of his fontanel, Avarunting, after the: loss of his eyes, created Bhagavan Sardda, who was responsible for the incarnation of Vindupwana, The latter, be-ing in possession of the book called KaZlimakosead, brought order into the world and created many gods, elements and various sciences. The author now describes the origin of the four castes. He says that the Brahmanas owe their origin to Bhagavan Suksmasadaka, Veg; as (= Vaifyas) to Tripurvana, and the Sudras (=3?dra) to Bhagavin Krpaduranga.
Bhagavan Turyyantapada has been described as the source of the EKgatriyas, Then follows a long genealogy of Turyyantapada, animals and other persons, Then follow

'some indecent passages corresponding to those leading to the birth of Kumira in the famous Kumiarasambhavam of Kalidasa, The author has then devoted some space for discussing the penances of Diirmittha, who begot �lzums, Tripurugas (= =Sudras', and human sons ; ; they were sent by their mother to bring the white deang Karacarana and a kind of peculiar stone. The adventures of these persons have been discussed at some length, At length, Diurmittha passed off to heaven,.

Vismanagara now enquires of Murtthitasana about the genealogy of the grand-children of Turyyantasuksma, who, it may be noted, owed their origin to Vindupwana.
The author states further that the PBrekmandaepurina, which must have assumed the position of a holy scripture .
by this time, was received by Bhagavin Suksmasadaka, a great ascetic, who was performing penances on the mountain Srngakasturi. The seer now traces the history of the Sudras (=S?dra5) and the Candalas (= Candalas) . to EKrpaduranga, but his disciple, the king - of Prastanagara, was constrained to remark that all these peoples belong to a common stcck. King Vismanagara now queried about the amprfa or nectar, and the sage related various incidents connected with its transference from the nether world to its deposit in Svetakamandalu at the bottom of the sea, The author states that this was received by Nirayana, who allowed the gods to drink the rejuvenating nectar. The Suradanavas and H�ndrararawu Singika also wanted to taste this amrta, but their demand was flatly refused. Though it was kept under strong guard, this 'Singika was able to steal it. Being informed of this by Surya, Visnu discharged his weapon at the neck of Singika ; the trunk fell down, but the head became immortal and the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, It

has to be noted that the story of the eclipse, in this book, though resembling the ground-plot of its counterparts in the Sanskrit and the Javanese Adxparvan,

from them in points of detail, After cursing the Danavas for their misdemeanour, Sang Hyang W�nang thought it fit to rebuke the gods for their inattention in guarding amrta. Murtthitasana now describes how Brahmi, Visnu, T�vara and other gods were deputed to protect the world and incarnate themselves in different kings. - It is curious, though not surprising, that Paficamahabhiita and Tanmatra (�=Tanmiatra) bave been personified. Nandi�vara (=Nandigvara) and Mahakala (=Mahiakala) were asked to guard the doors of the world. The author then gives a long.
genealogy of the Daityas, Yaksas, Bhatara Nirantara, further the genealogy of Vindupwana and many other kings.
At length Vismanagara enquired of the great sage about redemption, and Murtthitasana advised him to give up his royalty and kingdom so that he might get or the nectar of life. After many adventures, the king and the queen obtained emrfe, and therewith the salvation which they desired so much.

It should be noted that the work betrays some characteristics of Indian Paurapic literature. Expounding philosophical views or matters of spiritual interest by means of conversation between the preceptor and the disciple is a notable feature of many Pauranic works, and the present work unmistakably bears that stamp, A large number of names are doubtless of Sanskrit origin, though many of them appear to be strongly Javanised. Itis curious that the author has accepted some terms of Indian philosophy as if they were the names of persons. Then again, some: gods having several names have come out from the laboratory of the author as separate entities Though the names and activities of many peoples and gods of theAdipurina walt us into the familiar environment of Indian mythological literature, the frame work of the story seems to be the creation of a native. artist of Indonesia, Some traditions incorporated in the work were:

CH. VI] WARIGA AND CONNECTED LITERATURE hie

probably derived from current traditions of the times, while others, though Indian in origin, have got the exotic colouring of these islands. Itis thus a hybrid compound of Indo-Javanese elements. - We should not forget to mention, however, that Bhatira Guru, who is the highest God even in some late classical works of Java, has beet superseded here from his supreme position by deities with Javanised names,. - Dr. Pigeaud!' suggests, and probably he is right, that the work was a kind of Pra�ast or glorification of king Vismanagara, who might have been a forefather of the king to whose court the anonymous writer was attached.

It is not an easy task to ascertain the date of the present work, A Lombok MS. marks the date 1799 at the colophon. We tentatively accept this work as a literary product of the 16th century A. D.

It would thus appear that the undercurrent of spiritual life, as depicted in the Javanese mythological works, was not very different from what is in the Indian ones, Gods have appeared in both as the guardian angels and protectors of arts, crafts, vegetation and the world. Gods are either selfcreated beings, or they emanate from different parts of the body of some particularly powerful deities. Some have been described as not born of the mother's womb; some have gone so far as to create their own grand-fathers* ! Many religious orders of the country are founded by Indian gods, The books have again laid great stress on the s�kifnemahatmya and the namamakatmya, and have transferred the best-known Indian places to Java,.

We shall now discuss some semi-mythical works, which seem to contain some genuine traditions of olden times. The celebrated Javanese work 472 Saka may be grouped in this category. It was edited by Winter in the middle of the last century and part of it was translated by Raffles in his History of Java'*; We present here only relevant passages which seem to contain the tradition of Indian emigration to Java. It states:20000 families were sent to Java. by the prince of Kling*�, These peoples prospered and multiplied.
They continued, however, in an uncivilised state till 289, when the Almighty blessed thein with a prince named Kamo, who reigned for 100 years, at the end of which period he was succeeded by Basu Keti. The name of the kingdom was Virata. Basu Keti dying, he was succeeded by his son, Miangsa Pati. Father and son together reigned 300 years. Another principality, named Astina, sprang up at this time and was ruled by a prince called Pala Sara, who was succeeded by his son Abiasa, who was again succeeded by his son Pandu Dewa Nata ; the reigns of the last 3 princes together amounted to 100 years.
Then succeeded Jaya Baya himself, who removed the seat of government from Astina to Kediri,........" |

We have seen in the Balinese Bm/zmanolapurcma how the princes of Daha claimed descent from the holy Pulaha.
In this part of tne A/Z Sake, the author has similarly

sought to connect the royal dynasties with the heroes of the Bharata War, The legend which we have quoted . above is further continued in some othez Iegenda, parts of

which were abstracted by Kia Adipati Adi Manggala.
We may again take up the thread of the story which starts afresh with the reign of Jaya Baya. Our extract says,* "When Prabu Jaya Baya of Astina died, he was succeeded by his son and descendants, named Ami Jaya, Jaya Amisana, Pancha Dria and Kasuma Citra. During the reign of the last of these princes, either the seat of government had been removed, or the country had changed its name, for it was then called Kujrat or Gujarat ; and it having been foretold that it would decay and go to ruin altogether, the prince resolved to send his son to Java, and possessing the written account of 4;j�? Saka, which had been preserved in his family, he gave it to his son who embarked with about zoo followers for the island.................. They found that part of the island now known by the name of Matirem, when the high-priest, opening the book of 4;z Sake and referring to the prophecy that Java should become an inheritance to the descendants of Prabu Jaya Baya, summoned the whole party together and formally proclaimed the prince as sovereign of the country under the title of Browijiya Sawela Chala. The name of Mandang Kamulan was then given to the seat of government.
The prince then lost no time in improving his capital, which became an extensive city in the year 5253. From this period Java was known as a celebrated kingdom and extensive commerce was carried on with Gujarat and �other countries."

The most popular early history of Java is contained in the following interesting - account, which sets up a sort of mythical chronology? of the early kings of the island, In this list we come across the names -of some

_beroes of the Lunar dynasty, which prove the influence of : the great Indian epic upon the peoples of Java. The name of the heroine of the Ramiyanae-Devi Sinta-also occurs incidentally, - The story proceeds to - state that before the creation of any human being in Java, the presiding deity of the country was who was followed by Tritresta, son of Jala Prasi and grandson of Brahma.
He established his government at the foot of Gunung Semiru (Skt. Sumer) with its capital as Giling Wesi, His sons were Manu Manasa and Manu Madeba, Two exquisitely beautiful damsels, viz., Sinta and Landap, lived at his court and the description of their incomparable accomplishments allured Watu Gunung of Kling to declare war against him, and he was slain, Thus Watu Gunung, the adventurous hero of Kling, became the overlord of Giling Wesi, which he ruled for 140 years,. He was ultimately punished and killed by Visgqu in the year 240.
The vacant throne, however, was occupied by Gutaka of Kling, a protege of Batara Guru, and he ruled for so years, In 290, he was succeeded by his son Raden Sawela, who, after a reign of 20 years, was succeeded by Gutama. He removed the capital from Gilling Wesi to Astina, which was again given up for Lagrestina. Meanwhile, Raden Dasa Wiria, son of a Brahmana of Gunung Jali, established himself at the foot of the Lower Mountains.
in Java and his son Dasa Bahu captured Astina in 310.
He was succeeded by his son Suantana who began to rule the country wisely. In course of time a son was born to him ; but the mother died in child-birth and this necessitated the discovery of a woman who could suckle the new-born baby. It happened that on one occasion Ambu Sari, wife of Pula Sara, the grandson of Tritresta, was walking with her child Abiasa, when she . came across Suantana, who was seeking a wet-nurse for the new-born baby. But Ambu Sari would not suckle him: at all, unless the prince promised her the kingdom of

Astina, which she wanted to hand over to Abiasa when grown up. The prince entered into this bargain, and accordingly Abiasa came to the throne in 415. Deva Brata, son of Suantana, became the prince of Kumbina. Abiasa married in advanced years and begot 3 children, of whom the oldest was the blind Of the other two, Pandu Deva Nata was very handsome and the youngest, Rama Vidara, was lame. After a reign of 12 years, Abiasa� transferred the sceptre to his able second son Pandu, who married in course of time Devi Kunti. By her, he begot 3 sons, viz., Kunta Deva, Sena and Jin@ka and by his second wife, Madrin, he got Nakula and Sadeba.% As Pandu had died and his sons were minors, Drestarata was declared the protector, who, instead of returning the kingdom to the sons of Pandu, transferred it to his own son Suyudhana, who thus became the king of Astina.t The sons of Pandu were asked to settle in Amerta, wherefrom they sent their cousin Krsna to demand restitution of at least the half of the kingdom. - But the proposal found no favour with Suyudhana and hence a war, the celebrated Brata yudha,5 was declared against the sons of Drestarata, in which Suyudhana fell fighting. Puntudeva thus became king in 491, though two years later he gave up the royal sceptre to Parikisit, son of Abhimanyu, who was duly followed by his son Udayana, Then succeeded Jaya Derma and his son Jaya Misana to the throne of Astina.
As pestilence now - broke out, Jaya Misana's son, Jaya Purusa, removed the capital to Milawa, where his descendants reigned till Bisuracampaka departed for Mendang Kamulan, where he lived as a Pandit, The third king after him was Aji Jaya Baya, who became sovereign -of this country and named it Purwa Cirita, It is related of

Jaya Langkara, his son, succeeded him to the throne and before committing himself to the fire, divided the kingdom among his four sons. Subrata, his first son, was installed over Janggala ; the second son Para Yara got Kediri; Jita Wida, the third one ruled over Singasari, while the youngest one, Suwida, got Ngarawan.}

Before we try to find out the grains of fact from tons of fiction, we should like to preface our studies with some remarks of Dr. Hazeu, He says* that the attempt to trace epic heroes as forefathers of kings in many PBabeds or chronicles was not favoured in the Majapahit period ; this was an official attempt in the post-Majapahit period to lend an aristocratic colour to the ruling dynasties. The compilers, who were entrusted with the task of preparing genealogies and the lists of kings and kingdoms, lacked chronological ideas, and they have sometimes filled up gaps with fantastic things.s Gradually there came the reconstruction of old history, But the earlier part, as Dr. Hazeu says, * still contains fabulous matter and though we - can find here and there faint traces of historical facts, they do not tally except perhaps in mere names. It will be our endeavour to show that some of them preserve historical

facts and that they exactly agree with the information deduced from inscriptions.

1 Vide Raffles, History of Java, Vol. I1, 1830, pp. 78-82 and the chronological table on p. 86. The extracts of Raffles, of which we have given above a summary, are based on "the manuscripts of the Eastern parts of Java, Sumenap and Bali, as collected by Nata Kusima," who is "not only distinguished among the Javans for his eminent erudition,'' but would also "command a high degree of respect among the more civilized peoples of Europe."

Now, the first difficulty that would face us is to find out the initial year of the uzuspecif�ed /avanese era, to which the 'Hindu sovereigns' of Java have been referred in the above extract. It has bsen stated there that in yor was composed the which, we know, was written in 1157 A.D. Therefore, the initial year of the unspecified Javanese era falls in 1157-yorI=456 A.D. Now, if it can be proved , that the characters of the above list,! against whose name the unspecified Javanese era stands, can bear the scrutiny of inscriptions and other trustworthy evidence, we can take them, not as literary forgeries of later compilers, .
but as genuine historical figures. From the list of Raffles, we select the names of Ponto Dewa (No. 11), Udiana (No. 13), Kusuma Vicitra (No. 18) and Aji Jaya Baya (No. 22). Of the last-mentioned king, we shall not say anything, partly bscause the whole fabric of our studies rests on him, and partly because he is well-known from literature and inscriptions of the imid-twelfth century A.D.

Let us first take up Ponto Dewa, a name well-known in Java as Now the date which stands against his name is 491, which, when referred to 456 A.D., would correspond to 947 A.D. This is the last-known date of Sindok,? the celebrated king of Medang, who died without leaving any male issue behind. There is a dark period in Old-Javanese history after Sindok, and this is not much relieved till we come to the last decade of the foth century A.D., when we find DharmmavamSa, "king of East-Java" ruling. The earlier history of this dynasty has remained still now shrouded in darkness, Mr. W. Fruina/ al

mees! has conjectured 'that Dharmmavam@a might be the

son and successor of Makutavam�a, and further that heprobably fought against Wurawari in 977 A.D. But this remains doubtful. So, we have at least two persons of the

same name, -one name is furnished by inscriptions and the other by a corrupted list, Now, the problem is, what isthe mutual relation of all these (if they be

not identical), and their proper place in Old-Javanese history.

In order to trace the history of the Dharmmavaimfas from 947 A.D. onwards, it is necessary to interpret the relation that subsisted between Ponto Dewa (= mavaim�a) and the successors of king Sindok. The latter was succeeded by his daughter, Sri IGanatunggavijaya, who married Sri Lokapala, and the issue of their marriage was Sri Makutavam@�avarddhana, The accomplished daughter of the last-mentioned king was Mahendradatta, also known as Gunapriyadharmapatni, who was wedded to Udayana.
But, as Krom observes, none of them is mentioned as a sovereign.* Their issue was Airlangga, who married the daughter of Dharmmavam�a (Anantavikrama), and became king of Java. It appears that the period was troublesome,.
When the mighty king Sindok died," the country came to be governed by women. As a matter of fact, there was only one male ruler in the post-Sindok and pre-Dharmmavamf@a (Anantavikrama) period. ' It is possible that this offered an opportunity to Dharmmavainifa (Ponto Dewa) to carve out a small state from the dominion of Sindok, Itis significant that Udayan? was not king, though he was entitled to that honour through his wife. If Ponto Dewa be a predecessor

A

of Anantavikrama, the marriage of Udayana's son with the daughter of Dharmmavam@a Anantavikrama marks the union of two rival dynasties.

Let us now take. up Udiina from the list of Raffles.
U diana is doubtless Udayana, whom we know from inscrip-~ tions of Java and Bali. He was the consort of Princess Mahendradatt& and ruler of the island of Bali. Airlangga, their son, was born in 991 A.D.* The last-known inscription of Udayana in the island of Bali is dated 1022 A.D.
The unspecified Javanese year 575, standing against his name, when referred to 456 A.D., would yield 1031.
A. D. The small discrepancy which exists between the "two dates may be corrected if some inscription is found between A.D.

We shall now take up Kusuma Vicitra. The list ofRaffles does not furnish any date for his name, but the initial year of his successor is 638, which, when referred to 456 A D., yields 1094 A.D. Now, according to the Wawatehkan writer, composed his Old-Javanese Ramayana in 1094 A.D. According to the Balinese tradition," Kusuma Vicitra is identical with Mpu Raja Kusuma, also known as Yogifvara, who is now well-known to us as the author of the Old- Javanese Kakawin,. Kern*� doubted the veracity of the tradition on the ground that only the word is common to both, and there is' tio independent testimony to prove the identity of Kusuma Vicitra with Raja Kusuma. We think the Balinese tradition, the - Wawaeiekar - reference and [synchronism for the year 1094 A.D. raise the presumption to the

place of historical certainty, This incidentally settles the most vexed problem of the Rimiyana Kakawin ; but of this we shall have occasion to speak more fully later on.

Now the question is : what is signified by that unspecified Javanese era? Why does the beginning of this era fall in 456 A.D.? What particular event has been commemorated in that way ? We shall try to answer these.
questions.

In Java, there were current two eras, vig., the Saka era and the Safijaya era., We have tried to prove above that there was another unspecified era current in Java,.
whose first year falls in 456 A.D. We are inclined to believe that in this year the Sakas of the Gujarat region landed on the island of Java, because Candragupta II had.
already defeated the Sakas, and at least one Saka king was killed by him." It is not probable, however, that they were destroyed root and branch,. As a matter of fact,.
the joint-testimony from India and Java seems to show that they maintained their precarious existence in the neighbourhood of the Gujarat region. The certain dates of Kumiragupta I, the successor of Candragupta II, range between 415 and 455 A.D. About the year 455 A.D., the Gupta Vaem�e-Lakgmi "had been made to totter" by the Pugyamitras, the Hunas ( Bhitari inscr.) and the *Mlecchas' ( Junagadh inscr. ). If the emendation of Mr.
Divekar be not accepted, we may identify the 'Mlecchas" of the Junagadh inscription with the Sakas, who made a supreme effort to recover their lost position. But the Girnar inscription of 456 A.D., records in the third verse the final triumph of Skandagupta. So there must bave been many reasons for emigration from India to Java in 456 A.D. The traditions of these troublesome days are probably preserved in some folk-songs of Gujarat and South

1 Ind, Ant., 1923, pp. 181 �.

CH, VI] WARIGA AND CONNECTED LITERATURE 169;

Marwar.* - The other eras current in India were not known _ in Java, while the Saka era was an established fact. So, the.
year 456 A.D. marks the advent of the Sakas from Western India. There is no inscription of Java dated in the Saka year before 456 A.D. The outburst of Saivism somewhat.
later in Middle-Java also points to the same direction,.

There is only one small discrepancy which we ought to explain now. In ancient days, Gujarat was known as Lita, and according to Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar," the latter name persisted up to the middle of the ioth century A.D.
Dr. Majumdar thinks that the "establishment of the ruling dynasty of the Gurjaras at Broach cannot be pushed beyond the end of the 6th century a.p."%} In any case, the difficulty can be met by stating that the legend which we have been studying was compiled centuries afterwards, when the country was no longer known to the Javanese peoples as Lita, but had appeared as Gujarat. Indeed another MS. of Java, abstracted by Kiai Adipati Adi Manggala, says,* "During the reign of the last of these princes (Kusuma Citra) either the seat of government had been removed, or the country had changed its name, for it was then called Kujrat or Gujarat." If this prince be identical with Kusuma Vicitra, as he appears to be, then the above remark preserves a historical fact. For we know, the date of the last-mentioned king works out at 1094 A.D.

ITIHAISA OR EPIC WORX � THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

The Raimiyana of Valmiki and the Makabkaratea of Vyasa are two of the greatest compositions of all times.

"The - present - Sanskrit Rimaiyane embodies some pre-Buddhistic - materials, | Sravasti, _ Rajagrha - and Kaufambt, for example, are famous in the time of Buddha, but we hear of their foundation in the Ramayana Weber thinks? that the original Ramayana story is contained in the Buddhistic legend, called the which appears in some forms on the basreliefs of Bharhut and Safici-stupas (about the 2nd century A.D.), - By the time of its composition, the Rama-legend had assumed no definite shape ; because, in this version, we find no mention of the Southern Raksasas and Sita appears here as the daughter of i king Dafaratha,. Towards 'the close of the second century A.D., the Sanskrit Rimayana probably assumed its present form and the saga 'began to spread rapidly from the centre of India towards the circumference,. In 1903 Prof. Sylvain L�vit announced the existence of the history of Rama in the Chinese version of Ki-kia-ye, the first in the collection of 121 Avadanas.
It is dated in the year 472 A.D. In some respects, it

resembles the Dafaratha-/ataka ; because, it do�s not' describe the abduction of Sita by Ravana and the consequent expedition of Rama and Laksmana to Lanka. The story is merely confined to the exile of the two brothers and their subsequent return. In this version, Dafaratha is �called Cheu-Che, Rama is called Lo-mo, Laksgmana is Lo-man and so on,. A different version of the saga also occurs in.
a: Chinese collection of some Jataka-stories, which were 'translated by a monk of Sogdiana between 222-280 A. D.
"Though the names of our Rimaiyane heroes do not occur in this version, it appears to be more akin to the celebrated epic of Valmiki. Because, the episodes of Rama and Sita's exile, the abduction of Sita by Ravana, the fight of Jatayuand Ravana, the duel of Vali and Sugriva, the construction of a bridge to Lanka, the ordeal of Sita, etc,, have furnished the frame-work of this version. Quite recently, Dr. F.W.Thomas!* has given us an account of a ARinmi@yana story in Tibetan from Chinese Turkestan, and this has been dated between 700 and 900 A.D. � It combines some material from the: Balakainda to the Uttarakanda, but the incidents make a wide departure from the version of Valmiki. Indeed, Dr.
Thomas says, "The story, as told, is in form and substance wholly Indian, and the interspersed verses are unmistakably Indian in style and sentiment. But we should seek in vain for an Indian version of the Ramayana to which the text closely corresponds. It follows the general lines of the narrative in the Makabdharata (Vanaparvan, Chaps.
z70-290), but the incidents and the nomenclature differ widely, and indeed surprisingly."* � The subject was more popular in the far eastern colonies of Ancient India, The inscription of Veal Kantel� states

that the Rimiyance, the (Maki)bkhirate and the Purina were daily recited without interruption in a Cambodian: temple of the sixth century A.D., At Tra-kien in Campa, King (c. 653-679 A.D.) dedicated an image and temple to Valmiki, the writer of the Ramayana.
The bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat, Ba Puon and other structures preserve the main outline of the great saga of Ancient India,.� Reserving this topic for separate treatment later on, we now proceed with the account of the Old-Javanese Rimayanc, which, amongst Javanese recensions, stands nearest to the classic of Valmiki.

It appears from the bas-r�liefs of the great Saiva temple: at Pramb@na@n that the Rama-legend was well-known in Java in the oth century A.D. We cannot state definitely if the saga was known in the island before that date.
Chinese annals of the Liang dynasty (502-556 A.D.); Book 54, seem to suggest, however, that some kind of Rama legend was known in Java during this period. Our reasons for this assumption are that a part of Java was known as Langga or Lang-ga-su during this time, and Groenveldt says,8 that 'the description (of Lang-ga) suits Java very well," Indeed "Langka, Langkapura and: Ngalengka, though names of Ceylon, have been transplanted: to Java in the mythology of the country." In the year 415 AD., Prince Pa-ka-da-to of this country sent an.
embassy to the Chinese Emperor with a letter containing: the following lines, ij/ The precious Sexns�rit is generally known in his land. The walls and palaces of his:

Western Java, the occurrence of Sanskrit and the mention of Gandha-madana, when taken together, are significant. �

There is a large number of versions of the Rimayana in ' the lands of South-Eastern Asia We may mention the Ramakzien of Siam, which is no less popular than the Eikaiat Seri Rama of the Malay literature. The Serat Rama is also met with in various . translations of Java. Of these versions, we shall say something later on, Suffice it to mention here that about 1200 early-Javanese versions have been discovered, and they may demonstrate the great sway the saga had over the isles of Indonesia.* Of all these versions, the Kakawin of Yogifvara holds a unique position, and we propose, therefore, to give an account of this interesting Old-Javanese work.

The Sanskrit Ramayana has at least three recensions extant in India, vis., (1) the Bengal recension, (2) the KaSmiri recension and (3) what Jacobi calls recension "C." Now, this work of Valmiki, as we have it at present, is divided into seven Kindas, each of which has further been subdivided into various Saergaes, The Old-Javanese work of however, gives a narrative of the saga in 258 Sargas, containing 2771 strophes. Itis not divided into Kandas. The Sargas have - been faultlessly composed in various Indian C�ZemdeAhs.* According to R. ng.
Dr, Poerbatjaraka, interpolations occur in some strophes of the 6th, 123th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 23rd, 24th, 25th and the 26th cantos. As a matter of fact, they are many in the last three sargas.� Relying on verse 49 of the last Sarge, Dr. Juynboll conjectured that the writer of this Kawz-work was a Saiva. Indeed we find Ravana, coming to abduct

174 THE KAKAWIN

Sita in the guise of a Saiva monk not belonging to the fraternity of the Pa�gupatas who besmeared their bodies with ashes.

The date of the Old-Javanese Rimiyane is a most knotty problem in the history of Indo-Javanese literature, It will now be our endeavour to offer a solution of this problem, and bring order into the confusing mass of evidence, literary and traditional. Dr. Kern't has remarked that the writer of the Old-Javanese Kakawin did.
not know . Sanskrit. If that is so, we shall have to assume that Yogifvara derived the materials of his work either from some current traditions of the times or from a pre existing work, which must have been something like a free Old-Javanese paraphrase of the Sanskrit work of Valmiki, Of these two possibilities, we are inclined to subscribe to the latter alternative, because a work based on diverse traditions coming from India, Campa and Cambodia-Java being a meeting-place of exotic cultures-cannot enable one to follow, more or less: closely, the great epic of Valmiki. Besides, the second.
possibility has the additional advantage of explaining all known facts, It is necessary, therefore, to find out the approximate date of that Old-Javanese paraphrase, and the exact date, if possible, of the Old-Javanese Ramayana.

gig; Now, Dr. J. L. A. Brandes� says that the language of the oldest Kakawins is similar to that of the inscriptions of the time of the king Airlangga (950 �.R.). But the archaism, which the language of Yogisvara's work betrays, is no longer met with in the epoch of this king, though it has some affinity with the records of the time of. king Sindok. And

CH. VII ] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN 175

he concludes, therefore, that the Rimiyane Kakawin, at least the kernel of the story, as we have it, must be dated in the epoch of king Sindok. R. ng. Dr. Poerbatjaraka, while upholding the view of Dr. Brandes, says," "The words and spellings which the Rimiyane uses appear to agree with the Middle-Javanese records of c. 850 Saka or earlier, in any case not later than 900 Saka". And he has adduced some examples? in - illustration thereof.
Such are the following(a) the admission of Afect conforms to the older inscriptions. _

(0d) the use of the word exaekdi for 'woman' occurs in inscriptions of the time of Sindok,

(c) the frequent use of x for � in words, eg, panggu' and Lungguh (=panggih and linggih) is found in the records before the time of Airlangga.

(d) the nomenclature of village officers, e.g., rime marata and magemanr, is noticed in the older inscriptions,.

Kern� says that in spite of some obsolete grammatical peehliarities, the book is far younger than the Old-Javanese Adiparva, the Arjunaviviha and the Bharatayudd/ha, though far older than the Suzzasoma and the Bhomakavya. He con- _ jectures 13th century A.D. as the probable period in which the Old-Javanese Ramayana was composed. Scholars, who. have hitherto written on the subject, agree that it must be placed: between 950 and 1200 A.D. We shall now try to see if it is.
possible to be more accurate, We have probably succeeded in provingtn the preceding chapter that Rijakusuma,.
Kusumavicitra and Yogi�vara are ident'cal persons, Now: we shall adduce fresh evidence to prove that the Ramayana Kakawin was composed in 1094 A.D. According to.

Pindavavira, was a disciple of Yogi�vara's son, Mpu Salukat by name. We know of one Mpu Sedah, who was tutor to king Jayabhaya and author of the Old-Javanese Bharatayuddha (119y ADJ. These two Mpu Sedahs seem to be identical, because their names are identical and the subject of their work is also not different, and both of them flourished in the third generation after YogiSvara {1094 A.D. +25 +25). If we proceed by dead-reckoning from 1157 backwards, we shall certainly stop in the third generation somewhere near toq4 A.D. It may be that all the lists in the ning kakawin are not correct, but when taken together with other corroborative evidence, some of which we shall describe presently, the list given above seems to fix the date of the Old-Javanase Rimayaene in about 1094 A.D. We shall adduce other evidence.
According to a Balinese tradition,'* Dharmaja and Tana' kung, two poets of no small merit, have been described as the sons of Yogiivara, Vrifesaficaya and Luzbdkaka stand against the name of Tanakung, Now this Dharmaja has given a description of his patron KameSvara� in his popular Kaew#-work called the Smaredahana, which we shall study later on, - We know that there were two kings of this name in ancient Java, whose inscriptions are dated at 1129 and 1185 A.D.* The question is, under which of these two kings was the Smeradakanae written, Dr, Krom'� is disposed to regard the patron in question as . Kamefvara II, while R. ng. Dr. Poerbatjaraka� thinks

him to be no other than KameSvara I. Reserving elaborate discussions on the NM�nzaradakana for a later chapter, we shall merely indicate here the salient points in the argument of both these scholars ; because, a proper evaluation of their arguments may throw light on the date of the Old.
Javanese Ramiyana. Dr. Krom! says that Tanakung has used the words "Gzrindraevam�a;a'" (song 1) and "Girindrafanaya&a"' (song 37) in his Lxbdhaka, and, therefore, the latter work must have been composed at least when the first king of Singhasari was on the throne (1222 A.D.). He is perfectly right, but we do not think there is any adequate reason to identify the author of the with the author �of the Vritasaficaya. Excepting similarity of names, there is no independent evidence to identify these two persons.

'If this argument of Dr. Krom is not accepted, then the writer of the another Tanakung, becomes the

brother of Mpu Dharmaja. So they have to be placed in the reign of one Kamesvara who is sufficiently near the 'Old-Javanese Raimiyana (for is their father), And such a reign is that of KameS�vara I. It is noteworthy that R. ng, Dr. Poerbatjaraka has also come to the conclusion 'that Mpu Dharmaja composed his Snzaradakanza in the reign of Kamef�vara I on independent grounds. The historical data forming the background of songs 38-39 of this Kew: work have enabled him to arrive at such a conclusion. .We shall examine the point later on.
There are now some points which we ought to explain.
It has been stated before that the Old-favanese work betrays some archaisms. If those forms were not prevalent after c. 990 A.D.,2 how are we going to account for their existence 'in a work of 1094 A. D. We have said before that the work of Yogi�vara is based upon an Old-Javanese paraphrase

1 Tiidschrift VIAIT.L. VK., dl,. LVII, p. 518.
:2 We accept here a mean date between 950-1020 A.D. I 2

178 THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

of c. 990 A.D., drawn from an Indian REimiyane, probably written in Sanskrit,. A writer who closely follows another author cannot escape borrowing, sometimes unconsciously, from the latter,. And this is probably the reason why some archaisms have persisted in the work of Yogifvara, though it was composed about a century later. It may be asked, where is now the book utilised by the writer of the Old-Javanese Kakawin? We may best answer this question by presenting an analogy from the Indian Sanskrit literature.
As the classical work of Kautilya rang the death-inell of previous works on polity, so also the work of thrust the Old-Javanese - paraphrase into - oblivion.
There is again another point which we should not omit to discuss. In the Javanese preface to the Vritasaeficaya, it has been stated that the work was composed in the Kediri period under king Kusumavicitra, If our identification of Yogifvara with king Kusumavicitra be correct, then this is an additional proof of the veracity of the Balinese tradition. The real difficulties which the preface of the Vr�tasaficaya offers are that Kusumavicitra has been described as king of Kediri, which, we know, was then ruled by other persons,. If we accept him as a local ruler of some parts of the kingdom of Kediri! owing allegiance to the imperial power, then the difficulties are avercome, It is quite possible that such a petty state may pass under the sway of Pengging. Dr. Krom* has doubted the veracity of the preface on the ground that the power of Kediri never passed to Pengging, but to Singhasiri. And further, Kusumavicitra as a appeared suspicious 'to him. We!
do-not think that the historical data at our disposal are1 Many illustrations can be adduced from Indian inscriptions to prove that petty rulers have described themselves - as rulers of �'Susigara dharani,' i.e., sovereign of the sea-girt earth.

2 Tydschrift~VI,T.L. VE., dl. LVIIL, p. 519. ..

CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KRAKAWIN 179

sufficient to pronounce a 'final verdict on this point. Lastly, Dr. Kern has expressed the opinion that the Old-Javanese Kakawin is younger than the but older than the and has to be placed in the beginning of the 13th century A.D. As he has not adduced reasons for his remark, we have no opportunity to examine its correctness. $ 8

- We conclude, therefore, that the Old-Javanese Rimai- 2 yana was composed in 1og4 A.D., the work of Dharmaja about 1126 A.D., the Vrftasaficaya about this period and lastly, that the Lubdkaka was composed not earlier

than 1222 A.D. This chronology has the advantage that it does not run counter to any published data derived from

inscriptions, literature and tradition,.

Let us now turn from this puzzling problem to a more serene atmosphere. Let us now see how the Kew: Ramayana presents the whole theme :The first canto opens with king Dagaratha, who has been described as the father of Trivikrama or Visqu (2).2

The king is very virtuous and well-versed in the Vedas (3). Heis a patron of Saivism (7) and his prowess is like that of Indra (9). The king has his residence at Ayodhya (11), and his three wives, wis, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and Kaugaly@& are comparable to Durga, Ganga and Gauri (17). The author mentions the names of the Vedas in the Ioth strophe but we miss here the AZkaervaveda.
As king Dafaratha fervently wished for sons (21), he invited a certain RsyaSsrnga for the attainment of his object (22). In the following ceremony, the pretas, pisucas, etc., were propitiated (25). Siva (26) and the rgis or ascetics were especially honoured (30). In course of time, Kaugalya

2 These numerals will indicate the number of the Strophe. �

180 THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

begot Rama (32); Kaikeyi got Bharata, and Sumitra became the mother of Laksmana and Satrughna (33). Then the learned sage Vafigtha was appointed their teacher (35), and the boys soon mastered various sciences (36). About this time, Vifvamitra, the son of Gadhi, arrived at the court (38); he wanted the services of Rama for.
protecting the yazfies or sacrifices of the . ascetics (39).
Being requested by Da�aratha to relate the occasion of his gracious presence (41), Vi�vamitra described the difficulty of the holy sages (42-44). As king Paf�aratha was hesitating (51), he described the latent powers of Rama (58-59).
At last, the two brothers set out on their mission. Here the first Sezga ends.

(' The second canto opens most picturesquely. The poet finds ample scope to show his powers of description. This narration continues up to the Igth strophe, when the poet, like the writer of the Sanskrit PBZett��lvyam, says, "There was no water-place which was without lotuses, There were no lotuses which were not full of bees, and the bees were buzzing. There were no bees which would allow their songs go un-heard," and so on. y At last Rama and Lakgmana came to the cloister and all the sages came to them (29). They bestowed on them celestial weapons like Atidurjaya, Jaya. Vijaya and Jayanti (22).
When they saw the giantess Tadaka (23), Rama discharged arrows from his Gandiva bow, and she breathed her last (24).
The two brothers, Rama and Laksmana, are now worshipped as parts of Narayapa (30). The demon Marica then came to avenge, but he was shot (36) with the Vayu-weapon (43).
The two brothers were again worshipped (47). In the following strophe, the story of Vali, the churning of the Milksea and the episode of Ratu have been mentioned. The poet now leads us to the svnyamvam' of Sit3, the daughter of

1 Ibid., pp. 85 ff.

CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN 181 Janaka (49). Rama now breaks in two the bow of Siva, with which the latter had killed the demon Tripura in earlier times (56-57), King Dafaratha is now congratulated for being the father of such a son (62-63) While the marriage-party was returning to Ayodhya, it met Rama Bhargava on the way (68), After getting rid of him (71-77), the party again moves towards Ayodhya.

The third canto! opens with king Dafaratha, who was meditating on making Rama his successor (3). Queen KaikeyI wished that the honour should pass to Bharata (6). And so she proposed to Daf@iratha that Rama should be sent to the wilderness and that the crown should pass to Bharata (8-13). In this way, Rama, Lakgsmana and Maithili had to leave Ayodhya, and Sumati led them to wilderness (14). The news spread like wild fire, and Bharata, catching scent of it, hurried back quickly. He found all Ayodhya gloomy and almost deserted (25) King Dafaratha died soon afterwards (26). Bharata, who loved his brothers - passionately, scolded his mother for her machinations (30). He passed orders that the dead body of his father should now be burnt (32). Meanwhile, Rama was on Citralkata, where Bharata appeared (41). Laksmana took him to be an enemy, and put the bow in order (42).
He noticed, however, that Bharata was without arrows and other weapons (43). Bharata quickly came to Rama and broke the news of their father's death (44). Rama asked Bharata to return to Ayodhya, as he could not violate sacred promises (45-46). The conversation of Rama and Bharata closes the third canto.

The fourth serga� takes us to the hermitage of Atri (2) Thence the party proceeded towards the forest of Dandaka (3). On their way, the two princes and Sita met the ogre Viridha, who was ultimately killed (4-8). They

1 Albid., pp. 93 ff. 2 Ibid., pp. 108 ff.

182 THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

then wended their way towards the hermitage of Sarabhaniza (9'. The sage invoked Rama as an incarnation of Narayana (11). The poet then describes the hermitage of Sutikgoa (12).
In the 27th strophe, Siurpanakh�& makes her appearance. She saw that Laksmana was engaged in plucking flowers (29).
She took a fascination for him, and put on the guise of a lovely damsel (30). And she sought his love (34-35). He politely refused her love and sent her to Rama (36-48), who, on his part, sent her back to Lalksmana (51-53). The latter now suspected her to be a ralksasi(54), and cut off her nose (55) and she flew through the skies. From the 58th strophe onwards, the poet describes how she sought the help of Ravana, Khara and Dusgsana. Trigiraih became angry, and a huge arihy was despatched to avenge the wrong done to S&rpagakh?. The - fight now begins, and the next canto" opens amidst the vicissitudes of the war.

After the fall of Trigirih, Khara and Disana come to turn the scale of the war (1), but they are all killed (2), Sarpahakhz�i then informs Ravapa of the affair (3), and the latter sends her as a spy (5). She describes Sita's beauty (13) and says to Ravana, "Valueless are your eyes if they do not feast on Sita's beauty.........your ears are useless if they do not catch the melody of Sita's voice" (14). And this description of Sita's beauty continues through the following two strophes (15-16) - Ravana now consoles Sarpanalsha (17), and informs Marica of his sinister design

against Sita (223). Marica tries to dissuade Ravana (23-28).
As Ravana became angry (29), Marica consented to do the errand and transformed himself into a golden deer (39).
Then Sits took fancy for the deer and requested Rama to bring it for her (41). Rama pursued the unreal stag, but Laksgmana remained behind (42). Now, Sita beard as if

1 Ibid. pp. 110 f.

'CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN 183

Rama was supplicating for the help of Laksmana (45). So she wanted to send Laksmana, but the latter hesitated (49).
Sita scolded Laksmana by saying that he wanted to get her through the death of his older brother (57). Ultimately Laksmana went out (64), and Sita began to pluck flowers.
The following strophes describe the appearance of Ravana, and are worth reproduction :

"And while Sitt went into the beautiful forest and plucked flowers, Dafinana sought her out in the guise of a monk, He resembled a pure and upright Saiva monk, virtuous and holy ; his head was smoothly shaved, except for a little tuft of hair on the crown.

"His teeth were as white as crystal. He expected to get a garland of roses and a bowl of pumpkin to attach to his shoulder-belt. His monkish robe was beautifully red and was dyed with lac, He proceeded to ask for alms, by which pretext he could conceal his (base) design.

"While moving on, he mumbled prayers and had pious words on his lips. His glance was gentle and loving-it was outwardly very friendly and captivating, as if nothing remained of his demoniac character. - Without any interruption, he wended through the beautiful and solitary woodland.

"Thereupon he saw the daughter of Janaka in the forest.
She moved in the wilderness without the least apprehension.
Ravana went to her very much pleased. Soon he appeared before her and addressed her quite respectfully.

"How do you remain in this wood, O celestial one, and pluck flowers ! Thers is absolutely nothing in this world which can be matched with your incomparable beauty. Indeed, you are perfect ! Moon's beauty cannot be compared with yours, because her charms pass off by the time of day.

"If the lotus-flowers of the pond-of red and white hues and of rich scent-are plucked off in full-bloom, they can184 THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

not yet stand comparison with your beauty ; because, they close down and decline on the approach of night.}

"The place where you live is really dangerous, inaccessible for men, a wilderness! Do you not fear the malicious snakes and wild elephants �? How will your guardians know if you are attacked by tigers? Such a beauty as thine, O sister, compels men to spill blood recklessly,

"You are so exceedingly soft and tender and really so charming ; the wood has been, as it were, delighted by your presence. How fortunate is the man, who has been acknowledged by you as your husband | He must deserve some praises for possessing you at the present moment.

"I have travelled through other lands of this world,.
but I have never come across any one like you ; so beautiful. you are indeed ! You appear to me at least the most perfect type of beauty, and my present life is not going .
to be useless now that I have known you !" ~

The sixth canto? opens with the particulars of Ravana, and he now proposes to marry Sita (1-5). Being rejected by her, he fliss with her through the air (6) The poet: then describes the lamentations of Sita (7-14), Now the mighty bird Jatayu throws down the gauntlet and Ravana picks it up, and thus begins the duel (15-25). The bird is defeated (26) They make for Lanikai (27) and Ravana again seeks the hand of Sita (30). Meanwhile, Rama is anxious for Sita and his outburst of lamentation continues up to the 47th strophe, At length, the two brothers reach the place where Jatayu fought with Ravana

Vadanena sweadanayaste samavasthe ksanadaudhe."

2 Kern, op. cit.

CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN e 18� (50) When Rama dashes forward to kill the bird as if he was the devourer of Siti, Jatiyu breaks the news to Rama (65-67). Jatiyu describes himself as a friend of: Rama's father (68). The bird dies, and is burnt by the two brothers (74). The poet next describes how Rama killed

Dirghabahu, and how the latter assumed divine forms (76-78)...
Dirghabahu gives advice to Rama for his future course:

of action (83). The two brothers now see a Savara woman (98), who requests Rama to make an end of her curse (110).
They then repaired to the Pratitakalpa wood (114). The magnificent Pamp� lake met their eyes (115), and the poet finds an opportunity to offer a description of the surrounding landscape (115-124). Then they came to Rsyamuka (130). Hanumin now appears before Rama as a messenger: (132), and describes the errand of Sugriva (144). He says that for fear of Valin, his master remains concealed in the Mount of Malaya (146). He now seeks the help of Rama (147). Thus an alliance is cemented between Rama and Sugriva (150) As the latter describes the might of Valin (152), Rama pierces seven lonter-palm trees to show his strength (158). Now begins a duel between Valin and' Sugriva (162). But Rama could not distinguish one from the other (166) and Sugriva returns almost dead (167), Rama asks him to put on some distinguishing mark about his neck (170) _ Valin falls (172) and reproaches Rama for his dishonest trick (174-184). Rama justifies himself by saying that it is the practice of the Ksatriyas (186). Besides, Valin's conduct is not above reproach, as he robbed Tara, beloved of Sugriva (189). Valin becomes ashamed (190),.
and excuses himself by saying that it was settled by Providence that he would fight with his brother (194). Valin goes to heaven (197), and Sugriva begins to reign in Kiskindhya (203).

We now come to the seventh canto." Sugriva was now

'free from fear. Rama and Laksmana, therefore, retire to the forest again. Their goal was the Malyavan hill (1). Rama sees signs of Manmatha or Manobhava in everything and his whole heart pangs for his dear wife Sita. The rain-bow, for example, appears to him like the bow of Manobhava (5), 'fire flies as the flames of (12). The songs of CifeZkebirds awaken his saddest thoughts (16). He says, "With 'the antelops, I must compare your lovely glance...... with 'the Moon, I think of your beaming countenance. Ah!
how you have enamoured me!" (24) Again he says, "The surging waves of the deep sea have lent their un<dulations on your eye-brows as they quiver! And the glazing feathers of the dancing peacock are certainly, I should think, your - glazing hair-wreaths" (25). He arrives at Malyavin (31). Rama - becomes angry because, Sugriva has not yet kept his promise, and is still _dallying at the palace, forgetting the fate of Valin. He, therefore, sends Laksmana (34-38). The faithful Laksmana then proceeds towards Kiskindhya (39). Sugriva asks forgiveness and says that the proper time has now arrived for work (40-4232), He gives orders for marshalling the army of monkeys, and they now move towards Malyavan (43-44).
Sugriva begs forgiveness of Rama for the delay (45-46) and despatches Hanumin, Nila, Angada and Jambavan to.
search out Sita (48-51). With the ring of Rama (52) they jumped in the sky and came to the Vindhyas (53). There they meet an exquisite girl, whom they question about her particulars (653). She says that the beautiful house they saw was built by Vifvakarman (72), and that she is a Svayamprabha by name. Her father's name \ ais Merus@varoi (74). The poet then describes how she befools the apes (76-84). In the 85th strophe, the monkeys are introduced to the Sampiati bird, to whom they narrate their calamities and their ultimate aims, Sampati then gives 'them directions to Lanika, which he describes (gg-105).

min: prepared himself to go to Lanka, while others remained behind (113).

The eighth serge opens with a description of the Son of Wind, who "flies 2s quick as mind" (1). His body moves like a flying mountain (3) A raksasi named Dakini swallows him in a gulp, and Hanumi@n finds himself in her belly (5). - He splits open her belly and moves on (6), while the dead body of the raksasi fell in the sea and provided a feast to aquatic animals (7). The hill Menaka in the 'middle of the sea now comes to his ken (8). As it was the friend of the Wind-god, it invited Hanumian to take rest (9). Hanuman stops and does full justice to his belly with fruits (10-14). He now informs the hill of Rama's errand and his desire to kill raksasas (15-17). He next mets the raksast called Vikataksini (18) and passing into her body, he assumes enormous shape and the giant: ess breathes her last (20). He also observes a large number of raksasas, soldiers, etc., and for fear of being seen, he moves stealthily (26). All of them - were speaking of Ravana in high terms (27). Charms like swlep, ve;rakaya, .tidem are described to be in vogue. Besides, yoga and fastras are noted as being extant in Lanka (29-31), The poet then offers a description of the drinking bouts of raksasas (32-34). Hanumin now descends on Lanka and observes many nymphs, demon-girls, the Puspaka car, etc. (60). He searches for Sita and proceeds towards the Asoka-garden, situated in the East of Lanka (86). Indeed Sita was there (91). Ravana also comes to court the favour of Sita (112-114), who scolds him for stealing her like a thief (128). She then describes Rama as Purugottama and a divine mortal (131-137). Ravana, disappointed, returns to the city (138). The post then describes the lively conversation of Sita and Frijata, the latter being

188 - THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN

the virtuous daughter of Vibhisana (140). Hanumin was exceedingly delighted to perceive the innocence of Sita (178).
As the latter suspects him to be Ravana in disguise, he relates her former history and his own parentage (179). As Sita still had her lingering doubts, Hanuman describes Rama in the Malyavan hill, the Rsyamuka, the mighty Sugriva,.
etc., (189-192). After relating his experiences of Lanka (193-194), Hanumin holds the ring of Rama to Sita (196).
Sita, quite satisfied, now gives him her crest-jewel (204).
After his errand is finished, the monkey-hero decides to spoil the beauty of the ASoka-garden (213). Indeed: scattered pela�a-flowers dropped like rains of fire (215).

The ninth serga* continues the theme of the preced ing canto. As the depredations of Hanuman continue, the watchers run off to Ravana (1-2), and report the whole affair (3-8), asks the rakgasa army to kill the Son of Wind (9), who, meanwhile, takes his position on the gate behind the raksgasa-hosts (13). _ While the demonsoldiers shoot arrows aimlessly (14-15), Hanumin makes a club of a high and thick sandal-tree with which he begins: to work havoc on the enemies (16-20). Many are killed and the report of the ineident is sent to Ravana (21-32), who passes orders for a - more powerful draft (33). With a long Z@/-tree, Hanuman repeats his: former feats (39). He again spoils the coral-trees (42), and" brings about the death of Akga, son of Ravana (45-51).
After bathing in the sea, Hanumi@n again turns his attention to the pleasure-gardens which he destroys (52-57). He then takes some rest outside the garden, and Indrajit, known as Meghanida, comes to test his valour (58-63). The scenes of their fight are then described (64-73 Bound down by z@gapass, i.e., the serpent-weapon, Hanuman is.

kill him (91), but Vibhisana intervenes,

�CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN 189

The next sarga* opens with the protests of Ravana, who recounts the mischiefs done by Hanum�@n-(1-9). The latter argues with Ravana, and after describing the alliance of Rama and Sugriva, he foretells the victory of Rama (10-25). Ravana bursts into fury (26), particularly for the death of Yojanabahu, Tataka, Marica, etc., (30-41). Hanuman says that he has been sent as a messenger of Rama to find out Sits, and he then answers the accusations put forward by Ravana (45-67). Being angry (69), Da�amukha orders his followers to set fire to the tail of Hanumin (yo). And this is faithfully carried out {7 1-72).

The theme is spun into the opening scene of the eleventh ~canto.* Hanumin becomes as large as the Mount Meru, the

chain of zigapi�e tears off and he springs into the sky like kalignt. - Tongues of fire shoot forth in every direction, and there is a huge commotion (1). Indeed, houses look like the golden temple of god Ifvara (2), Thus Lanka is burnt to ashes (34). After taking leave of Sita from the Asoka-{orest, Hanumin again springs into the sky {5-6), and the sea-waters surge up on account of the wind created by his meteoric progress (7). At last he meets _Jambavin, Angada, Nila and all other apes (9), to whom he reports the success of his mission (13). Hanuman interviews Rama and Laksmapa on the Malyavain hill (16), and delivers to the former the crest-jewel of Sitt and a letter (22-323). All now move on towards the south and reach the Mahendra Mountain (50), wherefrom they saw Ravana's Lanka, Raima again feels his separation and Laksmana consoles him.

The twelfth serga� opens with the description of

morning _ in-- Lanka, Strophes - (4-30, 37-44) offer" erotic description of young men and women. The poet then speaks of favour-hunters who danced attendance on Ravana, who is now in his audiencehall.

The following canto" describes the arrival of pafiks and other dignitaries of State, _ Vibhigana, after offering prayers to Sankara, meets his mother (4). She foretells the doom of the kingdom on account of the viciousness of Ravana (6-13), Then he enters the audiencehall (15). Dafinana holds a council of war in which he relates the progress of Rama and the death of raksasas (20-26), After the speech of Prahasta (30-38), Vibhisana observes that none can prevail against Rima and that Ravaga ought to be reconciled to him (40-98), DaS@nana is angry.

The fourteenth serga* opens with the speech of; Sumali, the grand-father of Ravana on the mother's side. He repeats the wise words of Vibhisana and - proves the divinity of the mortal - Rama.
He incidentally describes how - Vrtra, enemy - of Indra, was killed by foams of water? (1-7), and how Hiranyakagipu met his death in an unnatural way (8-13).
Sumili, therefore, advised Rivana to be reconciled to Rama, because the latter was no mean foe (14-19). Kumbhakarna awakes now, and describing the words of his grandfather as a useless sermon, he asks Ravana to be steadfast to his purpose (20-32). He again falls asleep and Vibhigana begins to advise Ravana, though without any avail (35-47).

Various omens appear in the sky (39), and pificas begin to dance (40). As Vibhisarna repeats his advice (43-45), Da�amukha bursts into fury (48). Ravana calls him treacherous and scolds him (49-67). Vibhisana now takes leave of Ravana (70).

In the beginning of the next canto* we find Vibhisgana soaring high in the air for the Mahendra Mountain (1).
The monkeys took him for (2), and the som of the Wind-god hurried off to meet him but they recognised each other (3). Hanumin introduces him to Rama (6-7), The poet now eulogises the virtues of Vibhisana and Rama (8-12). As crossing the sea becomes a puzzle to Rama (13-15), he becomes angry on the sea and takes his mighty bow (16). The whole world - shudders (17-18).

All these are deposited before Rama (62-69).

The sixteenth canto' opens with Nala, the son of Vi�vakarman and architect of the monkeys (1). The superstructure of the bridge was built upon the huge hillock, which was thrown down with a tremendous splash (2). The dam became broad and plain (3-4). When Da�amukha comes to know all, he is apprehensive (5), Rama and Laksmana become joyful, while Sugriva and other monkeys

praise Nala for his successful work (6). The march begins and

the army views the exquisite Suvela Mountain on the Northside of Lanka; itis as grand as the pleasure-court of Indra {7-8), Gandharvas and Kinnaras are enjoying themselves there (10). The beauty of the mountain and that of the sea are then described (11-13). The sights and sounds of the Suvela mountain are graphically narrated by the poet (14-40), The monkeys arriving at the mountain enjoy themselves to their heart's content (41-47).

The poet now introduces us to the seventeenth canto."

It describes in the beginning how the heart of Da�anana was longing for Sita (1-23). He, therefore, builds two replicas of the heads of Rima and Laksmana (4). Now, addressing Sita that her relations are no longer alive, he renews his former proposal (7-20). Sita laments her misfortunes (26-35), and says that she would follow them even in the hell _Aveci (36), She bends over the head of Rama and laments again (37-45). The poet mentions in the 45th strophe that Rima followed the Hasavigamae. Sita again laments over Laksmana (46) Dagavadana is disappointed in his aim (56-59). Sita now says to Trijata that she will commit herself to the flames (61-67). But Trijata sees favourable signs, because her left eye dances (75). She therefore ~wants to meet her father on the Suvela mountain (76), and

sequests Sita not to die till she returns (77). She meets

her father, Rima and Laksmaga (78), and reports to her father all affairs of Sita and Ravana (79-80). Her father asks that the true report should be placed before Sita (81-823). Trijata returns and consoles her (83-90) The firegod is invoked (q2-99). Sita's pangs of separation are then described (ios-110). In the 137th strophe the poet describes that the Ramayana and the Makuib/karata were originally songs of men.

The eighteenth canto! is like the Udyogaparvan of the Sanskrit Makibhirata. It foreshadows the coming war.
Ravana sends the spy Sukasirana to measure the relative strength of the enemy in the disguise of an ape (2).
He was detected and arrested (6). Rama questioning the necessity (7), Vibhisana describes that he is a disguised raksasa (8), At last he is set at liberty and he escapes to Laika (11). Sukasirana reports that the Suvela mountain has bsen packed to its fullest capacity by the monkeyhordes (13), and he describes the prominent heroes of the enemies' camp (16-18). As he now advises Ravana to be reconciled to Rama (23), the rAksasa-king bursts into fury (27). Prince Angada now goes to Lankapura (35), and holds an audience with (38). The former threatening utter consequences, if Sita is not returned (40), Dafinana becomes angry and refuses him point-blank (44).
Angada reports the result to Rama.

The nineteenth serga* describes the war-scene of the two contending hosts, It need not detain us long, and 'we pass over to the next canto. The poet describes how the blood of warriors and beasts formed the Vaitarinn (1-2).
'The pifacas and other evil spirits dance in joy (3). The poet describes the fight of Indrajit, Angada, V ajramusti, Anikumbha and others, The war-scenes continue in tedious details, Indrajit at last bounds down Rama and

Laksmana in zigaepise (55-61), The monkeys cry over their prostrate figures (64-66). Indrajit reports the incident (74), and there is much rejoice in the rakgasa camp.

The next few cantos! also follow, more or less, the account of Valmiki. After the end of the battle, in which Rama and his lieutenants came off victorious, is described the fire-ordeal of Siti. Dr. Juynboll says that Sita is ultimately reconciled to Rama in the work of Yogifvara, which marks a noticeable departure from the present work of Valmiki, which ends the legend with Sita's disappearance in patala or the Nether-world.

It will thus appear that the Sanskrit legend does not much suffer in the hands of the Old-Javanese poet, We do not, however, come across the long-drawn episodes of the Balakanda nor do we find the history of earlier times as told by Vafistha to young Rama. Indeed, as the work of YogisSvara is less bulky than that of Valmiki, the former has not been able to accomodate some more episodes which might have been present in the Old-Javanese paraphrase

-of the Sanskrit original. Though the poet has left out many things from the scope of his work, he has also introduced some new matters,. The current of politics and religion has left some indelible impress on the Old-Javanese kakawin, The meshes of court-life and social ethics have left some trace behind, We can, however, excuse the author on the score that his work was composed centuries after the time of Valmiki. In style and sentiment, however, the work is truly Indian. The description is powerful and sometimes the comparisons are superb. Some portions of the work are full of puns and the author has devoted more space for mere description than is due to a work of 2771 strophes. But taken as a who'le, it is a permanent contribution to Indo-Javanese literature,

1 The remaining cantos have not vet been published in the Bijdragen T. L., VK.

CH. VII] THE RAMAYANA KAKAWIN 195

We cannot, however, close our review without a few words on two other works, uwis., the Uzferakinda and the Serat Rama, with which the Old-Javanese kakawin forms a group. In the Sanskrit Ramiyana, as we have it, the Uitarakanda stands as an integral part ; in Java, it is an independent work-a free Old-Javanese paraphrase of the last book of the Indian Ramiyana, Dr. Van der Tuuk says that the book is a prose-work interspersed with some Slokas, But they have been so corrupted that they can not be profitably studied without the help of the original.
These Slokas generally agree with those of the Telugu recension, though there are differences from the readings accepted in the edition of - There is also a Balinese recension of this work ; but it is shorter than

the Old-Javanese translation and records some - original matters, The book has supplied materials to the Harifreya

and the Arzznavizaya and, therefore, this will come to our ken again. The closing portion of this work, viz., Rinaprasthinikam and the Svargarokanani, reminds us of the last portions of the Makabh@rata, Cod. go31 ends with It Ramayana Utiarakinda prakrtam parisamapta. �

The Serat Rama written by Yasa di pura in the tembang macapat metre may be characterized as a NewJavanese adaptation of the Old-Javanese kakawin, Although it has almost literal agreement with the Rawi-work of Yogifvara, it has its deflections, though they are not much

pronounced,

ITIHASA OR EPIC WORKS, Contd.

(B) The Later Ramayanas

L

In this chapter we shall discuss some other Ramayana recensions, which form a group by themselves. From this standpoint, the Ramayana Sasaka,* the Rama Kling," the Serat Kanda," the Malay Hikaiat Seri Rama,* the Rama Kidung Bali* and Rama Tambak� are as much near to one another as the works in group (A), described in the preceding chapter. In a general work of this character, it is not possible to do full justice to all these recensions and, therefore, while we shall select the most important ones for our study, we shall occasionally relieve our observations by comparing them with the less important versions. The Malay Hikaiat Seri Rama has the advantage of text-editions in Dutch and English, while an elaborate summary of the Serat Kanda has appeared in Stutterheim's Rama-legenden und Rama-reliefs in Indonesien. In the following lines we shall make the version given by Dr. Stutterheim the basis of our study.

The work begins with the account of Nabi Adam of Mekah (Mecca) and his sons, viz., Abil and Kabil. The

Satan Idajil, whose account is also given, calls himself Manik

Maya. The writer has also furnished us with some details of the direct descendants of Nabi Adam.

The Serat Kanda ning ringgit purva� also betrays Islamic influences and it opens with the quarrel of Adam and Eva.
Jn the version furnished by Stutterheim, we notice a strangei grouping of Islamic and Hinduistic figures, e.g., Nabi Nuh (Noah), Devi Uma (Uma), Sang Hyang Bayu (Vayu). - The writer then offers the description of a great flood from which the devil Idajil escaped by creeping into the ark of Nuh.
Then follows the birth of Bisnu and (Visnu) Basuki (Vasuki).

Islamic figures are in the back-ground of these stories.

The history of Rama and Ravana� begins in song 22.
The birth of Rama, however, is treated in the 46th canto.
All the intermediate songs are devoted to the previous history: of both these kings and their families. So the history of Ravana, which is treated only in the last Kanda of Valmiki, is shifted here to its logical place". The story proceeds to state that the demon-king Kuvaca Indra got Giling Vesi from Brama. He had three sons, viz., Niti Kuvaca, Daica Sumangli (Sumali) and Jambu Mangli. He had also a daughter called Citravati. The kingdom of Gilling Vesi was now re-named Indrapuri. Niti Kuvaca was made king of Bruvaspurva.

The gods apprehended that Kuvaca Indra had hatched a plan of invading heaven. Out of fear for the mighty demon, they formed a group with Sritrusta (son of Srigati), Adiserat (son of Citragada) and Bramaraja (the great grand-son of Nerada). Of these, Adiserat was promised the kingdom of Bruvaskanda, and Bramaraja that of Indrapuri. Sritusta promised his help on condition that his progeny should be

2 Spelt as Rahwana.

3 The insertion of Ravana's history in the last book of Valmiki has to be accounted for by the fact that Ravana had no place in the earliest specimens of Rama-Saga. - When the story took more definite form, his history had to be placed somewhere. So it has been placed in that portion which did not form the kernel of the story.

198 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

the first kings of Java. After Kuvaca Indra had been killed and his body had vanished, Bramaraja became king of Indrapuri and married Citravati, daughter of the demon-king.
She bore him a son named Citrabaha. By his second wife Sastravati, he got several children, viz., Sakisar, Ngamadita and Srimandala.

As promised before, Adiserat became king of Bruvaskanda.

Then occurred the illicit love-affair of Bisnu and Prativi (Prthivi), which came to light through the dragon Naga Pratala.

Now, Adiserat Anjakravati, to give him his full name, appointed the ape Sapardan and the demon Batlavijan as governors. It happened that about this time Kalamuka and Tritrusta aspired after the hand of Citravulan, the sister of Adiserat. They received a chest from Adiserat, who told them that his sister would be found therein. They then returned home; but when the chest was opened, a dense fog arose therefrom. A chain also came out and bound them both. Thus secured, the two kings were led before king Adiserat. - Kalamuka threw himself upon the mercy of the mighty king declaring that he did not wish to marry the king's sister, who might be given to Tritrusta.

Adiserat got two sons, viz., Dimahraja and Ruvatmaija.
His younger brother Muntadari was king of Dravatipura ; he also bore the name of Gutaka. Two sons were born to him, viz., Sri Gutama and Resi Kala. Now Citrabaha, whom we have described previously, wanted to marry Ni Indratna, the daughter of Niti Kuvaca. After overthrowing the demons and installing Sakisar as the provisional Governor, Citrabaha returned to his palace. The intended marriage was now completed ; it was also decided that the kingdom should pass over to Balikas should he return. This was followed by the marriage of the king with Sukesi, the daughter of Sumangli of Purvakanda. By his first wife, Ni Indratni, Citrabaha got a son, Dasamuka by name ; the second wife .
bore him twins, viz., Ambakarna (Kumbhakarna) and 'Sarpakanaka (Surpanakha). Later on Vibisana was born.

�CH. VIII] THE LATER RAMAYANAS 199

According to the Hikaiat Seri Rama, their sister was Sura .
Pandaki*, which is evidently a corruption of the Sanskrit name.

On account of his insolent behaviour, Dasamuka was exiled by his father, and he set foot on the island of Ngalengka. This is also related in the Malay recension of the story. Coming to this island, he found Purvaningjalma (Nabi Adam),* who promised him sovereignty of the four worlds, 'spirits and demons, and so forth, if he were virtuous and committed no harm to ascetics. Then he received the name of Rahvana Aji, and after building a most beautiful residence, he appointed Vagrasinga as the patih. Meanwhile Bisavarna, brother of Rahvana, had seized the throne of 'Citrabaha. - Rahvana now hit upon the idea of teaching his father a good lesson. He, therefore, appeared before Indrapuri ; Bisavarna escaping to heaven, Rahvana seized his palace. After placing Vilmanaramja, son of Bisavarna, 'on the throne, he made Sakisar Regent of the Capital.

Meanwhile from another side a revenge was planned.
When Balikas returned to Bruvaspurva, he heard the activities of Citrabaha and thought of a reprisal. But Sakisar wanted to avert the catastrophe. All came to Ngalengka and, as was natural, the new friendship was cemented by marriage. Thus, Vagrasinga married Sarpakanaka, Ambakarna espoused a daughter of Balikas, Vibisana married Srimalahina, and Caturjan, son of Citrabaha, married a daughter of Sakisar.

After storming heaven, from which the gods narrowly escaped, Rahvana thought of chastising Adiserat ; because, he thought that the latter had insulted his messengers.
Two envoys were sent to Adiserat with demand of submission. The threatened king prophesied that Rahvana would be victimised to the monkey-heroes. Sang Pardana, the

white ape, would certainly incarnate in one Bergava and bring about his downfall*.

King Adiserat then went to perform asceticism. Rahvana now wanted to lift the wife of Adiserat in the disguise of her husband. But Batlavijan and Pardana, two generals of the king, pressed him hard, though they were killed. Pardana promised revenge in his incarnation of Hanuman. Meanwhile, the object of all his struggles had fled to her lawful.
husband. Rahvana also went there but was defeated by Adiserat. ,

In course of time, Dimahraja, the son of Adiserat Anjakravati, became king of Bruvaskanda under the name of Adiserat Maharaja." The younger son, Ruvatmaja, began toclear away the jungles of Mandrapura� for the purpose of founding a city." In the Malay Serat Kanda, there are likewise two brothers. Indeed, the Hikaiat Seri Rama presents king Dafgarata in connexion with an identical occasion, viz., that of clearing away jungles for the foundation of a .new city. We find in both the Javanese and the Malay versions that only a bamboo-bush was left out. As.
the Malay story tells us, it grew up as soon as it was cut off.
So the king personally went there, and, after destroying the bush he discovered a most exquisite woman. The Javanese Serat Kanda tells us that the king used to enjoy the coolness of the night in the neighbourhood of that grove. One: night he saw a luminous figure slipping into the bamboos..
He laid there a snare and succeeded in catching the nymph, who was no other than Balyadaru, the grand-daughter of Hyang Visnumurti. In the Hikaiat Seri Rama, her name appears as Mandudari and Baliadari is the name of a different wife. Now, as the Javanese recension tells us, this Balya1 Rama-legenden und Rama-reliefs in Indonesien, p. 254.
Dr. Stutterheim says here that Bergava is not the incarnation of

monkey and the mistake might be due to the fault of writing. - Sang.
Pardana would rather incarnate in Hanuman.

daru was married by Adiserat Maharaja. On another occasion, he heard some one again crying in the bomboobush, and was informed by Balyadaru that she was another Vidadari, Retna Aju Bandondari by name, the daughter of Hyang Rura and the grand-daughter of Basuki. She was.
also taken over to his palace. Ultimately he married her.
Visnupati, who came to bless the marriage of his daughter Balyadaru, bestowed on him the name of Dafgarata of Mandrapuri.

The writer then introduces us to Rahvana, who is.
presented as a veritable Don Juan. Now he thought of the necessity of getting the boon of long life. Aud so he went to Hyang Guru, who sent him back to Visnu. The gods did not like the idea and forged weapons for the coming war. Visnu not only promised his help but also thought of incarnating himself among human beings. Meanwhile, Rahvana came with his prayers to Visnu ; his eyes fell on the lovely features of Sri Mendang, the wife of Visnu.
As Visnu objected to his having her, he was attacked by Rahvana and defeated. Now both Visnu _ and Sri Mendang fled and incarnated themselves elsewhere.
Rahvana, however, pursued Sri. On the way, he met a Vidadari, the daughter of Hyang Indra, and she kindled his lust. Indra was compelled to bestow the girl on him for fear of the invasion of heaven. After some time, he abandoned her and returned to Ngalengka. He then gave orders to Marica and Gumuka to bring in Sri Mendang from Ngawu Langit, where she had incarnated herself. Arriving there, the messengers found that king Lesmantaka had only a little daughter and they wanted to wait till she was grown up. Lesmantaka sent one of them with a letter to Ngalengka.

The writer of the Serat Kanda then shifts the scene to Dravatipura, where Hyang Gutaka was reigning. He wanted to nominate Gutama as his successor, but Gutama had no allurements for royal power, and took to asceticism.
Thereupon Gutaka nominated Resi kala as his successor an condition that the latter would relinquish the kingdom if

202 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

Gutama returned, As a matter of fact, Gutama once went to the residence of one Gajendra and, after killing him, obtained his daughter" for his wife. Then they returned and took the sceptre from the hands of Resi Kala, who, deprived of his kingdom, carved out a new one and called it Mantiladirja.,

We have seen before that Visnu had incarnated himself.

Indeed, he was no other than Partavijaya, the king of Rancang kencana. His son Arjunavijaya dreamtof a certain Devi Secavati, princess of Ngawu Langit, and he wanted to find her out. In a certain residence, he took to asceticism and was disturbed there by ten kings, who used the palace as a rest-house. This was followed by a battle in which Arjunavijaya became a ten-armed man. The kings were defeated. According to the Serat kanda ning Ringgit Purva," the daughters of the defeated kings were married by him. In any case, the version recorded by Stutterheim describes that he named the residence Maospati,* and again proceeded in search of the princess of Ngawu Langit, the daughter of Lesmantaka. As we have seen before, Lesmantaka had already sent a letter to Rahvana, who burst into fury after perusing the letter. He marshalled a huge army under the leadership of Marica.

Meanwhile, Devi Secavati had also dreamt of a beautiful prince, Dasabahu of Maospati. Now this person, who was no other than Arjunavijaya, arrived to court the hand of Secavati. She consented on condition that the prince should find her out from the group of a hundred statues. The prince came out successful from the crucial test, A Sayembara was announced in which Dasaboja, so named from his ten arms, became Sasraboja* and succeeded in defeating all his rivals. Accompanied by his bride, he now took seat on

the bird Sruvenda and passed through the air towards Maospati. In their aerial progress, the dung of the bird fell in the audience-hall of Ngalengka. Rahvana became very angry and he immediately sent the demon Gutaka, who could also fly, to discover the reason. Marica observed that Arjunavijaya was flying with the princess, whom Rahvana had tried in vain to woo. The demon-king

immediately took an aerial journey to Maospati, while he left instructions to send his soldiers afterwards.

Now it happened that Arjunavijaya was absorbed in deep samadhi and Rahvana came to abduct Secavati. In the ensuing turmoil, one of the wives of Arjunavijaya awakened him. The duel now occurring between Rahvana and Arjunavijaya persisted through seven days and nights.
In the end, Rahvana solemnly promised to behave well in future and escaped with his life. But no sooner had he reached his own city than he forgot his promise. He was chastised again and men came to discern that Sasrabahu was the incarnation of a god. The whole army of Rahvana returned to Ngalengka.

After the episode of Jasadarma and Sasraboja, - the writer of the Serat Kanda takes us to Resi Gutama, who begot three children through his wife Devi Rontah. They were Devi Anjani, Subali and Sugriva. The last two, as the author tells us, were not, properly speaking, their .
children. The amours of Devi Rontah with Surya brought them to earth. Anjani black-mailed her mother and obtained the Book of Charms called the Cupu Manik. She also wanted to possess the box from which hush-money was given by her mother. As this brought about a quarrel, the whole incident came to the knowledge of her father.
Now Gutama threw it of into the sea and declared that the one who would be able to fetch the box from the depth of the sea should be the rightful owner of it.
Anjani gave proxy. But neither her proxy nor- her brother succeeded in bringing the box. As they came above, they saw themselves turned into white apes. Out of revenge, they washed the face of Anjani with the same

204 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

water and she got the face of an ape. Through a curse, her mother was also turned into stone, and Gutama then went to practise austerities on a polished stone. Anjani also took to asceticism and sat on a needle-point in the middle of the sea. Subali sat on a tree and Sumanda, the proxy of Anjani, sat thereunder.

The scene then shifts to another place. We find now Ki Bujut, who got Watu Gunung as his son. As he was.
not blessed with a son of demoniac appearance, he longed for one and the gods gave him Getah Banjaran. The latter robbed Devi Taravati, the daughter of Batara Tantra.
The young woman naturally did not like the demon and ultimately escaped by a stratagem. A duel between the two Don Juans-Rahvana and Getah Banjaran-is then described.

Now Nerada, the messenger of gods, sought for some one who could match the strength of Getah Banjaran.
He discovered Subali performing penances on the branch of a tree. As the reward for his success, Nerada promised him Devi Taravati and gave him the spell called Pancasona, which ensured jdong life. Coming from the sea, Subali began to fight with Getah Banjaran, who was ultimately done away with by means of the charm. This episode also occurs in the Roorda van Eysinga's edition of the Hikaiat Seri Rama'. Thus Subali married Taravati and built a palace through the power of his asceticism. It was.
called Ragastina. Sumanda became his patih and ultimately famous under the name of Jembavan. Sugriva became

patih jero. Now Resi Kala became king of Dravatipurva.
and Gutama went to heaven.

Rahvana once saw Devi Taravati in her pleasure-garden, where she passed her term of pregnancy. As Rahvana came to abduct her, he was defeated by Subali.
Everything, however, was re-adjusted, and Rahvana was

1 It has to be remembered that the editions of Eysinga and Shellabear are not identical, Some new materials occur in both; the edition of Shellahear, however, is more complete.

CH. VIJI] THE LATER RAMAYANAS 2085

accepted as if he were the younger brother of Subali. After returning to Ngalengka, he heard floating rumours about the beauty of the wife of Dafarata, known as Bandondari. He flew through the air to Mandrapura to demand the girl for himself. - Bandondari, however, devised a trick to put dust into the eyes of Rahvana. She created her proto-type from the slough of her body. She was called Bandondariklalar, while the original Bandondari became known under the name of Devi Rago. Now Rahvana came with her to Ngalengka. Dagarata, however, slept with the pseudoBandondari, though he returned home for being favoured with a son through the instrumentality of Begavan Candradeva. Dr. Stutterheim'* says that in many authorities this son was born even before the wife of Dafarata was given away, The episode described above marks a noteworthy agreement with the Malay Hikaiat Seri Rama.

Visnu and Sri now wanted to re-incarnate themselves at Mandrapura, and Basuki wanted to follow them as a companion. - At this time Rahvana appeared there and they had to flee. Visnu escaped by becoming the son of Daf�arata, while Sri transformed herself into the daughter of Bibitsamuka. As she was still pursued, she changed herself into an egg, which was swallowed by Rahvana. The latter then returned home and enjoyed the company of the pseudo-Bandondari. - He vowed that if his wife gave birth to a male child, he must fight with him, and if it was a girl, she must be his wife".

In Mandrapura Balyadaru bore a son ; he was an incarnation of Visnu and was known as Bergava. Rago had also a son called Murdaka, who was an incarnation of Basuki. Dagarata got some more children, of whom the first two were Braganta and Tuvignja. Thereafter Balyadaru bore him Berdona, while Rago got Citradona.

The celestial weapons of Visnu, which were changed

206 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

into animals at the time of his last fight with Rahvana, were again transformed into weapons. The first heroic deed of the young boys was their fight with Jasadarma of Maospati.

Now, Rahvana's wife Devi Kendran got a son called Indrajit. The pseudo-Bandondari gave birth to a girl, who was an incarnation of Sri. Her mother, fearing that she would be married to Rahvana, placed the baby in a chest and set her adrift in the sea. Meanwhile, Cibisana (Vibhisana) obtained a son called Meganada through charms. Rahvana visualised that the boy would once fight with him, and so he flung him on a stone. But the boy lived on. The episode of the drifting baby also occurs in the Hikaiat Seri Rama.

Now, the drifting chest was discovered by Resi kala of Mantili ; he took the girl as his daughter and christened her Sinta. When the .girl grew up, Resi Kala found a bow falling from heaven. He thought that the person who would be able to bend the bow and pierce nine palm-trees should obtain his daughter as a wife. Many kings came from far and near, but none succeeded in the task. At last Bergava came and succeeded in obtaining the prize of the archery-contest. Rahvana, who had succeeded in piercing.
up to six palm-trees, was extremely disappointed. The

Rama kidung Bali* corrupts the already corrupted 5 episode by introducing into it some heroes from the \ Mahabharata. Apparently, the author has confused it with the Svayamuvara of Draupadi; because we fiind here not only Rama and his brothers, but also Duryodhana, Bhima, , Arjuna, etc. The episode in the Rama Nitis is still further . distinet*.

After the marriage ceremony was over, Bergavaaccompanied by his bride and brother Murdaka, proceeded .

home. On their way to the capital, Murdaka took to.
asceticism with Resi Candradeva.

CH. VIII] THE LATER RAMAYANAS 207

The author now describes how Bergava and Sinta were transformed into monkeys. The Malay recension tells us that Rama and Sita one day took bath in a pure pond and they were immediately changed into apes, According to the advise of Laksana, Rama plunged into the impure water and forthwith got his own form. But as Sita was already in labour, she could not bear the ape-son any longer. So her womb was placed in the limb of Devi Anjani, who gave birth to Hanuman. According to the Rama Kidung Bali*, the Rama Kling, etc., Hanuman is likewise the son of Rama and Anjani.

After this, the Javanese Serat Kanda records a change of names. Thus, Bergava became Sri Rama and Murdaka became Lesmana. King Dagarata sent a messenger to bring them home, but they preferred to remain in the woods. Then follows the episode of Lesmana and Sarpakanaka. Lesmana cut off her nose and she, out of shame, did not show her face to anybody. Rahvana noticed her awkward face and immediately despatched Marica and Vilmukabahu to Sita in whom he recognised his long-lost Sri. Then follows the episode of the Kidang Kencana or the golden Kidang. The rough outline of the episode of Gentayu or Jatayu follows the Sanskrit and Kawi versions.

The author then shifts the scene to Kiskenda, where Mahesasura and Jatasura were fighting. At last Jatasura got the better of his enemy and wished to marry Taravati, the daughter of Batara Sakra. Her father sought the help of Subali of Ragastina for fighting out the demon and promised his daughter as the reward. Accordingly Subali went to the hole of Kiskenda and succeeded in killing both the monsters.
But Sugriva snatched off the daughter of Sakra and became the rular of Ragastina. - Subali, however, ultimately succeeded in winning back his wife, who, after some time, became pregnant.

Now Rama, spent with hunger and thirst, was resting himself under the shade of a tree. On the top of the tree

1 Juynboll, Suppl. Cat. Sund, Bal. Sas. Hss., 1912, p. 181.

�208 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

was Sugriva, whose tears welled out in torrents on the bosom of Rama. He got up and made acquaintance with Sugriva, who told him that Rahvana would come to pay his tribute to Subali. - Sugriva now entered into an alliance with Rama and they both set out to kill Subali. On their way to Kiskenda, Rama asked Sugriva to wear wreaths of cocoanut leaves round his neck. This enabled Sugriva to kill Subali. - Now Angada became king of Ragastina, while Sugriva married Devi Taravati,

Rama and Lesmana then began to practise hard austerities on the mountain of Suvela,. The author next presents a short episode of Rama and Anoman, describing how the latter wanted to partake of some food from the dish of Rama. While describing the crossing over to Lanka, both the Serat Kanda as well as the Ramayana Sasaka have introduced some heroes from the Mahabharata. From this stage up to the end of the war, the main outline of these recensions does not materially differ from one another.
About the death of Rahvana, the Serat Kanda has a very curious story to tell. It describes that after the downfall of the mighty demon-king, he was buried half-dead under a huge mountain. Indeed, this makes a noticeable departure from the original Sanskrit version, which records the death of Ravana. The Serat Kanda then describes the fire-ordeal of Sinta, from which she came out in virgin purity. At this stage, the author introduces Bandondariklalar, who was overwhelmed with joy on the discovery of her long-lost baby. The buried Rahvana was frequently creating disturbances and Rama went out to keep a sharp eye on him. Indeed, as the head of Rahvana came out from below the hill, Anoman buried it once more. - Rama now directed his attention to bring order into the administration. - Thus, Dativikrama, son of Cibisana, was consecrated to the sovereignty of Ngalengka ; Sruveni, son of Sakisar, was placed over Indrapura ; Balengkara, son of Balika, held sway over Bruvaspurva. The Hikaiat Seri Rama and the Serat Kanda agree in stating that Rama then carved out a new city. In the summary of Stutterheim,

CH. VIII] THE LATER RAMAYANAS 209

the name of the city is Durjayapura. Now it happened that Devi Gotakju sketched out the portrait of Rahvana on Sinta's fan and placed it on her bed. Rama suspected her to be untrue and sent her to Mantilidirjia. According to the Ramayana Sasaka, when she was accused of infidelity towards Rama, she was ordered to be executed, and not simply banished, as we find in the Sanskrit version.
Laksmana took her to Srenggadikara in the hermitage of Bhagavan Lamba and sent the lungs of a dog instead of Sinta's. - The Serat Kanda then proceeds to describe how Binta gave birth to Butlava while in exile. The child was instructed in the secrets of various sciences by Resi Kala.
In course of time, the boy picked up a quarrel with a pair of demons who were engaged in the service of Cibisana.
They complained to their master as well as to Lesmana, who went straightway to enquire of Sinta. There they were imprisoned by the boy, who brought them both to Mantili.
Here tiley were released by Resi Kala. Lesmana wanted to ~~ take back Sinta with him, but she would not go till her husband came. The poet then describes a lively scene of reconciliation between Sinta and Rama. The next function -which the author presents is the marriage of Butlava with Endrakumala, the daughter of Indrajit and the granddaughter of Devi Kendran of Membang. According to the Ramayana Sasaka, however, Sita had two sons, viz., Botlava and Betlava. In the Sanskrit recension, their names appear as Kuga and Lava. As the Serat Kanda tells us, Butlava became the successor of Rama. - Lesmana and Tvibisana '(Cibisana) went to perform austerities on the hill of Cendana Sekar, while Anoman remained below Kundalisada to keep vigilance over the fallen Rahvana. The author then furnishes us with a graphic description of Rama, Sinta and their associates, who committed themselves to the flames. Among the prominent figures, we notice also the names dof Lesmana, Tvibisana, Sugriva, Angada, Anila, .Srabanila, Sraba and Bisamuka'.

210 THE LATER RAMAYANAS

-� - Itwill appear from the above survey that our present works agree on some points with the Sanskrit and the Kawi-recensions of the Ramayana, but these points are outweighed by the number of variations. - As the authors of these books had to accept some frame-work for their respective compositions, agreement on particular points does not lead us to any valuable result. It is only through the:

consideration of differences that we can hope to be near the original source or sources. To take one instance, in the Hikaiat Seri Rama and the Serat Kanda, Sita has been described as the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari. The same thing occurs in the Siamese Ramakien and in the Uttarapurana of the Jains, written by Gunabhadracarya in the 8th century A.D. In some Buddhist versions also, Sita: is Ravana's daughter. It has been stated in the Adbhuta~ Ramayana that Mandodari conceived her by drinking the blood of rsis. The problem arises, why this particular episode, differing so pronouncedly from the versions of Valmiki and Yogifvara, agree so strikingly with so many non-Brahmanical versions? Has this particular episode to be regarded as the upshot of non-Brahmanical traditions.
current in Indonesia, or has the story travelled from the Archipelago to India? In any case, the story has behind it.
a very long history and must be, at least a millennium older than its Javanese version. There are also several other points which seem to throw back the date of the ultimate source of the Javanese Ramayanas to the early century of the Christian era. The Javanese Ramayanas, like the Padmapurana version of the story, close with the final reconciliation of Sita and Rama. Further, the Javanese Uttarakanda is a separate work, the Sanskrit Balakanda is almost.
lacking in the Javanese versions. When taken together, these points seem to prove that the ultimate source of the Javanese recensions was a work which did not contain the Uttarakanda and the Balakanda, and ended with the reconEuropean languages belonging to the Library of the India office, vol. I, pt. I, 1916, pp. 27, 34.

CH. VIII] THE LATER RAMAYANAS 211

ciliation of Rama and Sita. Such a work must have existed c. 100 B.C.-50 A.D.* It is probable that a work of this character supplied materials to the Old-Javanese paraphrase upon which the kakawin of Yogif�vara has been based. But while the episode of the final reconciliation of Rama and Sita has persisted through many Javanese. recensions, old and new, other episodes betray non-Indian exotic elements, which have been mixed up with indigenous and Indian materials. We have seen before how the figures of the Sanskrit epic have been mixed up with Islamic heroes. This is, at least, understandable. After the introduction of Islam into the Archipelago, there is a break in the continuity of Indo-Javanese history, which brought about a confusion of ideals among the peoples of Java and some other islands. And they began to forget or confuse the true characters of Indian heroes. Many anecdotes, moreover, were invented and incorporated in the so-called later Javanese Ramdayanas. All these factors have been conjointly responsible for the peculier character of many of them. The Ramayana-recensions that were current in Campa and Cambodia might also have some share in the evolution of the Rama-saga of Indonesia.

1 In the Chiness versions of this time, there is no suggestion of the Uitarahkanda.

CHAPTER IX.

ITIHASA OR EPIC WORKS, Contd. -RAMAYANA RECENSIONS IN STONE TEXTS.

While the Javanese poets have described the Ramdyanalegend with their pen, the artists have done the same with the help of the chisel. In the present chapter, we shall offer a description of the Rama-reliefs of the Prambanan, Panataran, Ba Puyon and Angkor Vat group of temples, which have given an enduring colour to the popular Rama-saga. Art criticism is foreign to the purpose of the present work, and we shall merely confine ourselves to the points of agreement and difference of the legend as preserved in these monuments. But before we take up the subject proper, it will be necessary to mention the dates of construction of these monuments as to place the legends in their proper perspective and give them a proper back-ground. '

We have already accepted the Oth century A. D. as the probable date of the Prambanin group. The Panataran temple in East Java has to be placed several centuries later. Dr. J. L. A. Brandes says' that datemark on loose stones ranges between 1197-1454 A. D. An immovable colossal raksasa figure bears the year-mark

1269 Saka. The main temple, happily for us, yields some dates in Saka era, e. g., 1241, 1242 and 1245-which, therefore, fall between 1319-1323 A. D. We can then accept 1319-1454 A. D. as the date of its construction*. According

CH. IX] RAMAYANA RECENSION IN STONE 2183

to the Prea Key inscription', the Ba Puon temple has to be referred to the time of king Jayavarman V, who flourished between 968-1001 A. D. Itis the date of the Angkor Vat group of temples that has thrown a veritable apple of discord among archaeologists and art-critics. No inscription has been discovered that can offer a sure clue to the date of this magnificent structure. Aymonier thought� that the building has to be referred to the time of Suryavarman II, who, we know, ruled between 1112 and c. 1152 A. D. Some have even conjectured that Divakara, the spiritual preceptor of the king, was the architect of this building. According to M. Finot," the complete structure may be placed between 1112-1180 A. D., and we accept this for our present purpose.
There are twenty Ramayana-reliefs at Prambanan,/� which graphically describe the main episodes of the story from the beginning to the advent of Ranta and his allies on the shores of Lanka. According to competent authorities, the story was presumably continued along the balustrade of the

adjoining Brahma temple, but only detached fragments are all that have remained behind. The Ramayana reliefs of the Panataran group begin a little before where the Prambanan reliefs end at the present moment. It is noteworthy that the episodes of the Balakanda, which are almost lacking in the Old-Javanese kakawin, are scantily preserved in the Prambanan-reliefs. Dr. Brandes� doubts if the Balakanda-story was at all continued in the neighbouring Visnu-temple.

At Prambanan, the artists have begun with the story of the deputation of deities, who went to Visnu and found him sleeping on the serpent Ananta. The bird Garuda is

seen offering a blue lotus to Visnu. - According to some scholars, the seated figures on the right flank of the panel' represent God Brahma and others, who went to request him to be incarnated in Rama. Dr. Vogel� thinks that the scene described is similar to that described in Kalidasa's Raghuvam�am. We then notice Vi�vamitra, who comes to pay a visit to king Dagaratha. In the pleasure-garden we find him along with the chief queen, four sons and his daughter?. Dr. Stutterheim says that a daughter of Dagaratha is known from Hikaiats ; in fact, Kakuya is known from Candravati's Bengali Ramayana. But these are much later works. We do not know if any story of India, dated before the Oth century A. D., mentions a daughter of Dafgaratha. Sita is no doubt represented in many versions as Dagaratha's daughter, but if that were so in this case, there would have" been no necessity for the archerycontest in the Prambanan-relief. Dagaratha, however, welcomes tthe ascetic.* - The next scene presents

Rama killing the Tadaka-raksast' All of them then arrive at the cloister of Vi�vamitra and, while Rama defeats the demons, the hermits offer him their homage. As a matter of fact, we find Marica driven into the sea and the other is killed.� The next scene introduces to us Vifivamitra, Laksmana, Rama and king Janaka. Urged by Vi�vamitra, Rama bends the powerful bow and obtains Sita." After the marriage, Rama, Laksgmana and Sita depart for home and they meet Paragurama on the way. The - latter challenges Rama to bend his bow and measures strength

with him.' In the next scene, we find Paragurama has been defeated." In the Musee khmer at Phnom pen' are preserved some paintings of episodes from the Cambodian version of the Ramayana, and they include the discovery of Sita by Janaka, Rama's breaking the bow of Siva and encounter with Paragurama after the marriage-ceremony.
In the bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat, we find in the centre of a panel a young man who is aiming his bow at a target. In this representation of the Khmer artists, we find a birdtarget behind a rotating wheel. In front of the knight with the powerful bow, we find a gorgeously dressed lady.
We find also near-by a Brahmana, whose twisted hair is projected behind. Though the scene would strongly remind one of the svqyamvara of Draupadi, scholars are generally

inclined to take it as the bow-contest at the court of king

jJanaka.* 4

At Prambanan, the artists next describe the question of succession. Dafaratha has decided to nominate Rama as his successor, but Kaikeyi demands the banishment of the eldest son. She wants the sceptre to pass to Bharata." And thus, in the following scene we find Bharata to the throne. In the midst of joys and festivities, the excellent pose of a dancing girl arrests our attention.�� This is in sharp contrast with the following scene," which vividly presents the sorrows of Kau�alya and Dagaratha after the decision was arrived at. We soon find Rama, Sita and Laksmana leaving the capital.} Meanwhile, Dagaratha dies and preparations go a-pace for burning his body.
Kausalya and Bharata are seen busy in giving presents to the in the following relief, we find Bharata

requesting the exiled Rama to be king again. The scene takes place in the woods. Rama refuses to return to the capital, but he gives his younger brother his sandals, which would represent Rama on the vacant throne." In the first part of the next relief, we find that the banished trio are proceeding through the woods. At this stage, Sita was lifted by the ogre Viradha, but she was rescued after strenuous effort.* This scene has also been represented at Angkor Vat. The artist has depicted a forest, in the midst of which we find a raksasa bearing a lady on the left arm. The ogre is contending against two archers, who are, according to M. Coed�s,* no other than Rama and Laksmana. - But the French scholar thinks that the sculptors have not reproduced the scene with much fidelity. The artists of Prambanan depict hereafter some scenes, which do not occur at" Angkor Vat. Because, the next scene which is described at Prambanan is the well-known episode of Rama, Sita, and the crow. We find here that Sita has hung some venison to dry on the branches of a tree. When Sita tries to scare away a crow stealing the venison, the bird attacks her and she flees to Rama. - Rama shoots the Brahmas�tra which follows.
the bird everywhere. The crow submits at last but as the discharged arrow cannot go in vain, the crow allows Rama

to strike out one of its eyes. The head of the bird has broken off* We are next introduced to Surpanakha,

who, transforming herself into a lovely woman, is trying to entice Rama.' In the following scene we find that she has already been sent to Laksmana, who also does not

Rama then shoots the enchanted animal, and the raksasa Marica, coming out of the stricken deer, imitates the voice of Rama. Sita hears this." Immediately after this we find the demon Ravana, who appears in the guise of a Brahmana and carries off Sita. Rice-pot and fly-whisks are also noticeable." The Old-Javanese sculptors have then presented the duel of Ravana and Jatayu, who is worsted in the fight.

The sculptors of the former temple have presented Kavandha in a curious way ; because, in addition to the usual head over the neck, we find here one placed on the stomach. In this respect, the artists of Angkor Vat were more faithful. At Prambanan, we find the celestial being who is now released from the body of the hideous monster. Rama and Laksmana then;

help. At Angkor Vat, the later phase of the story has been laid on a mountain. In the centre, Rama and Laksmana are sitting, while Sugrciva, with a mukifta or royal diadem on the crown, converses with them. M. Coed�s thinks� that Sugriva is swearing fidelity by placing his hand on the bosom. There is an additional scene at Prambanan, which does not occur at Ba Puon and Angkor Vat. It is the representation of Rama, who is giving a proof of his power to . the doubtful Sugriva by shooting an arrow through the stems i; of seven tal-trees."' The duel of Sugriva and Valin are common to reliefs of the above three temples. But the Prambanan reliefs contain an additional episode, which 'we do not find at Angkor Vat and Ba Puon. In the first temple, we find that Rama does not first help Sugriva; because his appearance could not be distinguished from that of Valin.* In consequence, Sugriva is defeated by Valin. On the advice of Rama, he now puts on a wreath of leaves round ff his neck, and this time Valin is killed by an arrow of Rama." The death of Valin is implied at Ba Puon; this is explicitly portrayed in a minor relief at Angkor Vat.� We do not _ find the wreath of leaves in the representation of the Khmer artists." Thus Sugriva becomes king again and regains his wife; the monkeys are seen making festivities." Rama, Laksmana and Sugriva then hold a Council of War." suggests to the princes that leaders of the monkeyhosts, who now sit behind him, should go out in search of Sita. The queens of monkeys are represented here (Prambanan) in human form ; the artists have also introduced a

These scenes do not occur in the reliefs of the Angkor Vat and the Ba Puon group of temples.

We are then introduced to the Afoka-forest by the sculptors of Prambanan, Ba Puon and Angkor Vat. In the bas-relief of the first temple, we find that a female slave is �drawing the attention of Sita and Trijata to the monkey-hero Hanuman, who was concealed in a thicket. Shortly afterwards we find Hanuman conversing with the daughter of

Janaka.� From the descriptions of Dr. Stutterheim,* it is not clear if Hanuman had any insignia of Rama in his hands.

The meeting of Sita and Hanuman has also been represented in the bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat. The interpretation of the

scene by Moura� and Aymonier' was not happy. According to M. Coed�s," the monkeys of Moura are, in fact, hideous

raksasis. - In the centre we find Sita conversing with a little

monkey who is doubtless Hanuman. - M. Cced�s thinks* 'that the other human figure is that of Sarami, the virtuous

wife of Vikhisana. Among the bas-reliefs of Ba Puon,' we also find Sita in the garden of under the strict

vigilance of raksasis. At her right side, we find Hanuman,

who holds in his hand the Cud@amani. The insignia has also .
been depicted by the sculptors of Angkor Vat.

At Prambinan, the episode of the interview of Sita and Hanuman is followed by the capture of the latter by rakgasas. The raksasas are busy dressing rags round the tail of Hanumian.'" - When fire is set to these rags drenched

like a "living torch ".' After burning Lanka, the monkeyhero narrates his experiences to Rama, Laksmana and: Sugriva." because the latter did not devise any means for his crossing of the sea. The frightened sea-god asks him to build

a bridge.' Laksmana, Rama and Sugriva follow - the

Rama is angry with Varuna, God of the sea ;

monkeys, who throw blocks of stone into the sea. Though aquatic animals try to prevent this, the bridge is ready soon. Rama, Laksmana, Sugriva and the monkey-horde now pass over to Lanka, At Angkor Vat, we find Rama and his allies according reception to Bibhisana who had left the side of his brother.* Excepting this scene, all the other major episodes, viz., Hanuman hiding himself in Ravana's garden, the interview of Sita and Hanuman, the burning of Lanka by the fire of Hanuman's tail, his report to Rama, the construction of the bridge, have been more elaborately described in the reliefs of Panataran." It appears that Hanuman's burning of Lanka, the destruction of pleasure-gardens and the fight of Hanuman with the raksasas were the most appealing themes to the Panataran artists.

Now begins the Yuddhakanda of the Ramayana, which is common to the reliefs of Ba Puon, Angkor Vat and Panataran. We find, for example, in a relief at Ba Puon Ravana in a chariot discharging a couple of arrows at Rama. Rama is borne by Hanuman, on whose neck he puts one foot and the other, on his tail. Hanuman also takes part in the combat and injures the human-headed

horse harnessed to the chariot of Ravana. According to M.
Finot,* the duel is an echo from the 59th sarga of the Ramayana (V. 122%. ). The fight of Ravana with Hanuman and Nila has also been described.* The duel of Sugriva and Vajradanstra, Rama fighting from a chariot ( which never occurs in the Sanskrit epic ) with a the various duels of Sugriva and

Kumbhakarna ( Ram., 67, V. 508. ), Sugriva and Mahodara { Ram., 98 ), Rama and Kumbhakarna (Ram., 67, V. 1428), Rama and Makaraksa (Ram., 79 )-all these have been

described. The swords, lances, branches of trees, shields and the numbers of warriors have made the scenes extremely clumsy. The same clumsiness also continues in the Ramayana bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat. According to M. Coed�s,* the fights of Mahodara, son of Pulastya, and Arfigada can be certainly verified from the details supplied by the Sanskrit Ramdyana and the relief in question. - He thinks that the monkey who gives the coup de grace to the raksasa Mahodara is the mighty Nila" Here also we notice the duels between Nila and 'Prahasta�, - Hanuman - and Nikumbha", Sugriva - and Kumkhakarpa� -some of which we have already noticed in the reliefs of Ba Puon. In the Panataran reliefs, the story of the Yuddbakanda is not as monotonous as that of the Khmer artists. According to Dr. Brandes, duel between persons of equal size is a characteristic - trait of relevant Panataran reliefs.

The Ba Puon sculptors have also carved the scene of Rama and Leksmana bound down by the Nagapda�ga-weapon.

snakes sneak away quickly.} The fight of Rama and Ravana is described at Ba Puon as well as at Angkor Vat.
The disconcerting agility of the monkey-hero Nila has been beautifully portrayed in the bas-relief of the latter temple.*" The scene at Angkor Vat, which has been supposed to refer to the fire-ordeal of Sita, has unhappily been mutilated. According to M. Coed�s, it represents.
not the A�vamedha sacrifice of Dafgaratha, but the trial of Sita, and he thinks he has been able to identify the figures of Vibhisana, Sugriva and Hanuman from the relief. The shooting tongues of fire, at any rate, cannot be misunderstood.� Though M. Finot has sought toascribe a particular relief at Ba Puon to this episode.
M. Coed�s thinks it doubtful.' The puspaka car, which was the vehicle of Kuvera, now leads the victorious party back to Ayodhya. It is drawn by harisas or swans, and the decorative motifs are excellent. The scene is preserved both at Ba Puon as well as at Angkor Vat.

Among the detached fragments that have been recovered from the neighbourhood of Prambanan, 'the notable episodes are: march of the monkey army in Lanka, fight of Kumbhakarna and the monkeys and the body of Ravana.

reliefs of Angkor Vat and Ba puon describe the very last phases of Valmiki's Ramayana, those of Prambanan and Panataran stop much earlier. They agree, however, on one point-none of them describes any scene from the Uttarakanda of the Sanskrit Ramayana. As a matter of fact, Javanese sculptors have described the earlier portions of the Ramayana as elaborately as the Khmer artists the later phases. It appears that the artists of Cambodia used a recension of the Ramayana which was akin to the work of Valmiki. The reliefs of Prambanan, however, contain some scenes which find explanation from Malay narratives.
of the subject. In this respect, the Panataran group stands closer to the Old-Javanese kakawin of Yogif�vara, which has many points of agreement with the work of Valmiki. It is clear, therefore, that there were several streams of traditions in Java, Campa and Cambodia. From which regions these came, how they intermingled with each other and separated, taking along some traces and leaving others behind-cannot be determined - at this.

CHAPTER X ITIHASA OR EPIC WORKS, Contd.

THE RAMAYANACYCLE OF STORIES IN KAWI

There are some Kawi-works and many wayang stories, which have been based upon, or inspired by the legends of the Ramayana. Itis not easy to determine, however, which particular recension of the Ramayana was the sure source of 'the writers, who composed beautiful kakawins like the Sumanasantakg, the Arjunavijaya and the Harigraya. From the literary as well as historical point of view, the first mentioned kakawin is a most interesting work, because, it has not only been handled exquisitely in Indian Chandahs, but also because its material seems to be directly derived from - Sanskrit literature. Let us begin our study with the Sumanasantaka, the title of which has been explained as Sumanasa, (i.e. by flower) 'antaka' (i. e. death) i.e. death by flower. It offers an elaborate account of the love-affair of Aja and Indumati, the hero and the heroine of this poem. The young heroine is no other than the mother of Dagaratha and grand-mother of Rama, and her life-history forms one of the most fascinating �chapters of Sanskrit literature. But before we take up the

subject proper, it is necessary to discuss some problems connected with this important Kawi-work.

The book bears some striking similarity with the famous Raghuvam�am of Kalidasa. Dr. Juynbol� supposed therefore that this kakawin is based upon the work of Kalidasa. As the main outline of this story occurs in other Sanskrit works as well, it is necessary to examine the point in some detail.
The first question that faces us is: Was any work of Kalidasa known in Java? Among the works extant in Java and Bali, we do not find any direct evidence to settle the point. The best work of Kalidasa, viz., the Abhijfiana�gakun1 Bijdragen T. L. Vk., 6th Series, VI, pp.

CH. X] RAMAYANA-CYCLE QOF STORIES IN KAWI 225

talam was not known at all, though the story of Sakuntala makes its appearance in the Old-Javanese Adiparva. Dr.
Juynboll himself thinks that the writer's knowledge of Sanskrit was doubtful; because, he has used the word Sumanas not as a synonym for flower, but as the name of a flower.
There are, however, some slight indications in the inscriptions and sculptures of Greater India pointing to the possibility of the existence of some work or tradition akin to that handled in Kalidasa's Raghuvam�am. We have already seen that the first relief of Prambanian, according to Dr.
Vogel, remarkably agrees with relevant passages of Kalidasa's Raghuvamfam. Then again, the episode of Dilipa and his Nandini cow, which has been artistically handled by Kalidasa, - has been - referred to in an - inscription of Cambodia'. As possibilities and impossibilities are equally matched at thepresent moment, we shall try to evaluate the internal evidences of the three works, viz., the Sumanasantaka, the Raghuvam�am and the Padmapuranam, all of which have described the same story.
Our survey will be limited to the study of differences.

The Sumanasantaka kakawin differs from both the Sanskrit works on some important points. - The Raghuvam@a and the Padmapurana�* versions of the story present the episode of Harini: and Trnavindu towards the closing portion of the main story. In the kakawin, this episode has been used as an introduction to the main frame-work of the story. The Sumanas@ntaka kidung, however, though a later work than the kakawin, has placed that episode towards the close." In the Raghuvam�am and the Padmapuranam again, the name of the father of the Gandharva-prince is

1 1.8.0.C., p. 398; Kalidasa himself says in the Raughuram�am {VI, 57) :"Anena - sardham _- vihar-amburage=stiregu talivana-marmaregu Dvipantar=anitalavanga-puspari= rapakpyta-szedalard marudbhih."

This is probab'y a direct allusion to the Spice Islands.

Priyadar�ana; in the Sumanasantaka his name appears a Citraratha. Further, the name of sage Matanga, which occurs in both the Sanskrit works, has been changed into Patanga in the Old-Javanese work. Then again, the charmed missile, which was given by the grateful Gandharva prince to Aja, is called 'Prasvapana' in the Padmapuranam, 'Sammohana' in the and 'Vimohana' in the Sumanasantaka. As these points record noticeable deviations, we cannot definitely accept any work as the sure source of the Kawi-work. It seems probable, however, that there were different recensions of this story in India as well as in Indonesia. In addition to the above evidences, which seem to distinguish one work from the other, we have the testimony of Hemadri,* a good interpreter of Kalidasa, to the effect that the Sanskrit Ramayana formed the main source of the Raghuvam�am from cantos 9 to 15, while the remaining portions were based on "other traditions" '. - We cannot say if these "other sources"" were utilised by Mpu _ Monaguna, the writer of the Sumanasantaka," who, according to Dr. Juynboll, knew no Sanskrit.

The date of the work presents some difficulties. In the last song" of the SumanasiGntaka, the poet speaks of one Sri Varsajaya. We shall have to see if he was a king at all and, if so, where he ruled. In the sixty-third canto of the Krsngyana, the poet refers to one king Varsajaya. - From inscriptions we do not get any information of any Varsajaya, but there is a record of king Sri Jayavarsa Digjaya Sastraprabhu, dated 1104 A.D.
From the find-place of the inscription it appears that he was the ruler of a part of Kediri*. The transposition of the name throws some difficulty in the way of identification. But the

CH. X] RAMAYANA-CYCLE OF STORIES IN KAWI 227

identification seems to receive some support from the Wawatekan, which gives 1098 A.D. as the date of its authorship. So, three points stand out clearly: (a) the author speaks of a Varsajaya ; (b) a Jayavarsa is known to rule in 1104 A.D. and (c) the Wawatekan reference gives 1098 A.D. We can, therefore, assume tentatively as there is no evidence to the contrary-that the work was composed in the reign of Jayavarsa, say c. 1104 A.D, It is possible that the discovery of some inscriptions in future may push back the reign of Jayavarsa to 1098 A.D. and thus confirm the date furnished by the Wawatekan. If our arguments for the date of the Old-Javanese Ramayana be accepted, he would be a contemporary of Yogisvara.
._ The book runs into 180 cantos and has been exquisitely handled in various Sanskrit Chandahs. The story of this book* is as follows :- a

Harini, a celestia nymph, was sent down by Indra to seduce the Brahmana Trnavindu *, who was undergoing austere penances on the earth. In Sanskrit as well as in Javanese-Balinese literature, the task of alluring ascetics has frequently devolved on Rambha, Tilottama, Urvasi, Suprabha and other celestial courtesans. The astute Brahmana, however, being a seer himself, clearly saw through her . plans and cursed" her that she would be born as a daughter of KrathakeSika, the king of Vidarbha. The only redeeming feature was that after the birth of a child to her, she would be killed by the throw of a flower, and then bid adieu to the mortal world. Apart from the incident of the flower,

228 RAMAYANACYCLE GF STORIES IN KAWLI

there are many stories in Sanskrit which represent nymphs shuffling off their mortal coil after the birth of a child.* So, the nymph Harini was born as Indumati,*" who was destined for Aja, the hero of the poem. The princess grew up in alluring splendour and beauty and became of marriageable age. Bhoja, who succeeded his father on the throne, announced a svayamuvara� for her marriage.
The 2lIst sarga of the Sumanasantaka corresponds to the Aja-svayamvarabhigamanah of the Raghuvam�am, i.e. the fifth canto. The 27th sargaof the Javanese work betrays some Wayang influence.

On his way to Vidarbba, Aja sportingly killed an elephant and it turned out to be an incarnation of Gandharva Priyamvada, son of Citraratha. The Gandharva prince stated that he was turned into that condition as the result of a curse of the sage Patanga. As Aja relieved him of his animal-figure, the grateful Priyamvada gave him some charms and the missile called 'Vimohana' (i.e., Vimohanastra ) i.e., the - enchanting weapon.t Aja received the celestial weapon and proceeded to take part in the svayamvara. Besides Aja, there were many other kings who had come to win the hand of Indumati, and among them we find the sovereigns of Magadha, Anga, Avanti, Anfipa� and Susena�. The choice of Indumati fell on Aja, and the poet describes this in the 109th canto of his work. It corresponds to the sixth sarga of Kalidasa's Raghuvam�am. After the svayamvara was over, while Aja was turning towards his capital with .the newly-wedded bride, the disappointed lovers attacked him. The Vimobana@stra given by the Gandharva-prince stood him in good stead and he easily defeated his enemies." From the 109th sarga to the 161st, the story of Monaguna agrees

on - essential points with its Indian counterpart. After the death of Raghu," the father of Aja, the crown-prince was consecrated to the throne and the august ceremony on that occasion is described in the 16ist canto of the Sumanasantaka. The story then recounts the birth of * which was destined to fulfil the curse of the ascetic, whom Indumati had tried to beguile in her former life. Eight years after the birth o her child," while Aja and Indumati were passing their time in a pleasure-garden, the rsi Narada was going to keep an engagement along with his musical instruments. To one end of it was attached a chaplet of flowers, which was thrown against the breast of Indumati by the Divine musician, and it instantly caused her death.* In the work of Kalidasa, the frivolous wind has also a share in the guilt. When Dasaratha grew up and ascended the throne," Aja went #0 the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna and died there.} Then at last he was united with Indumati or Harini in the pleasuregarden of Nandana." The book ends with the following corrupt Sanskrit verses: '"'Om Ganapatayai namah, om Sarasvatyai namah, om sarvadevebhya@ namah svaha, om dirghayur astu tat astu subham om vijayanti."

The kakawin Harigraya, according to Dr. Friederich, is based upon the Old-Javanese Uttarakanda. Cod. 3888 (2) of this work may be described in the following manner : It is stated in the beginning of the work how the gods were threatened by Malyavan, the king of Lengka ( Lanka ) and his brothers, viz., Mali and Sumali. They took counsel from the learned Brhaspati and the latter advised Indra to lead their deputation to Siva, who, he hoped,

would find out a way for them. And so, in the ViIth canto we find the deputation waiting on Lord Siva, who advised them to go to Visnu. Visnu gladly consented and a war was declared against the raksasas. According to Dr.
Juynboll, many of these raksasa's names have been borrowed from the Ramayana.* Thus we find that in canto Xl, verse 4, occur the names of Bajramusti and Virupaksa-names, which also occur in the Ramayana, cantos XIX, 8-9 and XX, 29-34. Among other names, we find Dhamraksa, Praghasa, Akampana, etc. Vispu was finally able to kill Mali� and whereupon Sumali fled to Lengka and thence to the Nether world.* The gods who had fallen on the battlefield were revived by Visnu, who sprinkled amrta over their mangled bodies. After his duties were over, he again returned to heaven."

There are some, other recensions of this work : but they differ more in form than in contents. Cod. 4235 of this work contains 54 cantos. If it is based upon the Uttarakanda, it cannot be older than the 13th century A. D., which we provisionally accept as the date of the Old-Javanese prosework, viz., the Uttarakanda.

The book Arjunavijaya, according to Friederich, is partly based upon the Old-Javanese Uttarakanda. It describes how Arjuna Sahasravahu defeated Ravana, the king of

. Lanka. He could not, however, kill him ; because, it was settled by Providence that he would be killed by Rama, the hero of the Ramayana. This episode has also been described in the Visnupuranam.� Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Surpanakha, whose birth has been described in the Ist canto of this kakawin, are prominent figures of the Ramayanas.

The Arjunavijaya� betrays some Buddhistic influences.

The author of this book, Mpu Tantular, who flourished in the reign of Hayam Wuruk, was a member of the Northern Church. Dr. Krom* says that the Arjunavijaya was composed later than the Nagarakrt@gama (1365 A. D.). This appears quite plausible from the following considerations. We find in the Arjunavijaya that the poet's patron is Ranamangala, son of the king's half-brother and son-in-law of the king's youngest sister. This princess was not married at the time of the Nagarakrtagama. We can, therefore, accept c. 1378 A.D. as the date of its composition. The Wawatekan codifier has thus given us a very wrong date, viz., 1031 Saka.

CHAPTER Xl

ITIHASA OR EPIC WORKS, Contd.
THE MAHABHARATA |

The Javanese Mahabharata, though voluminous, is less bulky than the Indian one. A large number of kawi-works, e. g., the Indravijaya, Bhimasvarga, Arjunaviviha, Parthayajfia, Gatotkacasraya, Harivijaya, Bharatayuddha, Krs3aayana and some other works of this category have been inspired by this Great Epic of India. It exerted such a tremendous influence on contemporary and subsequent literature that very few have escaped making direct or indirect allusions to the stories of the Mahabharata. As in India, so also in Java and Bali, this book has served as a beacon-light to the religious-minded people ; it has offered romantic themes to the kawi-writers and above all, along with the Sanskrit Ramayana, it has laid the real foundation of the Indo-Javanese literature. To this great work of antiquity, therefore, we should now turn our attention,.

There are several recensions of the Old-Javanese Mahabharata, discovered by Van Eck, Van der Tuuk, Dr.
Kern and others from different parts of Bali, Java and Lombok. As there is no striking dissimilarity among these works, we may regard them, for all practical purposes, as.
one recension. After: a few books of the Old-Javanese Mahabharata were discovered, some Dutch scholars, who were interested in the subject, launched a systematic.
research work on this topic. In 1849, Dr. Friederich published his 'Voorloopig verslag van het eiland Bali, in which he cursorily noticed some books of the Old-Javanese recension. From that year up to 1877, no serious work was.
undertaken by any Dutch scholar on this interesting subject ; but in the latter year appeared Prof. Kern's 'Over de

CH. XIj THE MAHABHARATA 233.

Oudjavaansche - vertaling van het Mahabharata in which he not only translated some parts of the Posfyacarita, but also discussed the character, date and form of the Old-Javanese translation.* In 1893, came the important work of Dr. H. H. Juynboll, 'Drie Boeken van het Oudjavaansche Mahabharata in - kawi-iekst en _ Nederlandsche vertaling, vergeleken met den Sanscrit tekst'. In this work, he offered not only a Dutch translation of the 15th, 16th and 17th books of the Mahabharata, but also discussed their

forms, grammar and general characteristics,. This has ushered in a period of sound research work on the interrelation of the Javanese and Sanskrit recensions of the

Indian Mahabharata. , The Mahabharata is divided into 18 books, and, in the �

island of Bali, it goes by the name of Astadagaparva. Even in some corrupted lists furnished by Old-Javanese works, the orthodox number has been maintained. Cod. 4367, for example, offers the names of Srama (Agrama), Santika, Bujanga, Udyoga, Svargarohanaparva, Bhisma, Drona, Krpa, Salya, Karnaparva, Prastaning, Asvatama, Stri, Moksala, Gada, Viratparva, Adiparva and Gadaviraparva*�! There is a different list in the Old-Javanese work called Koravagrama. Again, in an introduction to the Old-Javanese Adiparva, - composed in Vasantatilaka chandah, the names of the 18 books of the Mahabharata have been clearly enumerated. They are Adi, Sabha, Vana, Virata, Udyoga, Bhisma, Drona, Karna, Salya, Gada, Sauptika, Stri, Santi, A�vamedhika, Asramavasika, Mausala, Mahaprasthanika and the Svargarohanika. Besides this, there are two other lists in the Old-Javanese Adiparva, but they, it should be noted, furnish the names of 17 books only. The importance of the first list given in Vasantatilaka measure is further countenanced by the frequent use of 'Astadafgaparva' in

234 THE MAHABHARATA

different parts of the work, and this seems to suggest the original classification of the Mahabharata. From the first list, it appears that there was no room for the Anugasanaparva or at any rate, that it was merged in the Santiparva. The actual number of books is hopelessly discrepant in Indiathe South-Indian text having as many as 24 parvans. We like to observe, therefore, that the list coming from an unprejudiced quarter beyond the seas, must have some intrinsic value of its own. It is quite probable that the arrangement of books we obtain from the Vasantatilaka Chandah was the basis of the original classification, which has been spoilt at different literary centres of India at a subsequent period.

Prof. Kern is of opinion that the Adi, Virata, Udyoga and the Bhismaparva of the Old-Javanese recension must have been composed before the 13th century A. D. Dr.
Juynboll supposed some of these books to have been written in the reign of Airlangga, who flourished towards the beginning of the llth century A. D. According to Dr. Hazeu, the Adiparva of the Old-Javanese recension was composed in the middle of the 10th century A. D., and, conjointly with the Bharatamafijari of Ksemendra, was based upon -one common original, which must have existed in North-western India before the 10th century A. D. Some of these books have referred to Sri Dharmmavam�$�a teguh Anantavikramottungadeva, and it appears, that, by his orders the prose-translations of the Adi, Virata and the Bhismaparva - were effected by some - unknown - author.
The combined testimony of the Javanese and the Balinese records and the Sivagasana� indicate that he was ruling towards the close of the 10th century. A. D.
Though the Old-Javanese Adiparva mentions his son-in-law

Airlangga, it has been suggested by Dr. Krom that the patron in question was no other than Anantavikrama, the predecessor of king Airlangga.* The Old-Javanese Virataparva was probably composed about 996 A. D., as has been suggested by one of its statements.� - Similar is the case with the Old-Javanese recension of the Bhismaparva, which, too, was undertaken during the reign of this liberal king. One MS. of this book mentions him with the title, 'king of Medang,"'* and, apparently, he is identical with the one referred to in the Siva��a@sana. Anantavikrama, king of East Java, i.e., king of Medang, should, therefore, be regarded as the patron of three important epic works. In this respect, he is an exact prototype of the Bengal king Husein Shah (1494-1525 A. D.), who patronised with a catholic spirit the translation of the Sanskrit epics into the Bengali language.* About the Udyogaparva, we cannot furnish a precise date, though it appears probable that king Airlangga maintained the liberal tradition of his great father-in-law and had this book composed during his reign. We can tentatively assume the hypothesis of Dr. Juynboll that this book was composed in the beginning of the 11th century A. D.

Of these four parvas, the Adiparva and the Virataparva formed the main source of the wayang-purva stories, while the Udyogaparva and the Bhismaparva supplied materials for the first part of the Bharatayuddha, an independent kawi-work on the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The story of the Churning of the Milk-Sea, which occurs both in the Sanskrit as well as in Javanese Adiparva, has been accepted in a large part of Greater India as a rich legacy from Hindu culture. The theme has been requisitioned by a large number of Kawi-writers, but

of them we shall speak more fully later on. Dr. Hazeu says* that the Old-Javanese work can very distantly be connected with, or related to, the South Indian and the Bombay recensions, while there are many points of resemblance between the Old-Javanese Adiparva and texts in the Bharatamafijari of Ksemendra. A perusal of his.
interesting paper would lead us to think that he is probably right.

Of the Old-Javanese Adiparva, we have one MiddleJavanese recension in Tengahan metre, and one Balinese recension in Macapat metre. Some Mss. of the Adiparva end with the formula, Namo Buddhaya.* A different Ms.
closes the book with, 'Om namo V agis�varaye Mahavagigvaye, Om gmung Ganapataye namah, om �&ri Gurupadukebhyoh namah." They probably indicate the religion professed by the copyists, who were employed to re-write the worn-off lontar-records on newer materials, and, after their labour was finished, they added those colophons.

We shall now give a summary* of the Old-Javanese prose-translation of the Sanskrit Adiparvan.
*" Cod. 3127 of this book opens with, ''Tatra vam�am aham pirvam grotum icchanti (=icchami) Bhargava." - So begins.
the history of Pauloma, to whom the Sanskrit Paulomaparvan has been devoted. It states that on one occasion, while her husband Bhrgu was away, she was assailed by a raksasa, She was ultimately saved by her son Cyavana, who fell from her limbs. Agni, who protected the raksasa, was cursed by Bhrgu, and became Sarvabhaksa, i.e., the

devourer of all things. This is followed by the story of Ruru, the beloved of Pramathana (Skt. Pramadvara). As the latter was killed by snake-bite, Ruru re-animated her by contributing the half of his life to Pramathana. Dr.
Juynboll thinks* that there is a hiatus after the story of Ruru.
Our Sanskrit text, however, goes forward to fill up the gap and states that Ruru killed all snakes that he came across till they dreaded him. The Javanese text once again begins with the history of Jaratkaru, which, as has been pointed out, occurs twice in the Sanskrit text (Slokas 10251068 ; 1813-1932). Dr. Juynboll is quite right in thinking that in the Old-Javanese translation, the latter portions of the story in the Sanskrit text have been followed ; because, the corrupt Sanskrit verse occurring in fol. a, 27, "ko bhavantah 'valamante wiranastambam agritah " corresponds to sloka 1818 of the Calcutta recension. kbhe Javanese text states that Jaratkaru led a celibate life, and the spirits of his forefathers admonished him to marry so that they could attain salvation with the birth of a child. Thereupon Jaratkaru married his namesake, the sister of Vasuki, king of dragons.
Later on, he left her. The son of this couple is Astika, to whom the Astikaparvan of the Sanskrit Adi has been devoted. Fol. a, 32 begins the history of Kadru and Vinata.
Kadru is the mother of the Nagas, Vinata of Aruna and Garuda. - Aruna cursed his mother ; because, she had opened the egg in her impatience and thus brought him into the world as a maimed one. Vinata thus became the female-attendant of Kadru, mother of the Nagas. Fol.
a, 34 relates the story of the Churning of the Milk-Sea, which yielded Amrita or the nectar of life. The gods received Amrta and became immortal. The demon Rahu also wished to partake of this nectar, but Visnu cut of his head which henceforward became the devourer of the Sun and the Moon. Fol. 37 states how Vinata became the female-attendant of Kadra, to whom she had lost a bet.
As the Nagas did not like to follow the advice of their

238 THE MAHABHARATA

mother, Kadra cursed them with the verse, '"Sarpasatre vartamane pavako va - pradar�gati," which, as Dr.
Juynboll points out, corresponds to sloka 1196. Fol. 38 begins with the history of Garuda, who, as has been pointed out, also plays an important role in the Malay literature.
It was destined at first, female attendant as his mother was, that he should protect the Nagas ; but, it was afterwards settled, that when he would be able to bring in Amrta for the Nagas, the slavery of his mother would cease. This he faithfully carried out by overcoming the sentinel-gods.
Visu, who was pleased with his prowess, made him his v�hana or carrier, and gave him the boon that snakes would form his principal victuals. This part of the Astikaparva is known in the Sanskrit text as Sauparnaparvan. Fol.
48 describes how Naga Sesa was ordered to bear the burden of the whole world. Fol. 57, a, begins the story of the Sarpasatra or snake-sacrifice, which was performed by Janamejaya to avenge the death of his father Pariksit, who was killed by Naga Taksaka. The frightened snake resorted to the shelter of Indra, who, however, could not offer any material aid to him. Atlength he was saved by Astika,

who first got permission to receive a boon from Janamejaya.
The boon Astika asked was to stop the snake-sacrifice, which, according to the king's promise, was immediately stopped. Fol. 61 begins anew story, which runs parallel to the Sanskrit Adivam��avataranaparvan. It describes how the seed of Uparicara fell into the waters of the Yamuna and how a fish swallowed that and became the mother of two children, one of whom was Satyavati, better known as Durgandhini for the smell of her body. The sage married her ; the nauseating scent being removed from her person, she now became known as Sayojanagandhini.
The fruit of their married-love was Vyasa, the codifier of the Mahabharata and hero of the Javanese Wayang story called Abiasa. Fol. 65, a, handles a new theme, which is known in the Sanskrit text as Sambhavaparvan: It has been stated.
that after Paragurama extirpated the Ksatriyas, gods and demons descended on the earth to incarnate in the heroes.

CH. XI] THE MAHABHARATA 239

of the Mahabharata. - Thus, Brhaspati became Drona ; Anantabhoga-A�vatthaman ; Dvapara-Sakuni ; the Maruts -Drupada, - Krtavarman, etc. ;- Dharma-Yudhisthira ; Vayu-Bhima ; Soma-Abhimanyu ; Agni-Dhrstadyumna ; Vasuki-Valadeva ; Sri-Draupadi and so on. Fol. 66 of the Javanese Adiparva begins the famous story of Dusyanta and Sakuntala. Dr. Juynboll* points out that this story agrees in some respects with the celebrated drama of Kalidasa.
The story of Durvasa and the 'abhijfiana'-ring does not occur in the Old-Javanese Adiparva, which depicts it in a simpler way than Kalidasa does. Fol. 74, a, offers a graphic description of Yayati and states how the gods sent Kaca to the Brahmana Sukra for the purpose of learning sciences. As in Sanskrit, he was thrice killed by the Daityas, but each time he was re-animated by Sukra on the intercession of his daughter Devayany, who passionately loved Kaca. As he did not respond to the love of the girl, the latter cursed him and this, too, was returned by him.
The story proceeds to describe how she quarrelled with Sarmistha, the daughter of the Daitya-king Vrsaparvan, and was thrown into a well by the latter. Devayani was ultimately saved by Yayati. Sukra enraged at this insult threatened that he would leave the kingdom of V rsaparvan, who, therefore, was constrained to offer Sarmistha as a female-attendant of Devayani. The daughter of Sukra was ultimately married to Yayati, who, by her, begot two sons, viz, Yadu and Turva�u. In spite of the protestations of Devayani, Yayati got three sons through Sarmistha, viz., Drubyu, Anu and Puri. As Yayiati thus violated a pledge he had made before, Sukra cursed him and he was afflicted with old-age. This he wanted to transfer to his sons, four of whom refused his request and were cursed by Yayati. The author states that the Yadavas originated from Yadu, the Yavanas from Turva�u, the Bhojas from Druhyu, and the Mlecchas from Anu. Puri, who succeeded his father, became the progenitor of the Kauravas and the Pandavas.

240 THE MAHABHARATA

Yayati now comes to heaven, buthe is again thrown down on the earth for his arrogant demeanour. By leading a virtuous life, he again came back to heaven. The story of Santanu and that of the Pandavas is also briefly noticed up to the burning of the Khandava forest.

The Virataparva,* as we have said before, was composed about 996 A.D., during the reign of king Anantavikrama. The book was, no doubt, very popular in Java, because, many lakons and wayang stories have been derived from this book. The Jagal Abilava and part of the Obong-Obongan Bal� Si Galagala are doubtless borrowed from this work.
The name Abilava may appear curious to Indian readers, but when the term is explained as a corruption of Vallabha, the name assumed by Bhima in Viratanagara, our readers, we presume, will no doubt feel amused. Like the Indian Hercules in Viratanagara, there are many epic heroes who are living in disguise in the literature of Java and Bali !
The book contains some pure, and many corrupted, Sanskrit Slokas, and their number is not less than sixty-two. The number will be appreciably augmented if we count single verses also. It should be noted, however, that many verses and prose-texts are not complete in Sanskrit. We cull here a few Sanskrit Slokas from the Old-Javanese Virataparva, and they may serve to show the extent of corruption that prevailed in these Slokas in Java during the last decade of the 10th century A. D. Besides, we should also note the occasions, which necessitated their introduction into the book. On this point, we shall say something later on. The

book opens, as is natural with Javanese writers, with 'Avighnam astu', and this benedictory formula is then followed by the following corrupted Sanskrit sloka, which

makes an eulogistic reference to EKrsnadvaipayana, the crestjewel of the It runs as follows :1 There are many Mss. of this book in the Libraries of Leiden and Batavia; they are codices 4682, 4681, 4683, 5027, 5103, 855, �59b, 986, 3188. Vide Juynboll , Wirataparwa, Introduction.

Cod. 4681 of this book contains the following Sanskrit sloka, which we also come across in the Calcutta-recension of the Sanskrit Mahabharata :''Katham Viratanagare mama purvapitamahah Ajfiatavasam usita Duryodhanabhayardhitah""�

It will not be proper for us to quote more Sanskrit glokas in a general work of this nature. We only draw the attention of our readers to the fact that these verses can not be later than 996 A. D., and hence, they car to a certain extent control similar verses of the Sanskrit Mahabharata. Though rampant corruption has minimised much of their intrinsic merit, we can, at any rate, fix with their help the latest date of the parallel glokas in the Indian recensions of the Sanskrit Mahabharata. According to Dr. Schrieke,} the OldJavanese Virataparva stands closer to the South-Indian than to the North-Indian recension of the same. T

Having considered some characteristics of the OldJavanese Virataparva, we shall now proceed to give a brief account of its contents, The opening words, as Dr. Juynboll notes, agree with the Sanskrit �lokas, which Yudhisthira had said to Arjuna (�loka 14ff). The answer of the latter corresponds to Sanskrit sloka, no. 20, though the translation of the Javanese author is rather free. The next scene introduces us to the five Pandava heroes and Draupadi, who, assuming various names and disguises, wended their way towards the city of Virata. Fol. 7, a, states that they

242 THE MAHABHARATA

concealed their weapons in a Sami-tree, and binding a carcase thereto (so that nobody would come near), they entered the city. Yudhisthira entered as a poor Brahmana, expert in the game of dice ; Bhima then entered as a cook of Yudhisthira, and proclaimed his prowess as a wrestler ; Arjuna then came in female-dress as a eunuch.
Sahadeva declared him as a physician of cows, Nakula further pretending that they had served Yudhisthira.
Draupadi was also employed as an attendant of queen Sudesna. Everything moves on smoothly till fol. 15 introduces us to Kicaka, brother of Sudesna and commanderin-chief of the king. The loveliness of Draupadi excited the passions of Kicaka, who wanted to possess her. Being troubled by the latter, Draupadi fled to Virata. The enraged Bhima was spurred to fury, and were it not for the timely beackoning of Yudhisthira, Kicaka would have then and there paid the penalty with his life. The elder Pandava suggested that in proper time, she would be helped by her Gandharva husbands. In fol. 24, Bhima consoles Draupadi by saying that Kicaka would be killed in a rendezvous.
Indeed, he killed him so horribly that the guards who saw him, exclaimed, "kvasya griva, kva caranau," etc, meaning, 'where is his neck, where are his feet!" - Draupadi answered that he has been killed by the Gandharvas. The blood-relations of Kicaka, known as the Upakicakas, now determined to burn her along with Kicaka. Being implored by Draupadi, Bhima enters the scene as a Gandharva, and after setting her at liberty, did away with the 105 Upakicakas,. - Draupadi is now accused by Virata, who told Sudesna to send her off. She, however, obtained permission to remain for 13 days more. Fol. 32, a, gives some details of the Kauravas, who had sent spies in all \ directions to discover the whereabouts of the Pandavaheroes. Through these spies, the Kauravas came to learn that Sugarman, king of the Trigartas, was making preparations to invade the kingdom of Virita, and they now wanted to make a common cause with him. So the king of the Trigartas fell upon the cow-boys, and robbed them of

CH. XT] THE MAHABHARATA | 213

their animals. Virita then sought the help of the four Pandavas. Arjuna was left out in consideration of his being a eunuch. Fol. 39 states how Virata was taken prisoner and how this created an opportunity for the Pandavas to show their valour in the main theatre of the

war. The author describes here that Yudhisthira killed 1000 soldiers, Nakula 700, Sahadeva 300. Bhima, however,

worked havoc in the army of Sugarman. Ultimately, Virata was released by Bhima, and king Sugarman was taken as the prize of the war. Thus the cows were again brought back from the clutches of the enemy. As a reward of their bravery, Virita wanted to consecrate Yudhisthira to the throne, but the latter declined this honour.
Thus the army of king Virata returned to the city triumphant. Fol. 43, a, states that the Kauravas had meanwhile forcibly taken back the cows from� the awe-stricken cow-boys, who now solicited the help of Bhiamifijaya, son of Virata. The latter exclaimed that he would kill all the Kauravas if only he had a good charioteer. Draupadi recommended Vrhannala to him. Dr. Juynboll observes that the story has got a hiatus here, which, however, can be filled up from Sanskrit sources. We find in the Indian text that the prince here promises rich booty to the ladies.
The Javanese story now pursues the main theme once again. Arjuna, finding that Bhumifijaya has become frightened at the prospect of the actual war, admonishes him that women of the city would laugh at him if he returned from the field defeated. The prince would not hear him and jumped down from the chariot to fly off.
Arjuna brought him back and, breaking the story of his identity to the trembling prince, now resumed command of the war. He first went to bring down his weapons from the Sami-tree, and after explaining the significance of his other names, sounded his conch, named Devadatta.
The Kauravas became now apprehensive, as they knew the familiar sound of the conch. Bhisma now arranges Kuru army in a fighting order. The author now describes his fight with the Kauravas, particularly with Krpa (fol. 56244 THE MAHABHARATA

58), Drona and Asvatthaman (fol. 59-61), Karna and Bhisma, Duryodhana and Vikarna (fol. 62) and some others. Fol.
65 describes how Duryodhana fled from the battle-field, and how Arjuna insultingly called him: '"Megham tam idam bhuvi namadheyam Duryodhana," i.e., then unjust is your name Duryodhana on the earth! The interpretation given here of the name of Duryodhana is, 'one difficult to be fought with." So, Bhisma, Drona, Krpa and others rushed to help Duryodhana but they felt giddy for being struck with a charm-weapon of Arjuna. Arjuna says to Bhisma, "kva te gata buddhi, abhit kva viryam, now your intellect, and your prowess !
This Ms. of the Virataparva ends here abruptly. We can, however, fill up the gap with the help of Sanskrit texts, which describe how Arjuna returned victorious from the battlefield and threw of his incognito. Then follows the marriage of Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, with the

* %

i.e., where are

princess of Virata, named Uttara.

The Old-Javanese Udyogaparva, which we propose to discuss now, opens with: "(Ma)kadya(dya)ngga ni(ng) pang nikang kayu-kayu, hania(w)wah hana tanpa(w)wah."* These words, as has been pointed out, are translations of the Sanskrit �Sloka: "Phaliphalavati �@khe yathaikasmin vanaspatau.' These words were said by Satyaki. It is a f great misfortune to us that a long hiatus has occurred here.

g The Sanskrit text, however, states in this place that Krsna

Y

' would remain neutral, while Valadeva would cultivate friendliness with the Kauravas. The Pandavas now held a council of war, in which they discussed the measures to be taken in connexion with the prosecution of the war.
Krsna then repaired to Dvaravati, where his succour was sought after both by Duryodhana as well as Arjuna (fol. 3).
Krsna promised that he would lend an army of Gopalas to the Kauravas and himself become the charioteer of Arjuna. Salya was thinking of joining the side of the Pandavas, but he was so well-received in the camp of

1 According 'to the reconstructed text of Juynboll.

CH. XI] THE MAHABHARATA 245

the Kauravas that he had to join that side for the sake of prestige. He, however, intimated to the Pandavas that Karna would be betrayed by him in course of the war.
And in this connexion, he described a story, which corresponds to the Indravijaya of the Sanskrit text to illustrate the victory of virtue and the downfall of the unrighteous.
This story * runs up to fol. 21, where we revert to the story of the Kauravas. The Kauravas sent Safijaya to the Pandavas with a view to ascertain the nature of their demands. In the Sanskrit Mahabharata, this part is known as the Safijayayanaparva. Fol. 25, a, introduces us to Dhrtarastra, who sought the advice of Vidura. In the Sanskrit text, this is known as the Prajagaraparva. In this portion of the Javanese work, there are many references from relevant passages of the Sanskrit Mahabharata.
Not satisfied with the advice of Vidura, Whrtarastra sought instructions from Sanatkumara, and this subject forms the nucleus of the Sanatsujataparva of the Indian text.
Fol. 39, a, describes the return of Safijaya and his report regarding the demand of the Pandavas. Though Vidura Krpa, Bhisma and others stood for peace, they were silenced by the militant tone of Duryodhana and Karna.
Dhrtarastra heard their deliberations. With fol. 53 we again turn to the story of the Pandavas, who despatched Krsna to bring about the much-desired peace. In the Sanskrit text, this portion has rightly been designated the Bhagavadyanaparvan. - Yudhisthira first enunciated the nature of his demands and described the cities he wanted. Krsna presented the case of the Pandavas, and Dhrtarastra (fol. 62 ) implored his sons to follow the advice of Krsna. The Kauravas, however, did not pay any attention to the advice of their old father. Krsna had a conversation with Kunti after the assembly broke up for that day. On fol. 71 we find Krsna again dis1. As we are merely indicating the outline of the Javanese Udyogaparva, we leave out the details of the story. It may be seen, however, in the Calcutta reconsion, flokas 228-565.

charging his monotonous duty, but without any appreciable result. In the assembly there were many sages, and of them, Jamadagnya now relates the story of Dambhodbhava ( cf. Skt. sSlokas 3452-3500), who had declared himself mightier than Naranarayana, - and was consequently humbled. The moral which the sage drew was that Duryodhana would likewise be overwhelmed. Fol. 80 presents us to sage Kanva, who pursues further the theme of Jamadagnya and relates the story of daughter of Indra's charioteer Matali. The thread is spun further from fol. 93 with a new story related by Narada, describing the promotion of Vif�vamitra from the status of a Ksatriya to a Brahmana. It also states how Vi�vamitra dis-satisfied with the insistence of his disciple Galava, asked the latter to procure 800 grey horses with black ears as his tuition fee. Galava too, like Utanka, was going to lay down his life, when, by a stroke of fortune, he came across the ing of birds, Garuda. The latter carried him on the top of Mount Rsabha, where they met Sandili, who offered him food. Due to the reasons described in the Sanskrit text, Garuda now became a pitiable shabby bird, and he craved the pardon of Sandili.
The latter said, " Na bhetavyam - Suparna'si Suparne tyaja sambhramam".

Regarding the Old-Javanese prose; translation of the Sanskrit Udyogaparvan, Dr. Van der Tuuk* has observed that this is the ""most corrupted of all"' the parvas and the difficulty has been increased by the infiltration of many unintelligible passages. Dr. Juynboll, who has done more work than any other single scholar in this branch of study, has drawn up a somewhat comprehensive list of Sanskrit Sslokas occurring in the Old-Javanese Udyogaparva and has compared it with that of the Calcutta-recension. - We select a few specimen slokas

Jav. annotation : "The fire is derived from water. The Ksatriyas likewise owe their origin to the Brahmanas, and iron to the stone. The power of them all, though not different, becomes impotent against the original source."" The �lokas we have quoted from the Sanskrit and the Old-Javanese recensions of the Mahabharata will demonstrate

the kinship that subsists between these works, particularly

� l # $ , 4

between the Calcutta edition and the Javanese recension.
The question, therefore, naturally arises, when this Indian recension of the Sanskrit Udyogaparvan made its way into Java > Though the materials at our disposal are not sufficient to answer the question, we can still hazard the opinion that it travelled to Java after the Hindu revival in the island in the 9th century of the Christian era, and before the beginning of the llth century A. D., when the Javanese work was composed. The Javanese recension contains 197 adhyayas.

With this brief survey of the Indo-Javanese Udyogaparva,

we now pass on to consider the Bhismaparva, the next important book of the Mahabharata.

The Bhismaparva is comparatively a small work, and it offers a description of the earlier portions of the KuruPandava war. The Mahabharata-story really begins with the hitting of the target, and ends, as Winternitz� tells us, with laments over the fall of Duryodhana, with a few words about subsequent events. So the main interest of the story grows in volume from the beginning of the war, which falls in the Bhismaparva, though a tense apprehension of the coming war has enveloped the atmosphere of the Indo-Javanese Udyogaparvas. The book does not enjoy much popularity in Java and Bali as the Adiparva and the Virataparva. And this, we believe, has to be accounted for by the fact that the existence of the Kawi-work called Bharatayuddha has minimised the importance of the Bhismaparva to a great extent. The former gives a graphic description of the war with great

force and vividness, *+ and this has served to overshadow the latter book in the eyes of the people. This book, it should be noted, also contains some Sanskrit �lokas. The following couplet, which occurs in Cod. 4139, tallies with a similar passage in the Calcutta recension of the Sanskrit

Mahabharata :''Katham yuyudhire virah Kurupandavasomakah Parthivah sumahatmano nanadegasamagatah ""

One peculiarity of these parvas is the frequency of Sanskrit verses, which have been interspersed here and there. They come in, as Kern has observed, where a new chapter begins, or where an important speech has to be set on the lips of an important person. - But these verses are

by no means complete, and we sometimes get only one-half or one-fourth of a �Sloka. Even then, some words have been unrecognisably spoilt, probably by later Eopyists, who did not understand the sacred tongue of India. There has also occurred the intrusion of non-Sanskritic terms, some of which are problems to linguists as a peculiar hodge-podge.
The prose texts in Old-Javanese, which occur in these works, though written in what Kern says, "een - half kinderlijken half katechetischen stil" and '"'in't meest prozaische proza,"" are still of immense value to us in as much as they are trustworthy documents of Old.
Javanese language and literature towards the closing decade of the 10th century A. D. and the beginning of the eleventh.
With these observations on the earlier part of the IndoJavanese Mahabharata, we now pass on to consider the Bharatayuddha, the most significant work of the Midtwelfth century.

II. The Bharatayuddha The Bharatayuddha has been described by Friederich

as the Iliad of the Javanese peoples and the author of it,

Mpu Sedah, has been described as the Homer of Indonesia.
The author" says of himself :"Nowan don Puseda makirtia Sasakala risang a

kuda Sudda Candrama-"

i. e. the year 1079 (Saka)? was made annus mirabilis by the contribution of Puseda.
The date is also confirmed by other writers as well. The

* Wawatekan, which we have described before, gives the same date in the very same terms of Candrasankala. According to Dr. Juynboll, the work has been written in simple and luminous style, and its classical handling reminds one of the heroic poems of Greece. The opinion of Dr. Hazeu,* ''Niet de dichter dus, veeler de hier aan het woord" -seems to be unjust in as much as the poet has shown traces of real genius here and there. The poet had a keen power of observation like Wordsworth, but he had none of his philosophical insight.

, f? He has observed how the �(?�ampak flowers were in full

" bloom and were ready to fall," "faded tafjung flowers were caught in spiders web," and how the "dead shells were deposited on the banks by retiring waters." He has not even missed to notice the "marks that have been left upon the rocks by the current of the stream." of comparison and description seem to be equally great, though he has introduced the artificialities of style which we notice in Magha, and some other classical writers of ancient India. Considering the question from all points of view, we can probably accept him as a good poet with some powers of imagination, and with keen powers of observation.

The poet was tutor to the king of Kediri, Sri Paduka Bhatara Jayabhaya, in whose reign the poem was composed.
It has been stated that the author fell into disgrace and the latter portions of his work were completed by Mpu Panuluh, a- Buddhist author of high literary gifts. Some parts of this account are corroborated by the Old-Javanese Harivamia. We shall now give a brief account of the contents of the Bharatayuddha, which may be stated in the following manner :The work opens with a prologue, which discusses the conversation between Bhatara Girinatha and Jayabhaya, and describes the time when the work was undertaken by Mpu Sedah. The main theme of the story begins with the 8th strophe. It states how Krsna was sent by the eldest of the Pandavas to Suyodhana to demand "a division of '* It should be noted, however, that in the Old-Javanese Udyogaparva, Yudhisthira demanded the cities of Avisthala, Vrkasthala, Varanavata, Makandi and Avasana.
Thus Krsna, followed by Satyaki, left Virata for the Kuru-capital. The author then gives a graphic description of the surrounding landscape in which he not only notices the tafijung-plant, which, having "reclosed its petals hung like a closed umbrella,"* but also the "joints of sugarcanes," "" thus combining high imaginative expressions with the most common-place ones. On his way to Hastina, Krsna was joined at the suburbs of the capital by Kanva, Janaka and Narada, and he himself occupying the charioteer's place, drove of towards the city alongy with the three panditas. Hearing that Krsna was coming, Bhisma and Dhrtarastra passed orders to show respect to the honourable guest-to which Sakuni, Karna and Duryodhana demurred, The author then describes the reception accorded to him by all people, to which we had occasion to refer already in connexion with our study of the IndoJavanese alarik@ra. - After a short parley with Drona, Bhisma, Krpa, Vidura, Dhrtarastra and others, he touched

the country.

'"'expanded like an opening flower." After consoling her, Krsna went to Vidura again. In strophes 37-39, the Kauravas discuss the course to be pursued and it is enlivened, much to the liking of Duryodhana, by the militant notes of Krpa, Karna, Sakuni and some others.
The night draws in and wears out to midnight, when the Brahmanas proclaim the hour (str. 54). Next morning Krsna again came to the hall of audience to placs formally the demands of the Pandavas, to which the sober people nodded assent (str. 67-73). The mischievous Kauravas were now preparing to strike him below the belt, and Krsna, being informed of the whole affair, assumed his Visuumiurti, with four arms, three heads and three eyes. There arose a commotion in the elements of nature (str. 77-80), and the Kauravas were struck with fear. When Drona, Bhisma and Narada reminded Krsna of the vows of Bhima and Draupadi, the god relented and assumed his former shape. After the assembly broke up, Krsna enlightening Kunti of the state of affairs, returned from the Kuru-capital.
The chariot moved so quickly that "time could not be counted," and within a short time he reached Virata and reported the attitude of the Kauravas to the assembled Pandavas. A council of war was held immediately and, next morning, they issued forth in a stream from the capital of Virata to decide the whole question by an appeal to.
arms. - The author then gives some description of the army, and how it was marshalled in two contending camps.
The poet compares the fluttering banners to "dark clouds "' Several strophes are then devoted to the enumeration of persons, who were appointed to conduct the war. Just before the war, Arjuna and Krsna . open a conversation which is couched in the spirit that ! pervades the opening section of the Bhagavadgita. The ideas

CH. XI] THE MAHABHARATA 253

'The author then takes us through the meshes of the war with ups and downs in the tide of fortune. The fall of Bhisma is described in strophes 162-164. The poet describes how the blood of Bhisma, sprouting forth in the regions above, scatters itself in the form of flowers. Then the death of Bhagadatta, Abhimanyu, Jayadratha, Bhurigrava, Karna, Ghatotkaca and others is described with some detail.
The note-strings of the death of Salya and the aftermath -of the war have been strung in deep pathos. The inter-play of emotions in Satyavati has been brought out in a masterly fashion. The poet says how a flash of lightning guided the lady to her husband, and how she "grasped the livid corpse" For the last time, because she

9 %

in "'frantic wilderness was now prepared for committing suicide, she fully gazed upon the "beloved features"" of her husband and applied *'healing balm'"' to his wounds, as if, her husband would come back to life. The blood that was 1trickling; out from his chest, she wiped off carefully with the "skirt of her embroidered vest" and dyed his "pallid lips"" with the Siri juice. She enquired why his lips were now sealed in unmeaning silence, without a single word of comfort for her.
She now takes leave of her earthly relations, her accompanying lady-attendant, and then commits suicide with a view to be again in the presence of her departed master. Her only fear was that the celestial nymphs might get a precedence over her by stealing the love of her affectionate husband, and so she dies with the words in her lips'*T hough Vidadaris (vidyadharis) shall obey thy call,

Yet keep me a place above them all."

Indeed, how beautiful and how womanly ! She loved her husband so passionately, so intensely that she could not even dream that the affections of her husband should be partnered by unknown women! The female attendant also followed the example of her mistress and they went to heaven.

Then is described the battle between Bhima and Suyodhbana, in which the former reminded by Arjuna struck

the latter on the left thigh. Thus Suyodhana was killed.

254 THE MAHABHARATA

This is answered by the carnage of Agvatthaman at dead of night. The author ends by describing that Bhatara Jaya Bhaya is no other than Dharmmavam�@a or Yudhisthira, the king of Hastina.
� It is probable that the subject-matter of the Bharata -_- yuddha, leaving aside the native touches, was the kernel of the original Sanskrit Mahabharate, which has assumed!
its present proportions through the accretions of centuries.
A prologue and an epilogue were all that was needed togive it a well-balanced form, which, though non-existing in the Bharatayuddha, must have covered in a very brief way the early history of the two royal dynasties and their position after the Great War, where the Sanskrit story probably ended.
The Bharatayuddha was brought out in modern Javanese by Jasa di pura I and Jasa di pura II, in tembang macapat metre. The former was Sabha-pandit of Paku Buvana III

(1749-1788).* It should be observed, however, that the

New-Javanese recension is somewhat different from the Old-Javanese Bharatayuddha.

III Last Books of the Mahabharata

Of the last books of the Mahabharata, we do not possess.
the Gada, Sauptika, Stri, Santi, and the Advamedhikaparva.
The books that have escaped the ravages of time are only four in number, viz., Afgrama, Mausala, Prasthanika and the Svargarohanaparva. As the first three have been translated and edited by Dr. Juynboll," it is now possible to give an account of the contents. We shall first describe the Agramavasanaparva," as the fifteenth book of the Sanskrit Mahabharata is called in Java. lt contains at least 53 Sanskrit glokas and

CH._XJ] THE MAHABHARATA 255

the number will be considerably augmented if half-verses are also taken into consideration. The contents of the OldJavanese A�gramavasanaparva may be described in the following manner. The story opens with a query of king Janamejaya, who asked Bhagavan Vai�ampayana to give an account of Yudhisthira after his sons, the hundred Kauravas and others had been killed in the great Kuru-Pandava war.
He also wanted to be enlightened about the Pandavas and their doings. The great sage then began to narrate the postwar history. - He said that Dhrtarastra, who was upset by the consequences of the Bharatayuddha, became gradually reconciled to the Pandavas. The Pandavas, too, on their part, paid their due homage to the old man. It was only Bhima, who did not like to show any courtesy to the father of his enemies. Queen Gandhart was also reconciled in course of time. The old Dhrtarastra, who had now no charm for the world, began fasting and.prepared himself for asceticism. Having resolved to go to the forest, Dhrtarastra wished to perform a Sraddha-ceremony, for which purpose he asked Yudhisthira to give him gold, horse, elephants, etc., for distribution. - After the Sraddha-ceremony was over Gandhari, Kunti, Safijaya and others followed Dhrtarastra, who began to weep on seeing Kunti accompanying him.
Upon this Yudhisthira said to Kunti, "Mother, forgive my words: Vadhiijanabrata nari na diuram gantum arhati." Kunti also replied, padan gugrusanti vane'nuaham.'" As Kunti could not be persuaded to turn back home, the Pandavas and others returned to the capital weeping. Meanwhile, Dhrtarastra crossed many countries and came to the Ganga. He came in sight of the Kuruksetra and. passed the night there with Sataylipa, a sage of great reputation. Next day he proceeded further and was initiated by Bhagavan Vyasa. Vidura, Safijaya, Gandhari and Kunti also began to practise hard austerities. Meanwhile, Yudhisthira was very anxious for them and, after calling his brothers and other members of the royal family,.
he asked them to accompany him. The writer then Gives some details of ascetics who were performing asceticism

without food, drink, sleep and even water. Yudhisthira proceeded to where Vidura was ; but the latter died just after he had caught the last view of Yudhisthira. The king now wanted to burn him, but a heavenly voice said, "Bho bho rajan na dagdhavyam Vidurasya .' years had now elapsed after the Great War and Bhagavan Vyasa came to console the forest-dwelling royal family. He asked them to repair to the banks of the river Ganga.
Dhrtarastra, thus followed by the Pandavas, Kunti, Draupadi,

Subhadra and the widows of the 100 Kauravas, reached the banks of that holy river. There he gave presents to the

Sixteen

ascetics and the poor and took bath in the crystal water of the river. Gandhari and Dhrtarastra then received the divyacaksu, i.e., the celestial vision, and this enabled them to see the heroes of the Bhiarata-war. Vyasa then described the previous birth of these heroes. After this, the Pandavas returned to their capital along with the female members who had accompanied them. After the lapse of two years, the Divine messenger Narada came to the capital of the Pandavas and described how Dhrtarastra, Gandhari and Kunti were burnt down by forest-fire. Narada eulogised the burning of Gandhari with Dhrtarastra and, after consoling the royal family, he went away. Towards the close of this book, the writer says that at that time 36 years had passed from the end of the Kuru-Pandava war.

Then begins the Mausalaparva.* King Janamejaya asked Vaifampayana why the Brahmanas had cursed the Vrsnis and the Andhakas and how they all perished. This subject forms the frame-work of the Old-Javanese Mausalaparva.
Vaigampayana related that once Bhagavan Vi�vamitra, Kanva and Narada went to Dvaravati and they were ridiculed there by the Yadavas, foremost of whom were Sarana and Samba.
Indeed, the latter disguised himself as a woman and asked the boon of a child of the rsis. As the ascetics were endowed with prophetic vision, they came to know everything

CH,. XT] THE MAHABHARATA 257

and cursed that Simba, son of Krsna, would give birth to a musala and this would lead to the destruction of the Yadavas..
Only Krsna and Valadeva would be saved from the turmoils of the civil war, though the first would be killed by Jara and the second would vanish into the sea. In course of time, Samba bore a musala which glared like fire. This was then presented to king Ugrasena, who ordered it to be thrown into the sea. - This was, however, transformed into reeds and grass, which margined the shores of the sea. While Ugrasena and Krsna requested the Vrsnis and the Andhakas to remain | in the path of virtue, they did not pay any heed to these wise words of caution. Kali now visited the Yadavas in the guise of a man and saw how the Vrsuis and the Andhakas disgraced themselves. The author then describes how "coming events cast their shadows before." It was the thirtysixth year after the Kuru-war, when Ganh�iri had cursed Krsna. There was an eclipse and women of the Yadavas began to see horrible dreams. Soon after occurred that drinking bout which brought about the final destruction of them all.
In their quarrel, they broke of reeds and grass that stood by the sea-shore, and they were immediately turned into musalas. They were used as weapons wherewith fathers killed their sons, and the sons killed their fathers and other 'blood-relations, without distinguishing friend and foe. Krsna stood aghast and saw in his neighbourhood the dead bodies of Simba, Papyumna (Pradyumna), Carudesna and Aniruddha. He sought out Valadeva, Babhru and Daruki and the last one was requested to fetch Arjuna. - After his departure, Babhru was killed by a huntsman while he was trying to remove the women. Krsna then went to Vasudeva and reported the destruction of the Yadavas. Then leaving some instructions with him, he repaired to the Prabhasatirtha.
Ultimately he went to a forest and became absorbed in Samadhi, in which position he was accidentally killed by the hunter Jara. EKrsna then assumed the divine form of Vispu and repaired to heaven, where he was worshipped by all gods including Mahadeva.
Now, Arjuna hurriedly came to Dvaravati and viewed

17

258 THE MAHABHARATA

with dismay the horrible scenes'of destruction prevailing all around. He fell senseless to the ground, though he gradually recovered. Vasudeva died next morning. There was utter confusion everywhere. Arjuna with a heavy heart burnt the grand old man with the fallen Yadavas, and this was immediately followed by a great flood, which totally destroyed Dvaravati. Arjuna, fearing the strength of the current, fled towards the Pafijab along with the wives of Krsna. At this time, a gang of robbers fell upon them, took off all jewels of the ladies and dishonoured them. After the departure of the robbers, he came to Indraprastha. - The author then describes how the Pandavas then made Vajra, king of Indraprastha, and enjoined upon him the duties of protecting the four castes and the four aAsramas. Of the wives of Krsna, Rukmini, Jamvavati and Satyabhama committed themselves to the fire ; others repaired to cloisters. Arjuna went to the hermitage of Vyasa and requested him to narrate why the Yadavas were so destroyed. Vyasa re-told the old story and advised Arjuna to perform penances in the forest.
Yudhisthira, when informed of the affairs of Dvaravati, wept with his other brothers. The Musalaparva ends with, "Ii(h)i Mo(k)salaparwwa yathapurana."

� - Dr. Juynboll remarks� that in the Mausalaparva the description of the death of Valadeva is given too early. In the Sanskrit version of the story, the above episode occurs after Krsna repaired to the woods. More peculiar is the description of the four Pandavas who came to hell-a theme, though occurring in the Old-Javanese Prasthanikaparva, is wholly foreign to the Sanskrit text? After the Prasthanikaparva� follows the Svargarohanaparva, which opens with 'om avighnam astu. This work is bulkier than some other parvas and contains but few verses from the Sanskrit text.
The contents of the Svargarohanaparva may be described in the following manner. Yudhisthira came to heaven and was surprised to find there Duryodhana and other Kauravas,

1 Juynboll, op. cit., p. 26.
2 lbid., pp. 137-147.

CH. XT] THE MAHABHARATA 259

who were sitting there in company of the gods. Yudhisthira enquired of the four Pandavas and asked why Karna was not present among the Kauravas. Narada answered that he must forget what once happened on the earth. The Ist chapter ends with, "Iti - sambu((bha)sana-kathaparvani Prathamo' dhya(ya)." In - the Sanskrit text, this chapter has no particular name. Dr.
Juynboll says' that in other Javanese Parvas, we do not find any chapter-division such as here. Besides, he says, the conversation between Janamejaya and Vaifgampayana is more frequent here than even in the Sanskrit text.

Yudhisthira asked where his brothers and friends were and he heard with astonishment that they were in hell.
He said thereupon that he would rather live in hell with the Pandavas than with the Kauravas in heaven. The gods gave with him an escort to conduct him to heb as the way was extremely difficult. He observed all sorts of worms and peculiar animals crouching hither and thither ; the mutilated hands and feet were shooting forth nauseating smell. He must also cross a deep stream with hot water, after which one could expect to enter the hell. The hells are described by the author in vivid colour. Yudhisthira wanted to turn back from this horrible scene, when an aerial voice called him, "An(u)graheng(hat) - Dharmaputra - tistha tavakmatakam - (�vanmuhurtakam)."� This is the only Sanskrit verse which occurs in this Parva.

Yudhisthira had not heard the voice, but he found out to his utter surprise that the Pandavas and their friends were calling him to stay back. Thereupon he asked the

Devadiuta (the Ms. has Devasuta) to return to heaven. Here

ends the second chapter. Now follows a conversation between Janamejaya and in which the latter gave a glowing account of virtues accruing from the study of the Mahabharata. It appears from this that the Epic was as honoured as the Vedas and it was meant for the

1 Juynboll, op. cit., p. 24. g Ibid., p. 27.

260 THE MAHABHARATA

Brahmanas, the Saivas� and the Saugatas: Dr. Juynboll says that the last reference does not occur in the Sanskrit text. Then follows a list of the books of the Mahabharata, which differs from that given in the Old-Javanese Adiparva.
The name of the Anusgasanaparva occurs in this list. The lessons which Vaifamp@yana gave to Janamejaya include teachings in the legal theories of Manu.

Vaifampayana then related that Yudhisthira took bath in the river Ganga and left off his mortal coil. He then saw the Pandavas in heaven. Here ends the third chapter known as Yudhisthiradharmasambhasang(@sana)katha. In the Sanskrit text this is known as Yudhisthira-tanutyaga.
Dharma then ied him to Krsna, Arjuna, Bhisma and - Draupadi. He also heard from Indra that the Vrsnis and the Andhakas had also gone to heaven. Herewith ends the fourth chapter. �

Janamejaya then wanted to know more of the heroes who were killed in the titanic struggle of the Kuru-Pandava war. Vai�ampayana informed him that these subjects were more known to Suka, the son of the great sage Vyasa. And accordingly, Suka began to relate the story of the heroes who fought in the Great Bharata-war. He said that these warriors have turned into gods and demons, as they were before. So Bhisma merged himself into the eight Vasus, Pandu into Indra, Drupada into Varuna, Vasudeva into Kagyapa and Abhimanyu into Sang Hyang Wulan. The comrades of Duryodhana were transformed into raksasas.
Meanwhile, the wives of Krsna came to heaven. Ghatotkaca, who is now a popular figure in Javanese Wayang plays, was also transformed into Yaksa.

The story again veers round to Yudhisthira who obtained the unstinted praise of all gods Indra said to him that

CH. XI] THE MAHABHARATA 261

at the Bharata-war. In this portion, as Dr. Juynboll* points out, the Old-Javanese text is more elaborate than the Sanskrit version. The treacherous way in which Bhisma and Salya were done to death is also fully discussed. Indra then advised Yudhisthira to take a fresh bath in the river Ganga and by this means all his previous sins were worn of. The book closes with some topics of the previous war.
Janamejaya thanked the speaker for his narratives.

As regards the date of the last four books of the Mahabharata described above, we are quite in the dark.
No light is thrown from external sources. Linguistic evidences are also not of much value unless corroborated by other trustworthy evidences. There are some reasons to believe that the Korava�rama, Kufijarakarna - and the A gramavasanaparva were composed in W. Java in the 14th century A. D. The use of interjections, as we have said before, is a peculiarity of contemporary Sundanese literature and, therefore, the occurrence of 'Jag glis upaper' in the Asgramavasanaparva may be important from this point of view." We shall not be far wrong probably if we accept these four works as specimens of the fourteenth-century

literature.
In India, the Harmamsa is regarded as an appendix of

the Mahabharata and we cannot, therefore, find a more suitable occasion for the discussion of this work than the present one. The main theme of this kakawin may be

described in the following manner :It says that Krsna was enamoured of Rukmini. And this

brought about a quarrel between him and Jarasandha. The latter requisitioned the help of Sigupala. The subject has sometimes been handled in an original way, as we are told that Jarasandha was helped by the Pandavas, who thus fought against Krsna. As three of the Pandavas were killed in the fight, Arjuna wanted to turn the scale of the war.
Krsna also took his divine from."

2062 THE MAHABHARATA

It is interesting to note that the writer of this book, Mpu Panuluh, professed the Buddhist religion, while the choice of his subject was Hinduistic. The book was composed in the reign of king Jayabhaya, and this appears from the last verse of the second strophe which runs as follows :"Sn Digjayanjayayayapanjati Vignvatmaka." The Jayajaya of the above verse has already been restored to Jayabhaya by Dr. Van der Tuuk.�' The poet was connected with the composition of the Bharatayuddha, as we have seen before.
s�+-- The Sanskrit Harivam�a furnished immense materials for the poets and artists of Greater India. In the bas-reliefs of Angkor Vat, the artists have described the story of Pradyumna enjoying the company of the daughter of king Bana, in the latter's harem. The departure of Krsna for Sonitpura and the arrival of Garuda before the wall of fire which encircled the city-have been delineated with great vividness." The episode, which describes how Krsna was once bound by a rope and how he up-rooted two Arjuna-trees while pushing out the rope through them, is present both at Angkor Vat" as well as at the Visnu-temple of Prambianan.* There are many other episodes of this character represented in the structures of Greater India and they prove the great sway the work had over the thoughts

of the Non-Indian peoples.

CHAPTER XI

ITIHASA OR EPIC WORKS, Contd.

THE MAHABHARATA-CYCLE OF STORIES.

The Mahabharata contains more legends than the ~ Ramayana and has thus served as an inexhaustible quarry to the classical writers of Java and Bali. A large number of kakawins and Wayang stories has been based upon or inspired by the legends of the Mahabharata, which were not infrequently given the orientation of Indonesia. Sometimes, the classical writers of Java accepted the main characters of the Sanskrit Epic as the heroes of their works but we shall seek in vain for the discovery of the main outline of these stories in the labyrinth of Sanskrit literature. It is not an easy matter in such cases to guess the source of their inspiration. But there are other Kawi-works which can easily be referred to the Epic literature of Ancient India. In the present chapter we shall try to give an account of both these groups of works.

Let us begin with the popular Kawi-work called the Harivijaya, which is mainly based upon the story of the Churning of the Milk-sea in the Adiparvan. We have already seen how the legend spread throughout the greater part of South-East Asia, and how it was immortalised in the art of Cambodia. It appears that this exquisite early Indian myth made an irresistible aesthetic appeal to the cultured peoples of Java and Bali. The Harivijaya gives an elaborate account of this story. The book has been written in pure Old-Javanese and its title appears in

canto LVIII.

Bat. (ien., XXXI, pp. 114-116.

264 THE MAHABHARATA-CYCLE OF STORIES

The first canto opens with a graphic description of the sods and demons, who had flocked together near Mount Mandara. Anantabhoga, who dragged the Mount to the Milk-sea according to the Adiparvan version of the story, also plays here the same role. The tortoise Akupara, whom we notice in verse MCXXIl of the Sanskrit Adiparvan, has been transformed here into Akupa. In the second verse of the fourth canto the poet describes the emergence of the horse UccefSrava (Skt. Uccaihfgravas) from the depths of the sea. The origin of Laksmi or Sri has been related in the fourth verse of this canto, and this corresponds to sloka MCXLVI of the Sanskrit Adiparvan. In the Khmer representation of the story we actually find Laksmi emerging from the churning of the Milk-sea. The next song gives the origin of the divine physician Dhanvantari, and this agrees with sloka

MCXLIX of the Sanskrit text. As the poet says :

''Singgih siri ni �rsti ning jaladhi parvata tumuluy '

adadya Dhanvantari.

�__ The main interest of the story, however, grows from song

(XXVIII, which introduces to us the raksasa-king Ratmaija, 'a name that does not occur in the Old-Javanese Adiparva.

As this Asura-king had taken possession of Amrta, Visnu filched it away from him in the disguise of Laksmi.
In the following songs the poet gives a graphic description of the war between the gods and demons. - In verse XIV of song LXIX, we find Indra seeking the help of Visnu, who at last killed the Asura-king Bali (verse XXXI). - With canto LV begins the history of Rahu, which also occurs in the Old-Javanese ?diparva: Dr. Juynboll* draws our attention to the fact that the name of Rahu's father, which is Vipracitti in the Sanskrit version, has been corrupted to Vipracinti both here and in the OldJavanese Adiparva.

The kakawin Rainavijaya has also been written in a.
luminous style, though the author has taken some liberties.

with the spelling of Sanskrit names. For example, the heroine of the poem, viz., Tilottama, has appeared here as Lottama. The subject of this poem'* has been borrowed from the Old-Javanese Adiparva, which owes its origin to India. The main interest of the poem veers round Lottama or Tilottama, the celestial courtesan, who was the prize of a duel between Sunda and Upasunda, both of whom wanted to possess the lovely maiden. About her, Somadeva� writes in his Kathasaritsagara: - "And Brahma, wishing to destroy them (Sunda and Upasunda) gave an order to Vi�vakarman and had constructed a heavenly woman, in order to behold whose beauty even Siva truly became four-faced*" so as to look four ways at once while she was devoutly circumbulating him"". So a duel ensued over this Tilottama and the two monsters, exhausted with their deadly strife, breathed their last. Thus the fruits of their asqgeticism, which had made Indra apprehensive of their ultimate design, were spoilt in the allurements of the celestial courtesan.

The title of the book appears in verse V of canto XXII.
Some figures of the Mahabharata also play a prominent in the work called (Ghatotkaca�raya, of which the title is given in canto LI. It seems that this kakawin, like the Nagarakrtagama, was also known by a second name. In the first verse of canto L, for example, we find''Sampu keketan ing kathatita Ghatotkacagarana ngaranya tanparacana.""

At any rate, the meanings of these two titles, Ghatotkacasraya and Ghatotkacagarana are identical.

The work is important from two points of view. It has been written in pure Old-Javanese and has served as an important source of Malay and Javanese Wayang stories.

206 THE MAHABHARATA-CYCLE QOF STORIES

Indeed, the panakawan's,* who are well-known figures in the Wayang-literature, are probably noticed for the first time in the Ghatotkaca�raya."* The kernel of the story? is formed by the description of a fight between Abhimanyu and Laksmanakumara over the possession of a lovely maiden Ksitisundari by name. Ghatotkaca, the celebrated hero of the Kuru-Pandava war, came to help his cousin for turning the scales of the war.

It is not an easy matter to find out the date of this Kawiwork. In the first verse of canto L, the name of the author appears as Mpu Panuluh. The question naturally arises, is he identical with the author of the Harivam�a ? And if so, how are we to account for the following verse occurring in the third strophe of canto I, viz.,'"Sri bhupala Jayakrta prabhu vifesa tuhutuhu bhatara h

It seems to show that the author flourished in the reign of king Jayakrta. Panuluh, the writer of the describes Jayabhaya as the reigning king. If we seek to identify the two Panuluhs, we shall have to prove that this Jayakrta, under whose reign the Ghatotkacasraya was composed, is a predecessor or a follower of Jayabhaya, king of Kediri. We do not know of any Jayakrta reigning in Kediri before the time of Jayabhaya. After him we find a king of the name of Sri Janarddhanavatara Vijayagraja Samasinghanadanivaryyaviryya Parakrama Digjayottungadeva. A record from Kediri, dated 1160 A.D., stands against his name." Besides, there is a tradition that

the son of Jayabhaya was Jayakatwang,* who is still a shadowy figure. Though we know from an anonymous work* the name of one Jayanagara Katwang ing Jagat, who seems to be a patron of literature, there is no plausible ground for identifying these two persons. Thus there is no room for Jayakrta just after the reign of Jayabhaya at least in the present state of our knowledge.

Long afterwards, we come across one or two kings

bearing the name of Krtajaya.} An inscription of Krtajaya I

bears the date 1190 A. D. If he be distinguished from Krtajaya II, the date of the latter must fall after 1222 A. D. Is it possible then that the present case is similar to that of the Sumanasantaka ? If Krtajaya be the same person as Jayakrta, Panuluh can be placed in the reign of one of them.
In that case it will not be proper for us to identify the author of the Harivam�a with that of the (Ghatotkaca�raya.
Provisionally we shall regard Mpu Panuluh, the writer of the Ghatotkacasraya as a different person, who flourished c. 1200 A. D. The supposition of two poets of the same name flourishing within 50 years need not be taken as a serious objection, because examples can be adduced from 'the history of Indian literature to prove the contemporaneity of different writers of identical names.

We shall now describe another important Kawi-work, viz., the Arjunavivaha.* It runs into 36 cantos, and the main ~ outline of the poem may be described in the following

manner. - The first sarga opens with an account of the demon-king, Nivatakavaca, who was a constant source. of fear to Indra and other gods of heaven. His fortress stood on the Southern foot of the Mount Meru, and was known as Manimantaka.* He could not be defeated by gods,

from the Highest God.

The attention of gods was, therefore, naturally directed

This was the boon he received

to the mortal hero Arjuna, who was undergoing austere penances on the Indrakila hill. To test the mettle of Arjuna and to see if he was equal to the task, Indra decided to send him a bevy of divine courtesans, of whom Tilottam& and Suprabh&@a were the foremost. The seven nymphs, after making Sembah, i.e., salutation to the king of gods, flew through the air and reached the Indrakila hill by the morning. The poet then offers a description of the surrounding landscape.

The second canto continues the description of the natural scenery and gives an account of the toilette made by the nymphs to meet Arjuna. The next sarga opens with the description of Arjuna and his penances. The poet relates in canto IV how the nymphs tried to beguile him for three nights and how they returned to heaven after their fruitless endeavour. All the gods were overjoyed at the report of the celestial nymphs ; because they now discovered in him the true saviour of all inmates of heaven.
When Arjuna had stood the test of the above ordeal, Indra decided to examine the depth of his philosophical acumen and we find him appearing in canto V before Arjuna in the disguise of an old ascetic. The conversation of these two ascetics is fully described in the following sarga. In strophe VI of this song, Indra assumes his own appea~ rance and is honoured by the ascetic prince. The seventh canto opens with the invasion of the demons, who were temporarily pacified, as the poet says, by sama and dana.
~ The demons suspected this to be a trick of the gods to.

gain a breathing space and they accordingly sent spies throughout the length and breadth of the three worlds.
A deaf spy brought information that Partha was making penances on the Indrakila hill and he was sought by the gods. Nivatakavaca thereupon sent Si-Murkha to kill him and the giant, assuming the form of a boar, began to shatter the hill-sides. Arjuna, disturbed in his penances, took his bow and shot an arrow, which brought about the death of the giant. Now that Partha's Yoga was reaching fruition, Nilakantha appeared in the disguise of a Kirata or hunter. In canto VIII we find the two quarrelling, for the hunter had also discharged an arrow and had abused the teacher of Arjuna. Arjuna, however, desired to forgive '\him if he took back his word and paid him due homage.
As the hunter would do neither, the fight began between the two and this is described through tlre following canto.
Towards the close of this sarga, the poet presents Kirata in his form seated on a padmasanamani.
The prayers of Arjuna are then described up to the end �of sarga XI. In the first strophe of canto XII, we find Siva giving him the powerful pagupati-weapon. He also left some instructions with Arjuna on the Science of War.
As Partha was now home-sick, he was thinking of returning 'to his brothers and relatives, when a letter came from India.
Accompanied by the two Apsarasas, Airavana and Vajran, Arjuna proceeded towards heaven. - The poet describes in canto XIV how the gods of heaven became gladdened like plants and ivy creepers, which dance in glee on the approach of rains in the month of Kapak. Arjuna paid his homage to the king of gods, who was conferring with Brhaspati about statecraft. In the sixteenth strophe we find Indra suggesting to Arjuna that he should unravel the .
mystery that hangs over the power of Nivatakavaca. For this purpose Indra asked him to go to Manimantaka along with Suprabha. After passing through many countries*, the natural scenery of which the poet describes

1 Canto XV.

270 THE MAHABHARATA_CYCLE OF STORIES

with some picturesqueness, we find the two alighting on Manimantaka. The sixteenth canto describes the preparations of demons for invading heaven. The poet describes here a lively conversation between Suprava and Arjuna, who were now in deep love. In the following sarga, Suprabha announced herself, and she was introduced to Nivatakavaca, who had tried in vain to secure her from the king of gods (canto XVIII). While flirting with the king of demons, she learnt with much satisfaction that the magic of his strength lay on the point of his tongue. Now that the object of her mission was fulfilled, she vanished from Manimantaka. - The poet describes this episode in the nineteenth canto. The following sarga opens with a commotion in the citadel of the demon-king and we find.
him marshalling his soldiers for the destruction of heaven.
In canto XXI, the poet describes how Krudhaksa, Duskrta, Virakta and Karalavaktra, his trusted ministers, all hailing from the family of Hiranyakagipu and Kalakeya, made preparations for the coming war. In the fifth strophe of this canto, the name of Kamandaka appears as one versed in statecraft, - Meanwhile, preparations were also set on: foot in heaven and, among the prominent heroes, we come across the names of Indra, Citrangada, Citrasena, Jayanta,* Arjuna and others (canto XXIII). In the following sarga, we find a gigantic clash between the two armies meeting in a flat space between two ravines on the "King of Mountains." The vicissitudes of the war are described in the next two cantos (XXV?XXVI) The poet narrates

that on one occasion while Arjuna feigned reeling down in his chariot after catching a missile hurled at him, the demon-king came to attack him. - Immediatly an arrow

whizzed into his mouth and he was killed (canto XXVII).

The poet describes the jubillation in heaven in the following sarga. Arjuna then retired to the Nandana-forest"* and assumed the sovereignty of heaven for seven

days.* He was consecrated with the water of a hundred.
bathing places which were mixed up in seven diamond vases. The following five sargas describe somewhat freely the amours of Partha with Menaka, Suprabha, Tilottama and others. In the last canto we find Arjuna taking leave of Indra, who ordered Matali to conduct him in his celestial car to his brothers in the cloister of Vadari, which Arjuna reached in due time. The main theme is also referred to in the Old-Javanese Agastyaparva.*�

This is, in short, the main story of the Arjunavivaha. " Dr. Brandes� has remarked that this work betrays some Buddhistic influences. This is not, however, unadulterated.
Buddhism, but rather a curious mixture of Buddhist and.
Brahmanical Tantrism. - In the third canto, for example, we find Arjuna absorbed in deep meditation ; he sat crosslegged, his hands rested on his breast, and his eyes were fixed on the point of his nose. As the poet says,* he was lost in the 'void', he heard /

272 THE MAHABHATA-CYCLE OF STORIES

major episodes of the Arjunavivdha, e.g., the asceticism of Arjuna and his fight with Siva who appeared in the disguise of a hunter have been borrowed from the Mahabharata. The idea of introducing nymphs to beguile Arjuna was borrowed from other parts of the Mahabharata and these forms were fused together in the Arjunavivaha kakawin. In the arrangement of episodes, the writer of this work makes some departure from his original.
According to R. ng. Dr. Poerbatjaraka,* this has to be attributed to his originality and not his lack of knowledge in Sanskrit. The work contains some later interpolations and, in the Balinese recension of this work, some liberty has been taken with the spelling of proper names. The work has some kidung and New-Javanese recensions."

In the last strophe of the last sarga the poet says of him. self: �

''Finished is the description of the story, which bears the name of Arjunaviva@ha. This is really the first time that Mpu Kanva writes a poem and places it before the public. He is yet uneasy of mind, because he has to accompany the king in his wars. He pays his homage to ( His Majesty Airlangga, who has doubled his kingdom and � has graciously accepted this work." f

Thus ends the work of the Javanese Bharavi, who i composed his work towards the beginning of the 11th f century A. D. It is the first poem of Java, which can be f dated with some certainty. In the third terrace of the / Candi Jago, which is variously 'known as Candi Tumpang : and Jajagu, we find representations from the Arjunavivaha. P

The theme of the Arjunavivaha has been spun further ; in the Middle-Javanese Wangbang written in i 1 Ibid. i?

Macapat metre. In some respects, it agrees With the accounts of the Kuntiyajaia.* The former states that Kunti, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva were very anxious over the long absence of Arjuna and accordingly, Bhima was sent to search for him on the Indrakila hill.
As he returned without Arjuna, Kunti prepared to commit herself to the flames along with her sons. At this juncture, arrived Narada with the joyful news that Arjuna was married in heaven with the celestial nymph Suprabha. At last Arjuna alighted on the earth, but he had to settle accounts with the raksasa Purbaka of Karang Gumantung, whose fury was fanned by the death of Nivatakavaca. - After killing this demon, Arjuna assumed the name of Wangbang Astuti and repaired to a place called Vanasaba. Its princess Srigati was sought in marriage by the daitya-chief Madhusudana ( Madhusudana ). After a duel between the two, the laurel was own by Wangbang Astuti, who married 'the princess. But as fate would have it, the hero died sometime later on and his corpse dropped in the pleasuregarden of Anantabhoga, the king of dragons. The latter had 'the goodness to revive him and get him married with his threes daughters,. Krsna then sent his cakra or wheel to

bring Arjuna back from the Nether-world. After the death of Madhusudana, the Pandavas went to find out a white 'kidang to offer it as a sacrifice to their departed father. On 'their way, they met a raksgasa, Kala Bhuvana by name, who, killed by Bhima, appeared in the form of Visnu. The latter informed them that Jagatkarana was in possession of the white kidang. As its owner would not yield the kidang, a fight ensued between Arjuna and Jagatkarana, in which both were killed. The Vidyadharis now appear on the scene to revive the fallen heroes and it comes to light 'that Jagatkarana is the son of Arjuna by Suprabha and the lieutenants of the third Pandava are no other than the

issue of the three naga-daughters. The poem ends in a scene of reconciliation. '

~The story, as told here, is wholly foreign to Sanskrit literature. Though names and particular episodes can be traced to India, the main outline of the story has been manufactured by the author himself. Arjuna appears here in the lime-light and the powerful deities of heaven have been described, as if they were his sons.

The temple of Candi Jago* also depicts the story of the Parthayajfia. P. V. van Stein Callenfels� has sought

to identify the reliefs with the help of this kawiwork. It runs into 44 cantos and the first one opens with an invocation to the Highest God. The poet also invokes the god of Love. The second song introduces us to the main theme of the book, which illustrates a moral aphorism, viz., how men become unhappy by playing dice. Yudhisthira, for - example, possessed everything, but he lost his whole kingdom to the Kauravas who played the game fraudulently. Kunti was upset by the upshot of the play, while the princess Draupadi was stripped of her last raiment by Sakuni, who, in the presence of many men, pulled her by the hair. Draupadi promised at that time that her dishevelled hair would be knotted only when it was drenchediin the blood of Duryodhana. Bhima, highly insulted, promised to break the thigh of Duryodhana in fight. In this manner, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, though cousins, never more lived in peace and amity.
Yudhisthira, in consequence, prepared to go to the forest and remain there for twelve years. The next three cantos (III-V) describe how the Pandavas thenceforth became ready for the unavoidable war. In the sixth canto we find Arjuna preparing to perform hard austerities. It was mid1 In it Rangavuni, i.e., king Visnuvardhana (1250-1272 A.D.) was entombed. It dates, therefore, from the middle of the 18th century.

night and the third Pandava must depart in the following morning. At that moment Vidura came to them, and shortly afterwards rsi Domya (Dhaumya) announced his arrival. As Yudhisthira broke his sorrows to them, the sage consoled him by saying (canto VII) that the Pandavas being virtuous must get the better of their enemies. His long lectures are continued through the following sarga, in which the sage advised Arjuna to please the Highest God with his austerities. Yudhisthira offered his thanks to the holy sage, who left instructions with Arjuna, asking him to follow the course to the Indrakila hill, where he would find the rsi Dvaipayana. Morning broke in unclouded splendour and Arjuna, after receiving the blessings of his mother and the loving farewell of Draupadi, proceeded on his � journey (canto IX). All wept over the departure of Arjuna, who set out with his weapons to perform renances (canto X).
The poet then offers a description of the surrounding landscape and of the women who remained behind. A whole canto-the twelfth-has been devoted to the description of the fields, hills, ravines, trees and plants, which Arjuna had to pass. The theme is continued in the following song, which describes cottages ornamented with scenes from the Ramayana, and the 'flowers of those cottages -those lovely women who formerly graced the kratons with their very presence. In the fourteenth canto we find these maidens enquiring about the destination of Arjuna and the latter replying to them with proper courtesy. He came to learn that the place was called Vanavati and the name of the hermit, who lived there, was Mahayani.'* A lady who fell in love with Arjuna at first sight concealed herself behind the pillars.
The young ascetic, accompanied by the bevy of girls, went to Mahayani who greeted him in warm terms. After Arjuna had received fruits and sirih, he was questioned about the aims he had in view. The following two cantos (XV-XVl), describe the conversation of the two hermits.

The lady who in the preceding canto had concealed herself behind the columns and was known as Gula-Wuluh stole out under cover of darkness to meet the sleepless Arjuna, who was thinking of his past and future. He stood above all temptations (canto XVIII). The lady turned back weeping after making a sembah to the third Pandava (canto XIX). Arjuna, after taking directions from the Vanavati hermit, proceeded again on his journey. He saw many domestic animals and a sea, whose shore was belted by plants and trees (canto XX). The description of waterfalls and ravines continues in the following song.
We are told how sleets shot like arrows and rain poured down in torrents ; Arjuna, holding a sent�-leaf overhead as an umbrella, began to move on. It rained still harder and the whole atmosphere was surcharged with heavy clouds. The scene continues in canto XXI when we find Arjuna resting under a Waringin tree.
It was cold and dark, sulphurous stones ran against each other with tremendous velocity and fire flashed from them. The weather, however, soon changed and light flooded the scene. The poet finds another opportunity to describe the landscape just after it was purified by the torrents of rain.

. We are then introduced to canto XXIII. Evening drew in and a "'darkness invisible", to quote a phrase of Milton, wrapped the world. When the Moon shot forth its silver rays, the outline of the dark hills became more distinct.
With trees and a clear heaven behind, they appeared like Wayang-figures on the canvas. The poet then describes the beauty of the wood now bathed in Moon-shine. The monotonous description of night-animals and the wood proceeds (canto XXIV). The poet compares a great Randu tree swaying in the wind with a dancing giant. In canto XXV, the poet describes a lively conversation between Arjuna and Sri, the goddess of the kraton. The latter informed Arjuna that she had left the palace for the sins of the Kauravas. She promised, however, to return when the penances of Arjuna would obtain fruition. She asked him

CH. XII] THE MAHABHARATA-CYCLE OF STORIES - 277

to receive astraraja (lit. 'chief of weapons') from god Kirata.
Her advice continues through the following canto where she asked Arjuna to be careful, because, Duryodhana had engaged spies after him. Arjuna proceeded again with the dawn. .

The poet opens the twenty-eighth canto with a description of the sea. Arjuna saw Kama and Rati from a distance and he hid himself behind a great tree. The following canto narrates the love-affairs of these celestial beings. The thirtieth sarga again opens with a description of the sea. Arjuna thought that his objects could not be obtained if he had no interview with the god of Love.
And accordingly, he related to the deity that he was going: to perform austerities. Asked if he would enjoy the beauty of Nature, Arjuna replied that his primary duty was to carry: out faithfully the injunctions of his elder and obtain a boon from the Great God on the Himalayas. Thus he wanted to retrieve the fallen fortunes of the Pandavas. In the following canto we find Kama sympathising with the aims of Arjuna, whom he asked to take lessons in Sivagama from Sri Dvaipayana. He said that the cloister of the rsi stood on the North-eastern side of the Indrakila hill, which would be found in the Eastern region. After cautioning Arjuna against Nalamala, who originated from the tongue of the goddess Durga, the deities vanished (cantos XXXII-XXXIII).
The thirty-third song describes the form of the demon, who had three heads, the right one resembling that of a Garuda, the left one that of an elephant and the middle one that of an angry lion. After the disappearance of Kama and Rati, Arjuna found there little songs of nymphs inscribed on Pudak flowers. Nalamala came at the head of a piSacaarmy and challenged Arjuna. Their fight forms the kernel of three songs (XXXIV-XXXVI). As Arjuna fell into Samidhi, the giant turned back with a promise to wreck vengeance on the Pandavas (canto XXXVI). Ths following

song gives a description of the wood. Arjuna found a river, where he took his bath. He sat under a tree and began to weep for his mother, brother and others. In canto XXXVIII we find Arjuna thoroughly spent up with thirst and hunger.
He refreshed himself with some fruits and his journey began afresh. The meeting of Arjuna and Sri Dvaipayana is described in sarga XXXIX. The holy sage, who lived in Ingitamrtapada, was glad to see Arjuna and enquired about the goal he had in view. Arjuna related the past history and the advice of Vidura and Domya. The advice of the

holy sage runs from the fortieth to the forty-third canto. He said that the Kauravas were descended from evil demons and they must be worsted in course of the war. In sarga XLII, the sage enunciated that the highest goal was to be obtained through Negativism, and he directed Arjuna} to go to the Indrakila hill and propitiate the Great God by changing his vrata every month. The last canto describes Arjuna's reaching the hill and his penance for one long year. The God then appeared in the disguise of a kirata and, after giving the celestial weapon, vanished in his proper form.
The book betrays clear traces of Tantric Saivism. It is mainly based upon the Mahabharata, but there are episodes in the book which are unmistakably of pure Javanese origin.
The girl who fell in love with Arjuna at the hermitage of Mahayani cannot be discovered in the range of Sanskrit Literature. Arjuna's character has been degraded in comparison with the Sanskrit Mahabharata. Though these features may be attributed to the originality of the OldJavanese author, the main story has been inspired, like the previous one, by the Great Epic of India. The poet's description of natural scenery sometimes reminds us of the writings of Bhavabhiti, but this has occupied an undue space in the work under review.

�describing the marriage of Arjuna and Sumbadra ( Subhadra). He says that it was composed by Mpu during the reign of Jayabhaya* of Kediri. The work we have described above is probably mentioned in the MiddleJavanese Pararaton. As the subject has been depicted 'on the temple of Candi Jago, we provisionally accept 1250 A. D. as the date of this work. The possible margin of �error may not exceed a hundred years on both sides.

The Indravijaya kakawin," which we propose to discuss now, has been borrowed from the Udyogaparvan of the Mahabharata. In the Sanskrit text, the story, also known by this name, is told in verses CCXXVIII-DLXV. The kawiwork opens with an account of the Suravadhis, i. e., nymphs, who were despatched by Indra to spoil the penances of the austere penitent, Trigdirah, the son of Tvastar. The god was thrice baffled in his attempt and at last he ordered Vi�vakarman to strike him below the belt. In the Old-Javanese Mahabharata," the name of Taksa appears in place of the divine architect. After the assassination of Trigirah, his father created Vrtra and ordered him to kill Indra, who now sought refuse with Visnu.
The demon was ultimately killed in a treacherous way.
For this sin, Indra had to leave heaven, where the celestial throne fell vacant. At length, Nahusa was persuaded to rule over heaven. Now this up-start divine mortal, no longer satisfied with the sceptre of heaven, wanted to possess Sagi, the wife of Indra. The panicky queen fled to Brhaspati, who refused to yield her to the new sovereign of heaven.

Matters turned out exactly as Indra foresaw. The curse of Agastya turned him out of heaven and Indra again became the ruler.

The Kidung Bhimasvarga* is a curious combination of episodes taken from the Adi and the Prasthanikaparva of the: Old-Javanese Mahabharata. The work is very popular in the island of Bali. It has also a prose-recension in Malay?
and, according to Dr. Juynboll, Cod. 4132 of this work has been, written in mixed Javanese and Balinese languages.
The contents. of this book may be described in the following manner. - The poem opens with�Begawan Kidgma mangke muwah - ameng-amengan maring wandntara, sira ngelor, tandwa katmu punang kenas istri listw ayu rupane-*

which the death of Pandu has been described here agrees in all essential points with relevant portions of the Adiparva, which may, therefore, be the source. Pandu's widow Kunti spurred her five sons to fetch their father from hell or kawah.
Bhima carried his mother and brothers ; the clowns Delem, Tuwalen and Sangut, who are Balinese prototypes of the Javanese Semar and his two sons, accompanied them.

Bhima fought with Cikarabala,* Gora Vikrama, Utpata, Jogor Manik, Suratma, Dorakalas and the hell-dog Asu gaplong. At last, Bhima was able to rescue the soul. of Pandu from hell.

The second canto begins with the story of Yang Pramesti, who extended invitation to the Pandavas to come to heaven. They were thereupon killed by the gods. Arjuna, for example, was killed by Visnu, Nakula and Sahadeva by Mahasno (read, Dr. Juynboll� thinks that this portion of the Bhimasvarga has been borrowed from the Prasthanikaparva, particularly from the corrupt portions of that work. On the other hand, some passages from the: first canto of the Bhimasvarga have been interpolated in some Mss. of the Old-Javanese Prasthanikaparva.}> The third: sarga describes how DharmmavamiSa entered the regions of hell and how he was ultimately rescued by his younger.

'or they owed their origin to some exotic conceptions of the Spirit world.

The Korava�rama�* is a prose-work, which draws its main inspiration from the latter portions of the Mahabharata. It opens with the glorification of Bhagavan Vyasa, who related the Svarasatipurana. It describes how Drtarastra was �deeply mortified with the death of the hundred Kauravas.
Vyasa*,therefore, went to the field of battle with his disciples, viz., Sumantu, Pelava, Jemili and Wwesampayana. There they met Bhagavan Narada, who had received orders from Bhagavan Brhaspati to re-animate the Koravas. The group viewed the corpse of Bhisma, Drona, Salya, Duryodhana, Karna, Sakuni, Jayadratha, Bhagadata and Du�sasana. To revive them, tirtha kamandalu was sprinkled over their mangled bodies. The gods, to whom they respectively owed their origin, appeared at the time of their re-animation.
The revival of the whole army was due to the besprinkling of the firtha amprttha. On hearing a celestial voice, Bhisma advised the Koravas to take to asceticism for wrecking vengeance 'on the Pandavas. They therefore proceeded to Indragiri, where they came across Bhagavan Vi�vakarma, 'who was cutting wood for the audience-hall of Bhatara 'Caturbhuja. _ Meanwhile, Bhagavan Vyasa, asking the Pandavas to . instruct Dhrtarastra, retired with his four disciples to perform austerities. Dhrtarastra and Gandari were highly honoured by the Pandavas, though Bhima demurred in showing respects to them. Dhrtarastra, however, took instructions from Dharmmavam�$Sa or Yudhisthira, his nephew, who stated that his knowledge was derived from Visnu, Brahma, Mahadeva, Dharmmaraja and others. Dhrtarastra wanted to be enlightened about the philosophy of Tripurusa and the three numbers and

desired a solution of the mysteries of the world. After that, he asked about the causes of flood and the origin of Mah@ameru-the mountain that was so much honoured by gods and men. - Dbharmmavamia stated that the Mahameru was the Manik Astagina, in its source was to be found

- amrta and it rested on the Kurmaraja. It was also maintained by Nantaboga, whose body was inlaid. with gold and the upper part was decked with jewels. Dharmmavam�a described how this Mahameru or Sampora was brought over to Java. The author then narrates how murder originated with the assassination of Arjunarsabahu and Bhagavan Bhrgu. Dhrtarastra wanted to be enlightened about the systems of asceticism and his nephew offered instructions on yoga and the various dasanas. Astaga, Dana and Yajfia were also succinctly summed up with the remark that the last included devayajfe, rsi,� - bhuta', manusa�, pitr', a�vaveda' and the i�vajit'. - Dhrtarastra then asked why the heads of Brahmi have been described as four by some and five by others. Dharmmavam$Sa answered that he had originally five heads but later on they shrank into four. Dhrtarastra asked again why Brahma was called Caturmukha, though he had really five heads.
The author proceeds to narrate the story of Huma (Uma), 'who, on being embraced by a cow-herd, was transformed into Durga.

After the period of coaching was over, Dhrtarastra and Devi Gandari wanted to set out for Satasmriga. Led by Krpa, they came to Bhagavan Ramapara�u and his pupil Katravan. There they were entertained with food procured from Menakagiri. - After relating to his intention to emulate the example of Pandu, Dhrtarastra distributed his ornaments among the rsgis and, putting on bark, took shelter in the. tiger-hole of the Satasthga.

Meanwhile, Devavrata and the Koravas came to Mahendragiri. After being entertained by Ramaparasu, 'they enquired about the best places for performing penances and sought instruction on dharma. - Bhisma, Drona and

and repaired to Gandamadana. Among other heroes of the' Bharata war, Driyodana, Sakuni, Karna, Dursasana and Bhagadato took instructions from Ramaparasiu, who described how Indra was compelled to take the help of Visnu against some demons, viz., Mali, Hemali and Sumali.
Visnu killed the first two with his cakra or wheel, but the.
last fled to Bharuna. The author then propounds the view that gods became beautiful by catching a reflex from the beaming forms of Visnu and Sri. Bhatara Guru became envious of the beauty of Sri and assumed the form of Kala.
thereupon fled to the earth �and sought shelter with merchants. Duryodhana then asked about the best place: for conducting tapas ; for Bhatara Brahma had asked him to wreck vengeance on the Pandavas. Karna also wanted to be enlightened about the hongkaras. In reply Ramapara�u referred to the pafica, sapta and astakahangkara-mantra.
After putting some more questions as to why men honour animals, the number of islands and the depth of the sea Karna, Duryodhana, Bhagadata, Sakuni and Dursana went to perform tapas. At last Brahma appeared and Duryodhana asked the boon of killing the Pandavas.
Brahma replied that they could not be killed. But they: would be humbled by the candalas. Dufsasana also received the same answer from Siva, who appeared with: three eyes and four arms. Asked about the different lokas, Aditya, who came later on, replied that they were the Janaloka, Narakaloka, Dabyaloka, Bhuhloka, Sagvargaloka,.
Vispuloka and Sunyaloka. Among the Netherworlds,.
Aditya referred to Rasatala, Mabhitala and Siitala.

It will appear from the above review that the work is: a hybrid composition consisting of different elements. - It.
draws some materials from the Epics and the cosmogonical sections of Old-Javanese literature. The Adipurdna and.
the Tantu Panggelaran furnish the episodes of firtha kamandalu and amrfa, which find place in this work. The heroes of the Kuru-Pandava war, however, have been portrayed here in an original light. - Similarly, the beauty of Sri, of which we hear so much, not only enchanted Rahvana,

of the Serat Kanda but also some figures of the Manik Maya. The story of the Harigraya has also been suggested here, though some of the names have been corrupted. The problems regarding the number of heads of Brahma are discussed in the pages of this work as well as in the Tantu Panggelaran. Some new gods also appear in this work.
The book further furnishes a list of the parvans of the Mahabharata, but it serves no useful purpose, because in the list we not only find the name of the Agastyaparva but - also the Uttarakhanda. -Some Krama-forms and interjections have been used in the Korava�rama and the Kufijarakarna, and it is possible that these works were composed in the fourteenth century A. D. The Koravd�rama has also a kidung recension.*

Let us next consider the Krsnantaka, an Old-Javanese poem based on some of the last books of the Mahabharata.
Dr. Van der Tuuk� says that the work is based on the last four parvans of the Mahabharata. Dr. Juynboll? rightly objects to the view on the ground that the author has not handled the Svargarohanaparvan in his work. The first four cantos* of this book are based on the A�gramavasaparvan, while the following twenty draw their main inspiration from the Mosalaparvan. The Prasthanikaparvan has been utilised in cantos XXV-XXXIV. - The author has mentioned his source in the tenth strophe of the thirty-fourth song, which also gives the name of the work.
It has also a prose-recension. As is to be expected, descriptions of natural scenery in the poetical recension are more elaborate than in the Old-Javanese prose-works of the Mahabharata. Cod. 4258 of this work ends with some

Sanskrit formulas in honour of GaneSsa and Sarasvati.

286 THE MAHARHARATA-CYCLE OF STORIES

Properly speaking, this book brings us to the close of our studies on the Mahabharata-cycle of stories in Java and Bali. From the tenth century of the Christian era to the fall of Majapahit c. 1478 A. D., the Mahabharata.
exerted a pronounced influence on the minds of the Kawi writers. The wealth of materials in the Mahabharata cds as varied as it is interesting and this has been greatly responsible for its popularity. Indeed, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Bharatayuddha and the Bhomakavya were so popular that some of the prominent figures in the above works were allegoricall, interpreted in the compositions called Prastuti ning kakawin' and Wayangan.*

From the fall of Majapahit to the present time, there has not been any similar activity in the domain of literature..
Artificiality in literature deepens during this period and an epoch of translation from the Kawi-works lengthens the shadows of the coming decline. Though some activities are noticeable under the Jasa di Puras in the beginning of the last century, they are not on a par with the works of their classical forefathers. Indeed, the five centuries, viz., c. 900-1400 Saka, . form. an epoch by . ifself.
which is in refreshing - contrast to the preceding and following periods of Indo- Javanese history. This classical period of Indo-Javanese literature has been what the Augustan Age has been in the Roman and the Periclean Age in the Greek history. Of these two, the Augustan Age forms a closer parallel. For just as the Roman literature of this period was overwhelmed by Greek thought and philosophy, so the literature of Java. and Bali bears the parmanent

stamp of the Indian genius that made a cultural conquest of the lands that "wind and twine about the equator like a.
chaplet of emeralds". 4

CHAPTER XIII THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES

The term Wayang literally means 'shadow." It is derived from the root Yang, to which the prefix wa has been added. In modern Javanese, the prefix wa has no function and, therefore, Dr. Hazeu postulates that the word is very old and partains to a time when the above prefix had some significance.* The term corresponds to the Sanskrit Chayandtaka, a literary genre that has found no welcome place in Sanskrit Dramaturgy. Though there are at least seven Indian works belonging to this category, the earliest of them, viz., the Ditangada of Subhata," has to be placed, according to its prastavant or prologue, in the reign of Tribhuvanapaladeva, a Calukya king of AnhiIvasd (1242-1243 A. D). Pischel� has succeeded in offering the true interpretation of the Chayanataka. It appears that the Sanskrit Cha@ydandtaka is the analogue of the Javanese Wayang Purva. In the present chapter we shall try to.
determine their mutual connexion. It will also be our endeavour to discuss the influence of Sanskrit Epics on the Wayang literature of Java and Bali. It is noteworthy,

~ however, that we do not find anything in Indonesia corresponding to the modern conceptions of the 'drama.'

._ The Javanese shows may be classified under seven categories: (1) The Wayang Purva, in which leather puppets project their shadows on a canvas, which is technically called Kelir ; (2) The Wayang Gedog, which is differentiated from the rest by the repertoire ; (3) the Wayang

Kelitik or Karucil, in which flat wooden puppets are represented ; (4) The Wayang Golek, in which clothed round puppets are shwon ; (5) The Top�ng, which is demonstrated by masked persons ; (6) The Wayang Wong, in which actors are not masked and they themselves speak ; (7) The Wayang B�b�r, in which plates portraying various scenes are unfolded.
_-_ Let us take up the Wayang Purva, which is probably the oldest of the seven groups described above. The term Purva is generally believed to be derived from the Parvan -of the Mahabharata, which lent its enormous resources to the Wayang literature of the Archipelago. - Shadows of fantastic and monstrous figures* are projected on a canvas usually with a red border and this is stretched out on a wooden frame called Panggung. Behind the canvas hangs a brass-lamp, which is technically called Blencong. Under it sits the dalang, whose functions are wider than those - of the Sftradhara of Sanskrit dramas. Clouse to him stands an oblong four-sided chest called Kotak, which contains accessories of shadow-plays, such as, weapons, horses, etc. When the dalang raises mimic battle-cries, he strikes two or three metal plates (keprak, kepyak or kecrek), attached to the chest. In his left hand, he holds a hammer of wood or a horn (tabuh keprak or cempala) to guide the musician sitting behind him. When the shadows are projected on the canvas, the dalang speaks in the rdle of persons, whom the shadows and puppets represent. He also recites some descriptions and suluks ; the latter is apparently a corruption of the Sanskrit 'Sloka.' Dr. Stutterheim" supposes that the Old-Javanese Ramayana was the fountain-head of these so-called suluks. As people became less accustomed to the Kawi-speech, these suluks were

1 Reproductions of them may be seen in J. Kats, Het Javaansche tooneel; also Handelingen van het eerste congres voor de Taal=, Land=en Volkenkunde van Java, 1919, Abrecht & Co., Weltevreden, 1921, etc.

2 ltama-legenden und Rama-reliefts in Indonesien, p. 66.

'CH.XIII] THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES 289

probably misapplied to heroes and heroines appearing in various roles. When giants appeared on the scene, suluks from the Ramayana were readily cited whether they were appropriate to the occasion on not.* The dalang, in such cases, modulated his voice according to various characters of the drama." At present the arrangement of seats is that men sit by the side of the dalang. They are, therefore, in a position to see both the puppets as well as the shadows they throw. Women, on the other hand, sit opposite the canvas, and accordingly they see nothing but shadows. Even now in Bali, Lombok and W. Java, men and women sit together before the canvas.?

Let us now trace the antiquity of the institution from early times. In an inscription of 762 Saka (840 A. D.), we find the words Juru banjol, Laringgit and Abanjol and they may doubtfully be connected with sha�ow-plays. According to Dr. Kern, the word Juru barata occurring in an inscription of 782 Saka (860 A. D.), may signify Wayangplayer or dalang. Prof. Vreede says that the beginning of the Balinese Brahmandapurana shows the influence of Wayang-shows. The first definite reference, which can be dated with some certainty, occurs in the Arjunavivahakakawin, a work composed in the reign of Airlangga in the beginning of the eleventh century A. D. Doubts may be entertained regarding references in earlier inscriptions, .but the work under review explicitly states :'Hanadnonton ringgit manangis asekel miida hidepan'* i.e., It is like some one who sees the Wayang and ere long begins to weep.

yuddha (Str. 664) and the Tantu Panggelaran (34)" suggest the prevalence of shadow-plays. The Old-Javanese Ramavijaya (7/12) also betrays traces of the same. A copper plate of 1058 A. D., discovered in the island of Bali, also speaks of Aringgit or Wayang.

It would appear from the above references that shadow plays were current in Java in the first half of the eleventh century A. D. Indeed, these became so popular in the following century that poets began to borrow comparisons from shadow-plays. Thus, Mpu Tanakung wrote in the V ritasancaya� :''Mountains produced the impression as if their trees were puppet-figures ; the fine transparent mist was, as it were, the canvas ; the hollow bamboos through which the wind passed were, as it were, the soft murmuring fudungans ; the warbling of quails, which was harmoniously relieved by the soft echo of stags, was, as it were, the Sarons ; the tunes of lovely peacocks yielded the Madrakasong

Shadow-plays were so old at the time of the present Tantu Panggelaran� that people eager - to offer an explanation of their origin connected them with the visit of gods. From the survey we have made above, it would appear that shadow-plays existed in the beginning of the 11th century A. D. and that orchestra was used in Wayangplays of the mid-twelfth century. According to Dr. Hazeu, the musical instruments of this time consisted of tudung, saron, kamanak, etc. In the Wayang Purva, musicians play with Gamelan Sal�ndro, while Gamelan P�log is customarily used in the Wayang Gedog. Some scholars

think that the Sal�ndro-scale is derived from Bengal, but the point is contested by others. *

._ _ Dr. Hazeu'* thought that these shadow-plays were indigenous in Java long before 950 Saka (1028 A. D.) and

they were even possibly known c. 800 Saka, if not earlier.
Dr. Brandes similarly surmised that Wayang-plays could be placed at about 778 A. D. The main arguments for their view are that the termini technici of shadow-plays are very old and unless we push back the date of these shows to c. 800 A. D., we cannot satisfactorily explain the technical terms. These remarks are partially corroborated by the original character of Wayang-shows and by the significance attached to the problems of Semar and his two sons. It has been suggested"? that the dalang was originally a priest, who offered worship to spirits represented by puppet-shadows cast on the curtain. Indeed, before the scene opens, the dalang presents offerings to the spirits and this is technically known as Sajen. The burning of franl�incense is also of primary importance in the beginning of the play. It has to be noted again that these shows are demonstrated at night, preferably a dark night, when spirits move about the earth in a care-free fashion." These plays serve as a means of contact between the living and the dead. With the evolution of finer thoughts and art, these moving shadows of spirits were transformed into fantastic Wayang-figures, which matched the uncouthness and un-manliness of hovering spirits. Even now they have no similarity with men.
Peoples of the Archipelago believe that these spirits can do much benefit to human beings if they will and therefore the shows are frequently arranged for curing various diseases.
Dr. Hazeu says* that shadow-plays were originally displayed by the head of the family ; but in course of time the duty devolved on a class of people, who became known as dalang. The details furnished above would become meaningless if we co not assume the origin of

shadow-plays from the worship of the dead." These two stages in the evolution of Wayang-play must have required at least 200 years, if not more. As the Arjunaviv@ha was composed in the beginning of the llth century A. D., its early history has to be referred to c. 800 A. D. According to Dr. Hosein Djajadiningrat," the Wayang Purva developed when Saivism was the predominant religion in Java. This time would naturally fall after 732 A. D. It has been suggested again that Semar and his two sons Petruk and Nalagareng were the heroes of the Javanese stage before they were relegated to the present degraded position of adherents of the Indian Epic heroes. In assuming such a state of things, we have to presuppose the conflict of Indo-Javanese art-techniques and the wide prevalence of knowledge of the main Epic characters of India: As the Ramayana was well-known in the ninth century A. D., Semar and his two sons are supposed to have ruled the stage before that time. It is difficult now to explain their position in regard to the spirit-worship. If shadow-plays originated form the above cult, Semar and his sons must have been essential factors in the conduct of the service. Otherwise they could have been easily pushed off from the history of the Javanese stage. A conjecture has been put forward that they represent Old-Javanese forefathers in the spiritworship and the case of Narada has been taken to illustrate how a god could be transformed into a clown.

Now the problem is, from which country was this shadow play obtained ? Is it of indigenous growth, or does it point to exotic influence ? Shadow-plays or similar shows were known in India, China, Cambodia, Siam, Malay peninsula, Java, Bali and even in the far-flung Turkey.: If they

are not the invention of the Javanese peoples, we shall have to trace their origin to those countries which had cultural contact with Java before the llth century A. D. Excepting Turkey, all the above-mentioned countries can claim that honour. It will be our endeavour to consider this question on its intrinsic merit. Let us take the case of India.
Nilakantha in his commentary on Riupopajivanam of the Mahabharata*� - writes : ''Riupopajivanam - jalamandapiketi daksinatyesu prasiddham, yatra siuksmavastram vyavadhaya carmamayairakarai rajamatyadinam carya - pradar�yate." Though details are lacking, it seems to be a prototype of the Javanese Wayang-play, because, we find here both the canvas as well as the leathern puppets. It is noteworthy, however, that shadow are called Wayang in Java ; in India, they were known as Jalamandapika and Riipopajivana. Though this reference is earlier than the earliest reference in Javanese literature and instriptions, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that Java obtained her shadow-plays from India. Because, the peoples of that island, who Indianised everything in the classical period of their history, in this instance only have shunned the termini technici of Indian dramaturgy for their stage. It is also a noticeable fact that while shadow-plays are not popular in India, they have kept alive the culture of classical Java. For the above reasons, again, we think that India did not borrow from Java ; the termini technici of her shadow-plays are purely Sanskritic and not Javanese.*� With extant materials, it is premature to theorise on their common origin.

Let us now consider if these shadow-plays were transmitted by the Chinese peoples to Indonesia. According to Prof. Schlegel," they were prevalent in China during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty (140-86 B. C.). But

in the present state of our knowledge there is no single

evidence to connect the two institutions. As a matter of fact, the important technical terms deviate surprisingly.
Besides, these shadow-plays, known as Pd-tee-hi in China, were not even popular there. When Fa-hian visited JavaSumatra in 414 A. D., he did not find any Chinese there.
As a matter of fact, Chinese influence does not appear to be of sufficient importance before the 13th century A. D., particularly before the time of Kublai Khan.t It is not probable, therefore, that Javanese Wayang-plays should owe their origin to Chinese sources. Far stronger are the reasons to doubt the indebtedness of Java to Siam and Cambodia.
Some scholars are of opinion that Javanese influence is greater on the dramaturgy of Siam and Cambodia than the reverse proposition. The word lakon, for example, is specifically Javanese and not Siamese, though it has made its way into the language of Siam. Similarly, Pafiji, known as Inao in Siamese stages, is one of the most important figures in Wayang-shows of Java. According to Brandes,?
these Pafiji-stories travelled to Siam and Cambodia from the island of Java. Because, proper names and geographical names in the Pafiji-romances of Siam and Cambodia� find their explanation from Java. The names of Koripan, Daha, Cindara or Cindaravati, amongst others, are illustrations of the above, Dr. Hazeu concludes therefore that the shadow plays are "wholly Javanese and nothing but Javanese."

The Javanese term lakon, which is derived from the root laku, roughly corresponds to the Greek word "drama".
All lakons are treated according to fixed rales, enunciated in the Ugerpedalangan or Fundamental rules for the guidance of dalangs.* All sub-divisions have particular technical

names, viz., suluk (recitation), pocapan - (conversation), penantang (challenge), prenesan (language of love), bafiolan (jesting) and so forth. Bafiolan is also referred to in inscriptions. It is here that we find Semar and his two sons with their stock of wits at full play. In the island of Bali, which borrowed the Wayang from Java, the role of these three clowns have been assumed by Bungut Swah, Mredah, Sengut, Gede Bahag, Twalen, Togok, Breta Abang-disin Setra, Pengakan-foman and Babadudan or Babangudan.

In the evolution of Javanese Wayang literature, six �different factors are noticeable :(1) The worship of forefathers or spirits, (2) The dramatisation of original Epic heroes,

(3) The confusion of Mal-Polynesian myths with Indian ones,

(4) The loss of knowledge in" the old language of Java and in the Epic lore of India, synchronizing with Muslim influence which brought about a certain amount of confusion,

(5) The influence of oral (wayang) and written (lajang) tradition on each other,"

(6) The influence of the people and the time-spirit.
Now, when this Wayang literature of Java is considered

in respect of its subject matter, it divides itself into several well-defined groups, viz.

(1) The Indian Epic cycle ; (2) the Damar Wulan cycle ;.
(3) the Pafji-cycle and (4) the Amir Hamza cycle. For our purpose, it is necessary to review this Wayang-literature in its relation to the Indian Epic cycle. When analysed, this is distributed over four well-defined groups� :1 Tidschrift T. I. T. L. VE., di. XXXIL, pp. s363ff ; Ed. Brandes, Pararaton in Verhand. Bat. (Genoot., dl.

296 THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES

(1) Early History and Mythology : Stories of gods and demons. A substantial portion of them is based upon the Adiparvan of the Mahabharata.

(2) The Rama-cycle of stories :

The ultimate source of these stories is the Ramayana, though they are primarily based upon the Serat Kanda and the Rama Keling-the counterparts of the Malay Hikaiats.

(3) The Arjuna-sahasra-vahu cycle of stories : These stories are based upon some personalities from the Rama-saga.

(4) The Pandava-cycle of stories :

These stories are based upon the Mahabharata. Some figures of the Ramayana have also been mixed up with this Pandava-cycle, For example, Hanuman figures as a brother of Vrkodara in a Pandava lakon, viz., Ghatotkaca daup kalijan Devi Pregiva.

The Wayang Purva deals with the stories relating to the earliest times of Javanese history. These consist not only of Old-Javanese or pure Mal-Polynesian myths but also of Indian myths which have been worked up into the lakons. We may refer the lakons Watu gunung' and Jamur dipa� to the first category. The latter lakon has been borrowed from the Manik Maya, to which also belongs the lakon Mengukuhan. Under the same category possibly comes 'the lakon Murvakala or Purvakala, since this show was intended to ward off harm and redeem the sorrows of afflicted persons.} The Tantu Panggelaran has also exercised its influence on some sketches, The lakon Mintaraga, on the other hand, is based

the Mahabharata, and it describes the subject of Arjuna's marriage with Subadra (Subhadra), which is the theme of the Parthayajfia mentioned by Winter. Nearly related to it is the Lahire Ghatotkaca, which narrates the birth of that epic-hero. - Indeed, a large number of lakons has been borrowed from various sections of the Mahabharata. Kern' has shown that the lakon Obong-obongan bale si galagala is based upon the Jatugrhaparva of the Adiparvan, though.
the latter portion of the lakon, according to Dr. Juynboll,* reminds one of the Virataparvan. Dr. Hazeu has also referred the lakon Palasara (Paragara) to relevant portions of the Adiparvan. Similarly, the lakon Arimba draws its main inspiration from the Hidimbavadhaparvan of the Mahabharata (Adi) and from the Harivam�am.� The lakon Panduis known to us through the edition of Roorda* and the translation of Van der Vliet." We should like to offer a short summary of this lakon to illustrate the general characteristics of Javanese Wayang stories. The dramatis personae of this lakon are :Kunti-boja ...- King of Mandura.

The legend belongs to the Pandava-cycle of stories from the Mahabharata. The main interest of the story centres round three persons, viz., Palasara (Parafgara), Abiasa (Vyasa) and Pandu-grandfather, son and grandson-whose activities form the nucleus of the Wayang story.
Of these three characters, Pandu is the title- hero and his: chivalrous career has lent an additional charm to the main course of the story, which, for the sake of convenience may be divided into four sections.

The first section begins with an account of Devi Kunti (Devi Kunti), daughter of Kunti Boja, king of Mandura.
Abducted by two monsters, Awah Muka and Ari Muka, she was saved by the intervention of the Sun-god, who, enchanted by the loveliness of the princess, had amours with her. - As the monsters had made the grim determination of forcibly taking her away, the Sun-god challenged them to fight out the issue. Laurels graced the Sun-god, whose victory relieved the anxiety of Devi Kunti. The first section of this story, therefore, contains the germs of medieval romance-an enchanting princess, a tournament, gallery of fighters, etc. The monsters, who temporarily �disappeared from the scene, re-appeared at the Svayamuara of Devi Kunti.

The s�cond section presents to us the younger brother of Kunti boja named Gangaspati, who had a demoniac figure. He passed the gloomy hours of his life in a secluded

monastery with his beautiful: daughter, named Satyavati.
Like many a heroine of Bengali folk-tales, Satyavati saw in her dream a stalwart knight-errant, with whom she fell in love. Gangaspati, her father, went out to discover this unknown hero and returned with Narasoma, who was banished by his father, king of Mandaraka, - for refusing to marry. Narasoma was utterly amazed to see the loveliness of this maiden. He said, however, that he could not marry 'the daughter of a person who was more of a monster than a man. So willingly, Gangaspati allowed himself to be killed in cold blood ; after this the hero and the heroine began to live together. At this stage, Narasoma was recalled to the court of his father, but he was again exiled

on account of the murder he had committed. previously.
He then proceeded towards Mandura in order to present

himself at the Svayamuvara of Kunti mentioned above. He was followed by his sister.

The scene of the third section opens in the kingdom of Astina (Hastina), where Abiasa was the ruling chief.
He had three sons, viz., Destarata, Pandu and Yamavidura, of whom the first was blind and the last was a cripple.
Their father Abiasa was anxious to see them married and, as Pandu had the best chance of getting a wife, he was sent 'to the Svayamvara of Mandura. His father also proceeded thither in an aerial car. After their arrival in Mandura, they found that the Svayamuvara was over and Narasoma, with the help of some charms, had overcome the two giants, Awah Muka and Ari Muka. Being pressed by Abiasa, the king of Mandura arranged a combat between Pandu and Narasoma. 'Narasoma used some charms. ~The young

prince of Gendaridesa, who was travelling along with: his sister Angendari. As our hero got the better of the prince of Gendaridesa, the latter was constrained to give his sister to Pandu, who thus came home with four princesses, viz., Kunti, Patah, Madrin (sister of Narasoma) and Angendari. He gave his blind eldest brother the liberty of selecting one of these girls and his choice fell on the last..
Yamavidura selected Patah, and the remaining fell to the share of Pandu. The Wayang-story says that Destarata had 150 sons by Angendari, the princess of Gendaridesa.

There are also some lakons based on the Ramayana. Dr.
Juynboll* has discussed a few of them with some valuable results. A comparison of the Rama saweg wonten ing Mantildireja, for example, with Javanese and Malay texts.
has enabled him to state that the source of this lakon i is the Rama Keling. The story of this work begins after the marriage of Rama. The Story of Legutama similarly gives an account of the earlier history of Sugriva and Suvali, while the Lembu sura ing negara guva kiskenda describes the episode

of the buffalo. The Rama Tambak, Hanuman Duta, Rama Gandrung and the Brubok also belong to Wayang-stories of the Rama-cycle. Among other lakons, we find the Lahire Dasamuka, which describes earlier history and the birth of Dasamuka,* i.e., Ravana. Nearly related to it is the Lahire Indrajit, which narrates how Dasamuka forcibly abducted a vidadari from Indra and how she bore him a son named Indrajit. Similarly, the lakon Dasamuka tftapaturu describes how the pseudo-Mandudari was surrendered to Dasamuka. Here she is known as Devi Rago. The story of Lokapala, on the other hand, handles the story of the defeat of king Visravana by Dasamuka. The fight of Sasrabahu with Dasamuka also forms the kernel of a lakon.
In the Babang Sumantri, we come across a description of the battle between Dasamuka and the brothers of Sasrabahu.* 1 Bijdragen T. L, FK., di. 54, pp. 501-565.
2 This is equivalent to Da�amukha.

CH.XIII| THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES 301

There are some other lakons belonging to the Arjuna-sahasravahu-cycle. �

It would appear from the above description that these lakons are of comparatively modern times and that they draw their main inspiration from the later versions of the Ramayana, such as the Serat Kanda, the Rama Keling, etc.
Many lakons are now staged on the occasion of some feasts, e. g., the tingkeb-feast and the Pupak-pusar feast.* - Such plays are known as Serat wawacan (Srivacan) or waosan.
"Those of comparatively earlier times are known as Serat kanda ringgit. The Bandung, which falls into this category, has been described by Prof. Vreede.*

With this review we bring our discussion on the main ~

Wayang stories of the Indian Epic-cycle to a close. The Pafji, Damar Wulan and the Amir Hamza cycles do not, strictly speaking, come within our "purview, because, their sources have been traced elsewhere. To make the picture complete, however, we shall give a brief resume .of other forms of Javanese Wayang shows, which are only partially related to Indian Epic-cycles.

After the Wayang Purva developed a different type of show, called the Gedog, which, according to Serrurier, has to be placed� during the palmy days of Majapahit.
The meaning of the term is not clear. According to some scholars, Gedog means 'horse', because, Pafiji, the hero of this show, bears titles which signify 'horse', e.g., Kuda Wanengpati, Undakan Wasengsari, Inu Jaran, etc. Some other explanations have been offered, but they are less satisfactory. Both the Wayang Purva and the Wayang Gedog use leetheppuppets, whose shadows are projected on the canvas or screen. The hero of the latter is Raden Pafiji, the prince of Janggala, who is an embodiment of beauty and strength. He is particularly beloved of gods and women. The love-adventures of this prince with

302 THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES

Devi Angreni, Candra Kirana ( Sekar Taji) and other princesses, his fight with all sorts of kings, particularly the kings of the overseas, form the subject of dramas staged at the Wayang Gedog. Here also we find the clowns, Semar and his two sons. The dressing of the puppets in the Wayang Gedog, particularly the adornment, is.
different from that of the Wayang Purva� The kris is also used here for the first time. The main difference between these two shows is that while the Wayang Purva: draws its materials mainly from the Indian epics, the Wayang Gedog is primarily based upon the Pafiji-romances.
The Wayang Kelitik or Karucil is not a shadow-play, but a puppet-show. The words are derived from the primary roots tik and cil, which signify "little or trifling." And the title is appropriate, because, in the place of fantastic shadows cast on the screen, peoples see in these shows only little puppets. Thus the name of the show is derived from.
the puppets and not, as in the first two cases, from the repertoire or the subject-matter staged. By making a foursided opening in the middle of the canvas, these puppets are shown. Later on, the use of this canvas (kelir dadakan) was given up altogether. Some scholars are inclined to believe that this show originated in the Majapahit period.
Be that as it may, the Wayang Kelitik has no religious background and, sometimes it continues not only through nights but also through days. It has been mentioned in the Pafiji poem Malat, which cannot be later than c. 1500 A. D.� The Wayang Kelitik deals with the Damar Wulan cycle.
Damar Wulan is descended from the groom of the king of Majapahit and he is an exact prototype of the other Don.
Juan, viz., Pafiji. The role of Semar and his sons is here performed by Sabda Palon and Naya Gengong, two servants

of Damar Wulan." In this show, we have the music of Gamelan laras miring. '

The same music is played in the Wayang Golek, in which round and thick wooden puppets are used. Though the lower part of these puppets is covered with linen, the upper part generally remains bare. It has been conjectured that this show might be an imitation of the of the Chinese of South Fuh-kjen.* - It is popular in West Java and is based upon the stories of the Indian Epic cycle and the Damar Wulan cycle.?

In the Wayang Top�ng, masked persons appear in the r�le of puppets. It is accompanied by song, dance and music. - The show appears to be as old as the shadow-play, because, it has not only been explicitly mentioned in the Middle-Javanese Pafijji-romance Malat (2/15), but also its existence in early times seems to he testified by the Adiparva, the prose-recension of the Brahmandapurana, an inscription of 980 Saka, and the (66/5)." Though Serrurier* has sought to derive the origin of this show from India, there is no adequate ground for that conjecture. As a matter of fact, such shows were current among various primitive tribes, who had no contact with one another. This show is partly connected with religion, particularly with the performance of funeral rites. In this show, it is customary to play with Gamelan Sal�ndro.
When the number of masks was increased to 27, actors introduced in the show the Story of Jaka Semawung.� A second story, viz., Jaka Bluwo� was introduced at the time

of the foundation of Mataram, when the number of masks was increased to 40. Two other stories called Jaka Pefijaring

and Kuda Naravarsa were introduced in 1680 A. D.
and 1749 A. D. respectively. Pafiji is the hero of this show.

The Wayang Wong nearly corresponds to the drama of our own times. It developed in the middle of the 18th century A. D. under the auspices of Mangku Negara I. The appearance of men in the place of puppets was looked upon with some apprehension. It never became popular in Java, though it began to find some favour in royal quarters from 1881 A. D. onwards. The repertoire is principally borrowed from the Wayang Purva." The Wayang B�b�r, however, is in sharp contrast to those described above.
According to Serrurier and some other scholars, it betrays the original form of the Wayang. About it, we read in the Ying-yai-sheng-lan (1416), "There is a sort of men who paint on paper men, birds, animals, insects and so on ; the paper is like a scroll andis fixed between two wooden rollers three feet high ; at one side these rollers are level with the paper, whilst they protrude at the otherside. The man squats down on the ground and places the picture before him, unrolling one part after the other and turning it towards the spectators, whilst in the native language and in a loud voice he gives an explanation of every part ; the spectators sit around him and listen, laughing or crying according to what he tells them."* It is conducted without any musical instrument. Before the show begins, the dalang burns frankincense, mutters a prayer and strikes cempala against a box. lt presents scenes from all the cycles excepting probably the Amir Hamza cycle. The Wayang B�b�r had its parallel in the ancient Indian picture show -man. It appears, however, from the Mahabhasya of Patafijali (140 B.C.), the Midraraksasa of (Act I)

identical. Apart from the question of nomenclature, which differs widely in these two cases,* the Javanese show begins with some compulsory ceremonies, which are not suggested .
in Indian works. It might be that the show went from India to Java, but in the present state of our knowledge it is not possible to be sure on this point. This show is seldom noticed in modern Java.

Wayang shows went from Java to Bali. Dr. Van der _Tuuk� says, "The Balinese call Parva every prose composition which has been worked up into a poetical form. Their Wayang or puppet-show is called Wayang Parva {(or, according to Balinese pronunciation : prava)... The Balinese Wayang is pagan and its heroes are those of the Arjunavivaha, the Ramayana, the Bharatayuddha, the Bhomakavya, in fact all the poems in which Indian heroes are the chief actors.'' The Balinese dalang borrowed his subjects directly from the poems and not from a pakem or proseextract. Mask plays also exist in Bali, though the subjects they handle are derived from the Middle-Javanese Rangga Lawe and not, as in Java, from the According to some Scholars, the shadow-plays of Sumatra, Malacca and Riouy are derived from Java. The dalang is here called Pawang, which has been supposed to be a corruption of Pahyang. It corresponds to the Javanese term. The subjects of these shows are borrowed from the Malay Seri Rama and other writings like the Ken Tambuhan, Bidasari, etc.

We thus come to the end of our studies on the Wayang literature of Java and Bali. The spirit of classical times has doubtless been preserved by these plays, but they have also been responsible for the re-orientation of many Indian epic stories. The greatest harm they have done is

306 - THE EPIC LITERATURE AND WAYANG STORIES

that the suggestive symbolical character of many Indian stories has been greatly lost in Wayang-forms. But these are inevitable in a country which is situated far-off from India. The time-spirit and the temperament of peoples are also great factors in the curious presentation of Indian Epic heroes on the stages of Indonesia. These shows, at any rate, were very popular in Java. The Ramayana-reliefs of the Panataran temple permanently bear the fantastic

styles of Wayang-figures and they stand in sharp contrast to the more human and natural scenes of the Prambanan.

CHAPTER XIV

MISCELLANEOUS WORKS OF JAVA AND BALI

In this chapter we shall consider some works which stand either outside the Epic-cycle or whose themes are found in a large number of writings in Ancient India. In any case, it is not easy to determine the exact source of these works. And, therefore, they can conveniently form a group by themselves. We shall begin our studies with the Smaradahana,* which, as we have seen before, has assumed enormous importance in connexion with the chronology of Old-Javanese literature. It is further believed that the work throws some light on the problems of Pafijiromances and on the personality of a king" of ancient Java.

The main contents of the story may be described as follows :Xn"

The first canto opens with an invocation to the Lovegod Kama, which is also a glorification to the reigning king (1-6 )." The name of Mpu Dharmaja, author of this work, is mentioned in the seventh strophe.
The main story of the Smaradahana, however, begins with the following strophe. It describes that in early times Siva went to perform Yoga-penances on Mount Meru under the shadows of a dargana-tree ( 8-10 ). The gods of heaven with Sakra at their head, the siddhas, rsis, gandharvas and apsaras, were much concerned at the depredations of the demon-king Nilarudraka, whose capital Senapura stood on the Southern foot of the Himalayas (11-14).

The gods, on the advice of Brhaspati, sought the help of Kama, who was asked to awaken the love of Siva for Parvati. - The elephant-headed son, born of their union, they thought, would alone be able to bring about the fall of the demon-king ( 15-16 ). The poet then praises Brhaspati, who was versed in the Vedas and in the lore of Kutaramantra, Canakya and Kamandaka (17). The gods accordingly repaired to the residence of Kama, which was a veritable palace of flowers. Its description continues up to the end of this canto ( 18-23 ).

The second canto describes the arrival of the gods and the welcome accorded to them by Kama, the god of Love (1). Indra and Brhaspati impressed upon him the necessity of killing Nilarudraka. As Kama feared the wrath of Siva, the gods said that if the worst happens inspite of the mild nature of Siva, he could be revived by amrta (2-6). Kama, thus assured, went into the pavilion stretched out under an Afoka-tree, where Ratih, his wife was staying. The gods meanwhile left the palace of Kama ( 7-19 ).

The following two cantos describe the separation of Kama and Ratih. The latter would not allow him to go inspite of the necessity of the gods. She feared that her beloved husband would not return to her any more. - The fifth song describes the departure of Kama to the accompaniment of gods and rsis. In the next canto we find them on Mount Meru (1). With their arrival, a heavy thunderstorm broke out in unabated fury (3-4).
They saw Nandi�vara and Mahakala, two door-wardens of Siva, who had distinct orders not to allow anybody in.
After expressing good intentions for his arrival, Kama went in and saw (15) Siva under a dar�ana-tree.

The seventh canto describes the efforts of Kama to spoil the penances of Siva. He discharged all his flowerarrows on him, but they became ornaments on the body of Siva. His form now assumed double beauty (1-7). At last, he shot the most powerful visaya-arrow, which struck him in the heart (11-12). The following canto continues the theme of the previous sarga. Siva hit by

CH. XIV] MISCELLANEOUS WORKS 309

the arrow, immediately thought of Uma, the daughter of the mountain (1). He also observed that Kama with outstretched bow was aiming at him for the second time (3).
He expressed himself in his Rudra-form with five heads and thousand arms (8-10). Kama, who noticed the danger, called the gods for help ; but they left him in the lurch (11-12).
Siva now focussed the fire of his third eye on Kama, who was gradually scorched to ashes (13-15). The soul of Kama went to heaven (23),

The opening of the ninth canto breathes a melancholy tone (1-6). For fear of his own life, Indra wanted to turn back inspite of the remonstrances of Brhaspati, who asked him to lead a deputation to Siva (7-17). Their invocation to Siva forms the subject of the next two cantos. Being asked about the object of their arrival, Brhaspati craved forgiveness for Kama (1-4)* and described the necessity which compelled the gods to take to that course (5-10).
Siva said that Kama would no longer move about in human form ; his body would be transformed into the finest elements (11-13).

Indra then saw the body of Kama, which was not yet wholly burnt to ashes (3)�. The dying Love-god asked Indra to maintain the friendship that subsisted between them and requested him further to take charge of Ratibh, his beloved wife (4-8). The seven rsis and Indra then turned back to their respective quarters (9-11). The next three cantos (XIV-XVI) are indecent.

The seventeenth sarga, which contains only one strophe, describes the anguishes of Ratih. The next canto, however, opens (1-6) with a description of natural scenery, which is brought in sharp contrast with the sorrows of Ratih. A messenger of Indra arrived with the news of Kama's death.
She became senseless and thrice threw herself upon the floor (7-11). At last she addressed Brhaspati in piteous terms and held the gods responsible for the untimely death of her husband (1-9).� Brhaspati then related the whole affair

leading to the burning of Kama and consoled her by pointing to the transitoriness of life, which was just like the winddriven clouds (10-17).

In the twentieth canto we find Ratih taking leave of gods to seek her husband through death. The deities lauded the proposal and blessed her (1-8). The kraton was deserted now. Accompanied by Nanda and Sunanda, she traversed the beautiful landscape of Ilavrta, which lay at the Western foot of the Mahameru (9-13). The following sarga describes the morning when Ratih arrived there. She discerned the place where Kama was burnt and began to weep (1-13). Her sorrows found expression in words and these are described in canto XXII (1-17). The flickering embers had not yet died out and Ratih discovered the last mortal remains of Kama, which proclaimed eternal love for Ratih. She was invited to follow-him in death (18-21). In the first strophe of the twenty-third canto we find Siva, who was observing all these with eager affection. He allowed the fire to burn once more quickly and Ratih, with her maid-servants, plunged therein to die (i-8).* The two spirits were thus united. But as they did not possess any material form, they sought contentment through Siva and Uma. The poet then describes the amours of the two, who were longing for each other in passionate love (cantos XXIV-XXVII). Uma became pregnant.

The following canto opens with the story of the gods who were spinning out a trick to misshape the head of the unborn child (1-4). All gods went to Siva along with the great Airavana elephant of Indra. When Uma saw the huge beast coming like a moving hill, she screamed in fear (5-8). The gods fearing the curse of Uma immediately fied. The consort of Siva bore thereafter an elephant- headed son,

named Gana. As Uma was very crest-fallen over the birth of such a son, Siva consoled her (9-15). The uneasiness of the demon-king of Senipura is described in the opening section of canto XXIX. He sent two spies to see if really

a son was born to Siva. When the news was confirmed, he ordered a general mobilisation of the demon-army (1-8). The

invasion of the demons is described in songs XXX-XXXI.
Everything was destroyed and the gods sought the help of

Gana, who, though young, was transformed into a grown-up hero (canto XXXI). The vicissitudes of the war are described up to the thirty-sizxth canto which describes the death of the demon-king. After the victory, the gods returned to heaven and held festivities to commemorate their triumph.
After a short reference to these celebrations, the poet again touches the story of Kama and his wife in songs XXXVIII XXXIX. Now it happened that while Uma and Siva were wandering about Mount Meru, they saw the glowing ashes of Kama. Being asked about the incident, Siva related the whole history to Uma and she realised that Kama was at the root of their mutual love. She, therefore, requested her husband to transform the ashes of Kama into the deity that he was.
Siva replied that the time was passed ; since Kama had already re-incarnated himself in Namusti (1-7). So also Ratih, who was re-born in princess Ratnavati, daughter of Vikrama(ditya) of Ujjayini in Malwa. Her ashes still remain in the cloister of Taladhvaja (8). The second incarnation of Kama was king Satanisthana, famous under the name of Udayana, belonging to the race of the Pandavas (9). Ratih also split up herself into two : one part became Basavada, daughter of Candrasena ; the other part became Ratnavali, daughter of Aryasuta Vikramabahu of Ceylon. As Ratnavali was found in the sea, she became known as Sagarika or . Daughter of the Sea (10-11). Both of them were married to , Udayana. In the thirteenth strophe, the poet shifts the scene to Java's Middle-land in the south ("'daksinapathe

himself in Java, Ratih did not lag behind. Indeed, in Janggala she was "a flower among women"" (15). She was like the rays of the Moon and people called her Queen Kirana (i. e. rays).
The next canto'* describes king as an incarnation of Kama. The second strophe of this song speaks of Dahana as the wonder of the world (""'Dahanarajyapurva dening jagat'). The river which flowed by the town has been described as originating from "tears of the wives.

The fortieth or the last canto speaks of the poet and his work. The wark was also very popular in Bali.� ajwaefore we take up the historical aspect of the present work; we shall try to determine the source from which it has borrowed its materials. In the Pamaficangah kidung, it has been stated that the poet Dharmaja obtained his materials from the Candapurana, which has been supposed to be a corruption of the Skandapurana.� Though the kernel of the story occurs in the Kumadrasambhava and some other works of Ancient India, the reference to the Skandapurana is rather interesting. But on comparison, we find that the texts of the Smaradahana and the Skandapurana differ from each other in important detail. In the latter work, the story has been told in two places.* Both in the Visnukhanda as well as in the Mahesvarakhanda, the name of the demon appears

as Tarakasura and not Nilarudraka. The author relates here the birth of Kumara and not GaneSfa. The various incarnations of Kama, as described here, are not similar to those of the Smaradahana. Besides, Rati of the Skandapurana was dissuaded by a celestial voice from burning herself along with her As a matter of fact, she was abducted by the demon Samvara while she was performing penances.* The name of the arrow which struck Siva is here Mohanakhya and not Visaya." These are sufficient arguments to prove the worthlessness of the information supplied by the kidung regarding the source of the Smaradahana.

As regards the historical aspects of the poem, we have already tried to prove that king Kamesvara of the poem is no other than king Kamefsvara l. If the expression "Sriganadharma - maka punya '*} is construed to mean that he is a lineal descendant of king ISanadharma, then this is a correct statement. If, on the other hand, it was the intention of the poet to describe him as the father of king then he must be diferent from Sindok. Any way, this point does not help us in solving the knotty chronological problem of the Smaradahana. R. ng. Dr. Poerbatjaraka� - has further tried to show that this Kamesvara and his wife Kirana ratu are the main players of the Pafji-romances on the following grounds :(1) In the sixth strophe of the first canto, we read, "Van ring prang kita singha vira - tarunariapafiji rana", i.e., In war, you are the young alert lion-hero Apafiji rana.

Candrakirana is Raden Pafiji, and when we know that ratu Kirana is the wife of king Kamegvara I who is also known as Pafji or better Apafji, it appears probable that Kamesvara | is the Raden Pafifi of Javanese traditions.

(2) Pafji is a veritable Don Juan such as the name of Kame&vara also signifies.

(3) It is also noteworthy that Moon-symbols are used

in the inscriptions of Kamesgvara I.

Let us see how far these points are tenable. We are inclined to believe that the first argument by itself does not support the hypothesis of Dr. Poerbatjaraka.
If the statement was intended for comparison, it fails to establish the identity of the two. Dr. Poerbatjaraka's point, however, gains some support from elsewhere and on different grounds. In a Malay story,* the epithet of king Kame�gvara, viz., Apafiji sureng rana, also appears as the epithet of Ino, who is described there as Surengrana Panji Kusuma Indra. When taken together, these points seem to carry some weight. But the Pafijiromances furnish some difficulties. In them we find that Raden Pafiji is the crown-prince of Janggala (Koripan) and his beloved Candrakirana is the princess of Daha. As we have seen before, a different account is given by the Smaradahana. Dr. Poerbatjaraka has sought to explain this anomaly by doubting the veracity of traditions. But why should we question them when we find that Pafiji is systematically presented as the crown-prince of Janggala and Candrakirana as the princess of Daha? So the gulf between Smaradahana and the Pafiji-romances can not be bridged on these grounds.

Let us now take up the second argument. It is quite true that Pafiji is a veritable Don Juan-a great lover of women. - But it would not be a good argument to connect him with king merely on the strength of the name. Besides, the adventures of both the Kame�svaras are wholly unknown to history. And Pafji,

1 C#. Rassers, De Pandji Rormanr, p. 140,

CH. XIV] MISCELLANEOUS WORKS 3185

without them, is a miserable figure in the romantic literature of Indonesia. Dr. Rassers� remarks further that, according to the poem, Kamesvara's wife is known among the people as Kirana only. - This implies that Kirana was not her usual name. Moon symbols, however, may be of some help in establishing the identity of king KameSvara with Pafj, "'about whose Moon-character there can not be any doubt."" It is equally significant that these same inscriptions mention neither Kame�vara 1 nor Kame�Svara II as incarnation of the Love-god Kama. As a matter of fact, a record Of 1107 Saka describes as an incarnation of Trivikrama, i.e., Visnu. Thus, while the constructive effort of R. ng. Dr. Poerbatjaraka is laudable enough, it does not remove our difficulties. It may be possible that Kamesvara I is the hero of Pafiji-romances, but with the materials at our disposal, we cannot be definite about it.
There are some other names in the 3maradahana which � find explanation from Indian history and literature. Dr.
Poerbatjaraka� has already pointed out that by Udayana the poet probably meant the well-known king of Vatsa, who was imprisoned by Candasena,* king of Ujjayini. He was ultimately freed by Yaugandharayana. The adventures of king Udayana are vividly narrated in the Svapnavasavadatta, attributed to Bhasa� and in the Kathasaritsagarah of Somadeva. He is also the hero of the Ratnavali. In the present work, king Udayana has been described as the king of Hastina. We also read in the Kathasaritsagarah, "'This lord of Vatsa is sprung from the Pandava race and the whole earth is his by hereditary descent, as also the city named of the elephant,"' i. e., The name of Candamaha1 Rassers, De Pandji Roman, p. 302. 2 Ibid., p. 200.

3 Tijdschrift Y. I. T. L. TK., dl. LVIII, pp. 485f.

4 It should be Candamahasena.

5 Dr. Poerbatjaraka has committed a mistake here. Because, the adventures of Kandarpaketmw are described in the Fdsuvadatta of Bubandhu, and not the adventures of king Udayana.

sena has been transformed here into Candrasena and thename of Vasavadatta appears as Vasavada. It is true that Vasavadatta is the wife of Udayana and the account of their romantic elopement has formed the theme of many poets.
Kalidasa,* for example, refers to "Udayanakatha-kovidgramavrddhan,"' i. e., old men of villages expert in the tales.
of Udayana. Ratnavali, too, is a princess of Ceylon and she is the second wife of king Udayana. After her shipwreck, she became famous under the name of Sagarika.
Her father, according to the joint-testimony of the Smaradahana and the Sanskrit Ratnavali, " is Vikramavahu.

{,; - From the tenth and the eleventh canto of this work, it appears that the writer, like Yogigvara, was thoroughly conversant with Saiva doctrines. It is possible that both of them subscribed to this faith. The theme of the present work was very popular in Greater India. It has not only been described in the inscriptions of Campa, but has alsobeen vividly represented in the reliefs of Angkor Vat and Bayon in Cambodia.* The scenes depicted in the last two structures are almost identical. In the lower part of the relief, we find Kama discharging his arrow of sugar-cane toSiva, who has been represented in the upper part of the panel with rosary and knotted locks. We find Uma in the neighbourhood of Siva and also notice a servant bearing trigiila or trident. The next scene depicts the burnt deity in the lap of Rati. It appears, however, that the tradition

of the Khmer artists and of Dharmaja, the writer of the Smaradahana, was not identical.

The kakawin Lubdhaka, which we propose to discuss.

sion. In Sanskrit, the name of the title-hero itself signifies a hunter and, therefore, the selection of the name by the poet probably implies the poor equipment of the author in Sanskrit. The story runs as follows. In a pitch-dark night, hunter Lubdhaka had seated himself on the branch of a V ilva-tree out of extreme fear. - Under the shade of the tree, there was a holy Sivalinga. The weight of his body coupled with his convulsions of fear brought down some leaves on the holy linga below. Though this happened without his knowledge, the act sufficed to secure him a passport to heaven. After his death, there was a tussel over his soul between the followers of Yama and Siva and this is described in cantos XX-XXIX. At last the followers of Siva succeeded in releasing his soul from the clutches of their opponents. The name of the poet, Mpu Tanakung, appears from the thirty-eighth canto. an It is difficult to trace the source of the present work.
It cannot be expected that we shall find the name of the hunter as Lubdhaka in parallel Indian stories. As a matter of fact, in the Sivapuranam,* Rurudraha is the name of the hunter. In the Bengali recension of the Mahabharata by Kagirama Dasa,* the name of the hunter appears as Susvara.
In the former version of the story, Vilva-leaves fell on the Sivalinga not out of convulsions of the hunter, but on account of his attempt to kill a roe. The story also occurs in some other Pauranic works, but the outline makes a wide departure from that of the above three works.

The work has its problem of dates. In the begining of the poem, we read, '"'Sang hyang ning hyang amiirti niskala," and this may refer to the Love-god Kama." One may even conjecture that the phrase refers to king Kamedgvara, This hypothesis seems to receive some support on two grounds.
According to the Balinese tradition, a certain Mpu Tanakung is the brother of Dharmaja, the writer of the Smaradahana.

We have tried to prove before that the latter kakawin was composed in the reign of Kamegvara I. Now, if the writer of the Lubdhaka is identical with the writer of the Vrttasaficaya, he must have flourished in the second quarter of the twelfth century A. D., when the kakawin of Dharmaja was composed. According to the Wawatekan reference, again, the Lubdhaka was composed in 1128 A. D. So, two.
independent testimonies and the Balinese tradition lend.
their support for placing it in the reign of Kamesvara I.
More explicit internal evidence, on the other hand, goes to.
show that the work could not have been composed before 1222 A. D. Unless these latter references are proved to be spurious, we shall regard this Tanakung to be a different person from the author of the Vriftasaficaya, as we have already suggested. a Let us now take up the story of Sutasoma, which is also.
known as Purugadasanta.' Purusada, a demon, who had imprisoned all kings of Baratavarsa (Bharatavarsa) and had conquered the ratu Darma was ultimately overcome by Sutasoma and his relative Prabu Maketu. Sutasoma is an incarnation of Bodhisattva and his adventures have been described in the work. This story is widely distributed in the lands of Eastern Asia. We find the story not only in India, but also in Tibet, China, Japan, Java and some other places of the Indian Archipelago. This curious legend of the cannibal king Saudasa has been worked out to preach the gospel of the Mahayanist school, though its doctrines have also been tinctured with traces of Saivism. On fol. 120a, we find, ''The god Buddha differs not from Siva, the king of gods." Again, "The nature of Jina and the nature of Siva are one ; they are distinguished and yet the same being." � Such passages betray the compromising spirit of the tenets.
of Buddhism and Saivism, which led to the development of

the Siva-Buddha cult. They have been further worked out into a peculiar synthesis of Hinduistic Trinity and the Dhyanibuddhahood of the Northern church. Thus we find Aksobhya as lT�vara, Ratnasambhava as Brahma or the creator, Amitabha as Mahamara (Mahadeva) and Amoghasiddhi as Visnu. Dr. Krom* observes quite correctly that the peculiarity of the arrangement lies in the fact that Siva has been represented twice, evidently to fit a set of four into a set of three. When the cannibal Saudasa was converted into a monk, Sutasoma recommended to him the worship of Vajrapani, "the lord of the air."" The author also refers to 'Japa-yoga-siddhi,' which may belong either to the Buddhist or Brahmanical school of Tantrism. We see thus that the story of Sutasoma in the Old-Javanese literature is a curious synthesis of Mahayana and Brahmanical philosophy of the fourteenth century A. D. s

Dr. Watanabe� writes, "It is an important and interesting fact that we can trace this story so far back as the Vedic age. Vestiges are found not only in many commentaries, but even in the Rgveda itself...... The story, commencing with the Vedic age, reaches to the later time of the Puranas, with various tendencies and features representing the literature of different periods. It was a common property to the poets of Brahmanmism, Buddhism.... and Jainism." The story is not only preserved in the Ramayana, the Maha bharata, the Visnupura na, etc., but also in at least twentyone texts of the Buddhist literature of India, China and Tibet.? As the evolution of the story has been consummately traced and the frame-work thoroughly analysed by Dr.
Watanabe and Prof. Kern,* we do not think it necessary to.
dwell upon these points any longer. For our present purpose, it is necessary to bear in mind that "in the later form

of ths Kalmasapada legend, the Buddhists received a considerable influence from the Mahabharata." "�

Dr. Kern thinks that the story of Sutasoma was originaly a nature-myth, which gradually developed into an edifying story with a moral. According to the same scholar, again, the legend is not based on the myth of a Sun-eclipse but on a Moon-eclipse. His reason for that conjecture is that the main interest of the story is created by Kalmasapada holding Sutasoma, who is released soon afterwards. Now, Kalmasa is verily a synonym for tamas, i.e., darkness ; the term pada may signify either 'feet' or

U

'rays. - Similarly, the name 'Sutasoma' may mean the soma pressed or the begotten Moon. In many texts, the name of Kalmasapada is not explained at all. Dr. Kern says that when men could no more comprehend the idea of the myth, some, narrator took up the name and explained it as 'spotted feet," and in illustration thereof discovered a little story such as we find in the Ramayana and the Visnupurana.
The traces of the myth, however, persisted in many places of the legend. In the Jatakamala, for example, the child has been described as lovely as the Moon. The JayaddisaJataka (no. 513) and the Mahabharata are supposed to be more explicit on this point. In the former text, the king of Kampilla, released from the man-eater, has been described as Moon released from the clutches of Rahu. On these grounds, Dr.Kern supposed that the story of Sutasoma originated from a nature-myth.

We are sorry to strike a dissentient note on this point.
It is clear that while the Brahmanical authors re-oriented the story to prove the supremacy of the first Varna, the Buddhists and the Jains adopted it for the propagation of their respective creeds. But in the earliest form of the legend, it had, we think, not only a historical or semihistorical background, but might even have some connexion with the story of the rape of Soma, as given in the Rgveda.� Many names of the Sutasoma-legend find explanation in Vedic thought, Further, the internal evidence of different

texts furnishes some details which run counter to the nature1 FVerspreide G�schriften, Vol. III, pp. 123, 146, 147.

myth theory of Dr. Kern. In Indian mythology, Rahu is doubtless described as a demon, but he does not possess two wings. In a large number of texts, a demon of such description captured Sutasoma.* Dr. Watanabe says? that this special form of the demon is rare in old Buddhist writings.
Besides, it is well-known to students of Sanskrit literature 'that a man coming out of danger is generally described by writers as Moon free from the clutches of Rahu. So the .Rahu-myth theory of Dr. Kern does not stand on a sure ground and different interpretations are possible. As regards Kalmasapada, our difficulties rather multiply than decrease.
It is noteworthy that in some of the oldest versions of the Sutasoma legend, the Older Samyuktavadana for example, the name of Kalmasapada does not occur and his place has been occupied by other persons. Apparently his name was introduced at a later period to explain the curse-motif or cannibalism of Saudasa. In the Nirukfa and the Sarognukramani, the name signifies the followers of Sudasa. in the older Chinese Avadanas and in the Pali Jatakas, the name is conspicuously absent. Dr. Watanabe suggests that they were compiled at a time when the name of Saudasa was not yet taken as an individual name of Kalmasapada." The latter name is, therefore, a late invention and as such, its etymological explanation cannot afford us any help in support of the above theory. As a matter of fact, we can add another etymological explanation to the two of Dr. Kern. The name of Kalmasapada may as well mean 'one partaining to the locality of Kalmasa.' When such diferent interpretations are possible, is it possible to be sure on the nature-myth origin of the story 2 Dr. Kern has apparently relied too much on metaphors and etymological explanations of names, which are not a sure guide

in such cases.

According to Dr. Friederich," the legend is based upon: the Ketakaparva. The author himself admits that the theme of his kakawin has been borrowed from a Baudhakavya. -As the story of Sutasoma is scattered in various texts

of Eastern Asia, it is not easy to identify the work mentioned by the poet. Evidently, the source of the OldJavanese recension cannot be derived from the Tibetan, Chinese or Japanese versions of the story, as the names of the Javanese text do not betray the influence of these places. The writer of this work was Mpu Tantular, who also.
may be credited with the authorship of the Arjunavijaya. Both these works mention Ranamangala (called Bhre Pandan Salas.
in the Pararaton), son of Sotor, who appears to be a great.
patron of the poet." It is clear, therefore, that these books were composed in the reign of Hayam Wuruk, also known as Bhatara Prabhu, Rajasanagara and Sang Hyang wekasing Sukha. The poem was popular in the island of Bali. Cod.
4526 of this work has been written in Balinese character with interlinear Balinese translation. Several cantos of the legend have been rendered into Balinese in the fragmentary Cod. 4527.

Let us now take up the kakawin Krsnayana. This work was composed in the reign of Varsajaya, whom we have identified with the well-known Javanese king Jayavarsa. An inscription of 1104 A. D. stands against the name of the latter. _ As a record of Kame#vara I has probably to be referred to 1116 A. D.�, the date furnished by the Wawatekan, viz., 1119 A. D., does not appear to be acceptable for this.

relation to king Varsajaya as the court-poet Kanva to Airlangga.*

The contents of this kakawin" relate to the love-affairs of Krsna and Rukmini. The latter was the princess of Kundina and daughter of Bhismaka and Prthukirtti, who had betrothed her to Jarasandha, the king of Cedi. According to the joint-testimony of the Visnupuranam*�" and the Harivam�am,* of which the latter offers a detailed account of the story the princess Rukmini was sought by Jarasandha not for himself but for Sigupala. The princess passionately loved Krsna, who foiled the proposed marriage by carrying off - Rukmini. Her brother Rukma and the mighty

Cedi king could ill brook the triumph of Krsna, whom they challenged to a fight. In the end both of them were worsted and, were it not for the timely intervention of Rukmini, her brother would have paid the penalty with his life for backing the Cedi king. Thus the longing couple 'were united in wedlock. The work also furnishes a list of the ten foremost wives of Krsna,-wives, whose number according to Indian and Javanese tradition is 16000. Towards the close of the book, the author bursts into a rapture over the gorgeous scenery of Dvaravati and narrates some erotic scenes which are hardly absent in any Kawi-work.

Four scenes from the Krsn@yana have been represented at the temple of Candi Jago." Similarly, the temple at Panataran not only preserves Ramayana reliefs, but also scenes from the above-mentioned kakawin, which we find

portrayed in the second terrace.�

Let us now turn from this work to the kakawin Kalayavanantaka, the main theme of which was known to Mpu Kanva in the beginning of the eleventh century A. D. Thus, we read in the Arjunavivdha :"In the battle-field was fallen the demon-king,

Destroyed by the Fire-arrow, with all his followers and vehicles,

Just as Kalayavana was onces reduced to ashes,

At the moment saze Mucakunda cursed (him)*."

Dr. Brandes says* that the legend reminds one of the beginning of the kakawin Harivam�a. We propose to study this Kawi-work now. Cod. 5095 of this poem runs into 34 cantos and they may be described? in the following manner : -It opens with the story of Visnu and the king of dragons (Uragendra), who incarnated themselves respectively in Ersna and Valadeva. Their object was to punish the demons who were vitiating the Prabhasatirtha. - After describing the fight between Krsna and Kansa, in which the latter was killed, the poet takes us to the five following songs (II-VI) which describe the grandeur of Dvaravati and Madhura (Mathura). The seventh canto introduces to us the demon Kalayavana, who resorted to hard austerities at Gokarna with the object of avenging the death of Kansa. His penances extorted the admiration of Bhairavi, who was pleased to make him invincible in war. Armed with this boon, he invaded Dviaravati and carried all before him. This mighty clash has been narrated in the following six cantos (VIII-XIID.
Krsna was aware of the boon of Bhairavi and, therefore, he had recourse to a stratagem to bring about the downfall of the monster. Pursued by Kalayavana, he entered into the hermitage of Mucakunda. The ascetic, who felt disturbed, scorched the hideous monster with the fire of his eyes. Thus the mission of Krsna and Valadeva was satisfactorily fulfilled. Towards the closing portion of the work, the

author describes how Subhadra eloped with Arjuna while the Andhakas and the Vrsnis were making festivities on the Raivata-hill. Though Valadeva first objected to this marriage, he gave his consent later on and the nuptial ceremony was duly performed with a display of Top�ng, expressed here by the term Raket. The work ends with, 'It kakawin Kalayavanantaka Krsnavijaya samapta.'

In the Koravag�grama,* the theme of the above poem has been succinctly summed up. It represents Kalayavana as Brahma's son, who used to devastate Dvaravati by eating up its inmates. The episode of Mucakunda also occurs here, but his name has been corrupted into Mrtyukunda. Among Sanskrit works, the story occurs in the Visnupuranam, * the Harivam�am," etc. Dr. Juynboll* held that the work was extant in Java in the thirteenth century A. D. just because the episode has been depicted in the reliefs of Candi Tumpang and Panataran. As popular traditions have an alternative claim, there is no reason why artists must follow the kakawin for the execution of their work. Provisionally, however, we accept the thirteenth century A. D. as the date of this kakawin.

Let us now take up the kakawin Ramavijaya," an OldJavanese work of sixty-three cantos. The poem offers an account of the disappointed lover Angaraparna (spelt as Angaparna), whose unreturned love flowed for Indra Renuka, the girl of his dream. In course of time she was married to Jamadagni, to whom she bore a son of the name of Paragurama.} Angaraparna, now blind with anger, devised means to wreck vengeance on Jamadagni with the help of Arjuna Sahasravahu. - Parafurama sought the help of Indra.

The story of the Churning of the Milk-sea is suggested in the sixth, thirty-second and thirty-third cantos of the present work, thus betraying the influence of the Mahabharata.?

Tentatively, we accept this kakawin as a work of the thirteenth century A. D.

A poem of the name of Prtuvzyaya (Prthuvijaya ?) stands against the name of a certain Astaguna. The name of the poet reminds one of the name of Triguna and Monaguna. The work handles the subject of the Brahmandapurana. Dr. Krom*� thinks provisionally that the work may be assigned to the Kediri period,. Similarly, the work Narakavijaya, which agrees with the earlier stories of the Bhomakavya, has to be referred to the reign of one Kamesvara. It is not clear if he should be identified with the first or the second king of that name.* Let us now take up the Bhomakavya�-a kakawin that has exerted

a pronounced influence on the history of Old-Javanese

literature and supplied materials to the stages of Indonesia.
According to Dr. Juynboll, the work Calon Arang, composed in 1462 Saka, has put the dialogue of Krsna and Narada of the Bhomakavya into the mouths of Airlangga and Bharadha.

The name of the book has been derived from Bhoma or

Bhauma, also known as Narakasura, His father was Visou and his mother was Prthivi or Earth. Through his mother's name, he also became famous as Mahisuta, Keitisuta, Mahija, Esitija, etc. His demoniac figure inspired the awe of all peoples and kings felt the weight of his arms. Indra, the king of gods, could not prevail against him and was compelled to seek shelter with Visnu. The latter gladly consented to kill the mighty demon, his son, in his incarnation of Krsna. Because, as he says himself in the Bhagavadgita', ''Whenever religion is in danger and sins are triumphant, I lose no time in re-incarnating myself." So Bhoma was killed by being lifted up from the earth, which could constantly re-invigorate him.

The work was written by Mpu Bradah, a Buddhist author. It is interesting to note that the subject handled by him has been borrowed from the Br�hmanical, and not the Buddhist, literature of India. Raffles� mentions a Javanese recension of the work under the name of Buma Kalatanaka or Embatali. It appears that the former name is a corruption of the Bomiantaka, which, when restored to its Sanskrit form, should correspond to Bhumantaka. The work has a Malay recension under the name of Hikaiat Sang Samba, which, however, differs on many points from the Kawirecension of Java". If the testimony of the Prastuti ning kakawin* has to be believed, the Bomantaka was composed

by Mpu Riserangan. If he is not the same writer as Mpu Bradah, Bomantaka should be a different work handling the same subject. Dr. Juynboll� has adduced no reason for

identifying these works. Winter� mentions two works, viz., Bomantara and Bomantaka, of which the first describes the

birth, and the second the death, of Boma {(i. e., Bhauma).

According to him, the author of the first work is Mpu: Kalangon and that of the second is Mpu Bodaguna. The Bhomakavya was doubtless very popular in the island of Bali, as appears from many Balinese translations of the poem.

The main subject of this poem occurs in different Sanskrit texts of India*, though the details are not identical in many cases. According to Dr. Kern, the Bhomakavya has to be dated after the Old-Javanese Ramayana, which he assigns to the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D. And accordingly, this work is placed by him in the fourteenth century A.D. Dr. Van der Tuuk�, however, assigns it to the reign of Kamegvara on the ground that the first verse of: the Bhomakavya runs as Mirtt Sang Hyang Manobha, which, we think, may not necessarily refer to KameSvara. As a working hypothesis, we may accept the date of Dr. Kern.

The work hitherto transcribed as Anggastyaparva�, should, according to Dr. Gonda,* be read as Agastyaparva. - It betrays the influence of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Niti and the cosmogonical literature of Ancient India.
There are some corrupt Sanskrit verses in the work, but their number, according to Dr. Pigeaud, is less than that of the Brahmandapurana. - The work opens in characteristic Pauranic way with a dialogue between Drddasyu (Drdhasyu) and his father Angghastya (Agastya). The former queried about the origin of the world and the latter narrated the incidents connected with the Mahapralaya (Great Destruction) when all beings perish excepting Bhatara Sadafgiva," who creates again.

Visnu has been traced to Caturbhita (viz., akaSa, vayu, prthivi - and tejas) and the egg. Brahma has been described as responsible for the creation of the Prajapatis, Sanaka, Nandana, Sanatkuma@ra, Bhyasa (Vyasa), Brahmargis, Manus and the Pitara(h). Drddasyu then questioned about the ten Brahmarsis, viz., Daksya (Daksa), Marici (Marici), Ruci, Nilalohita (Nila), Bhrgu, Atri, Angira, Pulaha, Kratu and Vafgista (Vafistha). This list appears to have been confused both in Java as well as India, because, neither the names nor their arrangements are identical in all works.* The creation of Marici from Brahma's eye naturally reminds one of a similar description in the: Manusamhita."* The author then traces the origin of the fourteen Manus to the Brahmarsis. Lach of these Manus, as the writer tells us, remained for seventy-one yugas." Drddasyu then sought information regarding the descendants of Daksya and was informed that the latter begot fiftyone daughters through his wife Prasuti, and thirteen: of them were married to Prajapati. - The author then gives some details regarding the issue of - these thirteen daughters. Others, as the author tells us, were married to the brothers of Daksya. Thus, Nilalohita was married to Sati (Sati), Bhrgu to Kyati (Khyati), Angra to Smut (Smrti), Pulastya to Priti (Priti), Pulaha to to Ksyama (Ksama), Kratu to Sanati (Sannati), Atri to Anasuya (Anastya), Vafista to Urjja (Urjja), Agni to Svaha (Svaha) and Pitr to Svada (Svadha).

of Urjjia has similarly been spelt as Urjja. In the Markandeyapuranam," again, Urjja is Atri's wife and AnasGiya is Vagistha's. Itis noteworthy that the Javanese author has not given above the name of the wife of Marici, though he has already mentioned him as one of the brothers of Daksya.
From Indian literature, we can supply her name as Sambhiti.
It is also noteworthy that some new names appear in the second list, while some others drop out from the first.

Daksya also married Asiktiki and had by her ten daughters, who were married to Dharma." Their children were Dagavi�va and Astabhasu (�vasu).* The 27 Anaksatras (naksatras) who were married with the Moon were also the issue of Daksya and Asiktiki.� Drddasyu then turned to a differergt topic and requested his father to describe how men came to hell and heaven. He was told that this was due to Ulah, Sabda and Ambeka, of which Ulah is the lowest and Ambeka is the highest virtue. it is stated further that for manasik (manasik) sins, men become plants ; for vacika (vacika) sins, animals ; for Rkayika (kayika) sins, Mleca (Mleccha) The Manusamhita gives a slightly different version of it." The author remarks that redemption from the last is very difficult.

The author then proceeds with his story and describes that the blindness of men is due to their making sins with their eyes and also to their deriving pleasure from

bad things. Similarly, the dumb spoke black things about the good; the deaf heard disgraceful speeches; and the diseased committed sins by agamyagamana, viz., impurity, theft, falsehood, etc. The theme is spun further and the author tells us that the atma (@tman) is carried to heaven or hell by the ativahita-body. - In the heaven, this receives divyagarira ; in the hell, this is punished by Dharma according to the sin committed in earlier life. The god of Death also decides where he is to be born again. The writer informs us further that three works enable one to reach heaven, viz., tapas, yajfia and kirti (kirtti). These three have been described as pravrttidharma, while yoga has been called nivritidharma. Five kinds of yajfias, viz., deva-, rsi-, pitr~, bhita and manusa (manusya) yajfias, have also been enumerated.* The author says that after the term of the deceased in heaven is over he is again �born on the earth.
All these show belief in the transmigration of souls and conviction that the conduct of the present life determine the status of the future.

The work also furnishes some details regarding religion and connected topics. It is said that if anyone conducts worship without frankincense, he becomes happy only for a moment but then remains unhappy ever afterwards. Similarly, if anyone despises or turns back from the poor and the helpless, he may become rich and eminent in life, but he is never loved by anybody. If the worship is conducted faultily, the author tells us, the worshipper may be rich, but he must be born among the low. Similarly, if anyone follows the injunctions of religion in a bad spirit, he be1 In the Manusumhita, Chap.

comes a beautiful Candala ! If anyone has mania for purifying himself always,} he is born ugly in a high family.

Genealogical details again take their due course. It is stated that thirteen daughters of Daksya were married to Kasyapa (Kagyapa) and of them, Aditi became the mother of twelve children. Drddasyu asked why Aditi conceived gods as her children and was answered that this was due to her mild temper and her absence of upeksa (upeksa).
The writer then passes on to the story of Kasyapa and Diti, who became the parents of Hiranyakasipu, Hiranyaksa and Singhika, the mother of Rahu. Some space is also devoted to the description of the four sons of Hiranyakasipu and their descendants. The genealogy of Vairocana, the son of Prahlada, has also been narrated.*

The author then tells us that Indra, after killing Maruta or the Wind-god, went to heaven to remove his sins of Brahmahatya (�hatya) or Bhrunaha(tya).� The writer then explains what is meant by Bhrunaha. After furnishing some details of the genealogy of Prahlada, Hiranyakasipu, Nivatrakavaca and others, the work narrates some incidents, which we find in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In the reference to Manimantaka, Arjuna, Nivatakavaca, Muka who became the boar Damalung, we apparently notice the influence of the Arjunavivaha or the Viv@ha-kawi.
Similarly, through the mention of Tataka (Tadaka), who was killed by Rama, and Marica (Marica), who captivated Sita (Sita), we infer the influence of the Ramayana. The Mahkhabharata-story of Sunda and Upasunda has also been noted here. Even the story of Nahusa, who is stated to have been carried by the Devarsis and cursed by Anggastya

(Agastya) has not been omitted. The author once more reverts to the Ramayana and refers to the crow Jayanta when Ramasita (Rama-Sita) concealed themselves in the Paficavadi (�vati).

The Danavas have been described as the children of Kasyapa and Danu. Yama, the father of Mandondari {Mandodari) and the father-in-law of Ravana, was one of them. The author then narrates the story of Ke�gi (Kesi), who was killed by Krsna and Valadeva at Madura '(Mathura.)*. War-scenes continue and we find Hayagriva (@'griva) fighting against Krsna. The demon Dundu followed suit and he was killed by Maharaja Kulava�va (Kuvalaya�va ?). - Drddasyu then asked why Prava, the wife of Kasyapa, got Gandharva children. He was informed that this was due to her artistic temperament. Similarly, one thousand naga-sons of Kadry and Kasyapa have been attributed to the nature of the former. The reference to Vinatha (Vinata), Arjuna and Garuda, which occurs in this connexion, undoubtedly suggests the influence of 'the Mahabharata. The story of Mali and Sumali, occurring in the Old-Javanese Harigraya, has also been noted here.

The author further recalls how Madu (Madhu) was killed by Visnu.? The story of Lavanasura, who held sway over Madura (Madhupura), was borrowed, as the author candidly says, from the Ramayana-carita. The Uttarakanda of the Ramayana* indeed narrates how the demon was killed by Satrughna. The author, however, reverts to his favourite themes of the Mahabharata and describes how the gods and the demons churned the Milk-sea with Mount Mandara. The author then indulges in philosophical speculations and says that one who cannot overcome

Sadvarga must exercise Trikaya paramartha, viz., Rkayika,

vacika and manasik, i. e., recitation of mantras, purity in words and in thoughts. After a brief notice of Jatayu and Ira, Pulastya and their issue,* the author introduces us to deeper philosophical speculations. Thus, asked about the aim of Paragurama, Angghastya replied that the object of the former was to attain the one-ness of Tripuruga, which has been described as the highest of the sixteen tattvas | Poor Samkhya philosophy | Of the names that next meet our eyes, the most interesting are those of Bheravamargga - (Bhairavamarga), - Sidanta-Seva-Pasupata (Siddhanta-Saiva-Pajdupata), - Yogadiparamaguhya, - Vesnavapaksa (Vaisnava') and Niskalaparama-Sunya - (NisSome of these names evidently suggest the influence of Saiva Tantrism. The author adds further that if anyone cannot separate manah from �faritra and is a slave to the Sadvarga, he cannot attain Kamoksana, i.e., salvation. The writer thus recognises the existence of a spiritual life, which is in sharp contrast to the physical one.

Angghastya stated further that the performance of three vpratas, viz., akrodha, alobha and enabled one

to become a devata or god. But as these were not humanly possible, the speaker recommended that sembah should be conveyed to the Panditas, i.e., the Brahmanas and, at the same time, one should take initiation from Pratama (�thama), Madyama (�(dhyama) and u(i)tamaguru. The \guru gives him mantras and instructs him in the philosophy of the Lord. And thus, redemption is attained. The author notes, however, that instruction before initiation is equivalent to Brahmahatya on the part of the guru.
Genealogical details again take their due course and we obtain some data regarding the families of Angira, Hanuman, Krpa, Drona, Kunti, Pulastya and Va�istha.
Bhysa (Vyasa) has been described as the author of the Astadagaparvoa. The author then narrates the little anecdote ?of Aditya, who followed Ajfia (Sajfia) to U(t)tarakuru,

Sanskrit Puranas indeed narrate how Sajfia, unable to bear the brilliance of the Sun, went to perform penances after sending a pseudo-Sajma, called Chaya, to her husband.
Towards the end of the work, the author speaks of the four varnas and their dharma and he classifies the Candalas and Dombas under the Sudras ; the Mlecas (Mlecchas) have been described as foreign to the caturvarna. The book also refers to varnasarikara or mixture of castes, which was looked upon with particular aversion by the Javanese peoples.

The work is evidently based on various traditions of Indian mythology, which filtered through the colonists from India or the Javanese visitors of the mainland in the IndoJavanese period. Indigenous traces are not altogether absent in the work. Dr. Pigeaud� thinl?s that the Agastya~ parva is older than the Korava�rama, which we have already placed in the fourteenth century A. D.

The two Middle-Javanese poems, viz., Sudamala and Sri Tafijung, of which the former may be regarded as an introduction to the latter, are also of some importance. Of the Sudamala, Dr. Van der Tuuk says," "The poem relates

how Sahadeva delivered Durga of her Raksasa-form, the

consequence of a curse by Siva, who had convicted her of adultery with a young cowherd, and had assumed that form to put her to the test. Uma, being transformed into a monster, received the name of Durga, and was compelled to dwell in the cemetery Gandamayu. Sahadeva delivered her of the consequence of Siva's curse, and went thenceforth by the name of Sudamala, -a corruption from Suddha (purified), and mala (a temporary monstrous form caused by the curse of a god)." On the advice of Durga, SudamalaSahadeva went to Tambapetra and, after curing him of his blindness, married his daughter. - The two vidyadharas, viz., Citrasena and Citrangada, who were cursed to assume

Raksasa-forms along with Uma, fought against the Pandavas and were killed by them. They then recovered their original beautiful form." ._ This Sahadeva-continues the Sri Tafijung-had a beautiful daughter, who is the title-heroine. She was married to Sidapaksa, her cousin, the son of Nakula. "He stabs her under the impression that she had committed adultery during his absence in Indra's heaven whither the king had sent him in order to seduce Sri Tafijung. From the circumstance of her blood emitting a delicious scent he concluded that the king had slandered her...... The wicked king, Sinduraja, is at last killed by Sidapaksa, who is assisted by the There are some other stories of this character, which, while borrowing the names of persons from the two great epics of India, have placed them against an original background.
ta. - The Arjuna Pralabda,3 for example, presents Arjuna and his brothers in the main role. The names of Krsna, Haladhara and Siva are also met with. But we shall seek in vain for the parallel of this story in Sanskrit literature. Of a $ 3 similar nature is the story of Darmajati,* in which we come across the names of Duryodhana who wanted to poison Bhima, of Subhadra, Krsna, Arjuna, Suprabha and others.
In this poem, Subhadra appears as Krsna's daughter ! The 44+ Sang Satyavan' is a Middle-Javanese poem, written in Macapat metre. The wife of Satyavan (Satyavan) is Suvistri (Savitri), who has been described as the daughter of Yayati and Devayani. From the names of the hero and the heroine, one may conjecture that the story is no other than the well-known story of Savitri and Satyavan, which we find scattered in many works of Ancient India.

mixed up ; Javanese traces are not also lacking." Similarly, in the work called Calon Arang," not only magicism and Indian deities are present, but also the well-known story of Supratika and Vibhavasu, who fought in the disguise of an elephant and a tortoise. The latter two were killed by Garuda by the orders of Kasyapa. This episode has clearly been borrowed from the Adiparvan of the Mahabharata.

We thus come to the end of our studies on this section of _ the Indo-Javanese literature. There are indeed few books in Java and Bali, which do not betray any Indian influence.
Clear traces can be found even in the so-called Muslim literature of Java. Indeed, the influence is sometimes so great that we have to consider seriously whether this is a

Muslim influence on Hindu literature or vice-versa. - It is the invocation of the writer that sometimes guides us in our

decision on this point. As the discussion of Muslim literature is beyond the scope of the present work, we may rest content with what we have said above.

CHAPTER XV

LEGENDS AND ROMANCES OF JAVA AND BALI

The peoples of Java and Bali are extremely fond of legends and romances, which illustrate the imaginative aspect of the Indonesian mind. The study of the subject has, therefore, not only an educative value for understanding the people, but is also instructive from the strict folklorists' point of view. Itis possible that the demands of popular temperament fashioned this literature, which had also some reciprocal influence on the former. The study of the subject, however, is fraught with some difficulties due to parallelism in ideas and folk-tales, as, in such cases, it is well-nigh impossible to disentangle the forces of mutual influence and trace the stories to their sources. Dr. Franz Boas has sought to explain this similarity in folk-tales by the theory of '"'Parallelism of culture development'. It postulates that "'different groups of mankind started, at a very early period, from a general condition of lack of culture, and, owing to the unity of the human mind and the consequent similar response to outer and inner stimuli, they have developed everywhere approximately along the same lines, making - similar inventions and developing similar customs and beliefs-"'. The above statements do not require any qualification when applied to widely separated groups of peoples, but when cultural contacts are known to have existed, these legends and romances baffle all our attempts for the discovery of their sources. In the following pages we shall have occasion to discuss not only parallel but also identical stories. The links that, in our opinion, connect the legends and romances of Indo-Mail-Polynesia are the following :(a) Love-episodes at the bathing-ghat.

(b) Dream of the hero and the heroine for each other

% �

before "the fancy'"' was actually "bred in the eye.

(c) Curse-motif.

(d) Talks of wise parrots, wily jackals, etc., who frequently guide the heroes and heroines. These are not uncommon - features of Indo-Mal-Polynesian - legends.
Peacocks also play a prominent part in Malay folk-tales.

(e) Raksasas, goblins and old hags expert in black arts.
These occur in profusion in Indo-Mal-Polynesian folk-tales.
Many Indian folk-tales, particularly those of - Bengal, describe how the lives of Raksasas are kept in some magic boxes, trees or animals. We may recall in this connexion the stories of Dalimkumar, of the Raksasas, of the boy whom seven mothers suckled, which have been described in the Folk-tales of Bengal, compiled by the late Rev. Lal Behari De. The Arjunavivdha also tells us haw the demon-king could not be killed unless he was struck in the tongue. In the Kathasaritsagarah," similarly, we find the demon saying, 'In my left hand there is an unguarded place," where lay the magic of his power. In romantic literature, however, fairies, gandharvas, apsaras, play a more prominent rdle.

Let us illustrate these points from the literature of India and Indonesia. - In the Sanskrit Mahabharata," for example, the poet describes how the A�vin-twins fell in love with the young girl Sukanya just as she was coming out from her bath. Numerous examples can be culled from the Katha saritsagarah of Somadeva, but we shall rest content with a

. few specific instances. The case of Kirtisena" is a typical

one. He fell in love with Srutartha as she was going to bathe and married her by the Gandharva-rite. Similarly, the Yaksa Sata beheld the daughter of a sage bathing in the Ganges and both of them became enamoured of each other.

341 LEGENDS AND ROMANCES

Somadeva' also describes how the vidyadharas, viz., Vijayadatta and Afokadatta saw daughters of hermits bathing in the Ganges and how they fell in love with them and how the love was returned. In the story of Candrahasa and Visaya, which occurs in the Bengali Mahabharata� and which, according to Dr. D. C. Sen," is a distinct Bengali interpolation, the love of Visaya originated in seeing the sleeping Candrahasa at the bathing-ghat and it was fruitful in marriage. Love-episodes at the bathing-ghat have also played a prominent part in the writings of the Vaisnava poets of Bengal. One of them, for example, wrote the following beautiful verses :''Sai, ki herilam Yamuniar kule Vrajakula-nandana harila amar mana Tribhanga darana tarumile."

["Ah, friend ! What met my eyes on the banks of the Yamuna |_ The darling of the Vraja-people, standing crosslegged under a tree, captured my heart."] The amours of Pauranic Krsna in the bathing-ghits are too well-known to need any re-capitulation. The courtesy, however, was not always paid back. In the Kathasaritsagarah,* for example, we read the story of four ganas, who fell in love with a

bathing hermit's daughter, but the love was not returned.
Let us now trace these features in the romances of Java 'and Bali. The Middle-Javanese poem Durma,' which may 'be brought under this category, enjoys some popularity in Indonesia. The occurrence of some Balinese words in the body of the book (Cod. 4225) betrays the influence of Bali. According to Dr. Juynboll.' the story begins with a Mal-Polynesian myth,. It describes how the clothes of the

bathing vidyadhari, Ken Sulasih, were concealed by Rajapala, who ultimately confessed his love to the nymph. It reminds us of the tricks of Pauranic Krsna, who used to pick up the dresses of bathing ladies and climb along with them on some neighbouring tree. The vidyadhari, however, yielded to her importunate lover and both were united in wed-lock. In course of time, Durma, the hero of the poem, was born to them and Ken Sulasih, like many other celestial nymphs, vanished to heaven, her original abode. We have already described the Kawi-work Sumanasantaka, which bears this trait. More typical, however, is the story of Purfrava and.
Urva�i,' of whom the latter vanished, to heaven after the episode of a son was introduced. The reason is explicitly stated by Madanavega in the Kathasaritsagarah," "'Kalingasena, we heavenly beings are subject to this law, that, when a mortal child is conceived, we must abandon it, and go afar.
Did not Menaka leave Sakuntala in the hermitage of Kanva ?" This Durma, along with his father Rajapala, went to perform penances, and the latter instructed him in moral lessons.
Dr. Juynboll� points out that these conversations are conducted in Balinese. Later on, Durma, intending to go to the king of Wanokling was abducted by the raksasi Durgadeni (Durgandhini?) accompanied by her two brothers. At length, he succeeded in escaping from their clutches and killing them all. As a reward for his valour, he obtained the title of Raden Singa Pafijara.

Though the earlier portion of the poem under review belongs to the Mal-Polynesian group of legends (Juynboll), it is better to designate such stories as Indo-Mal-Polynesian because thess peculiar traits are common to the romantic

literature of all these lands. Similar is the tenor of the poem Raden Saputra or Ratna-Manik', which has not only a Balinese recension but also East-Javanese and Madurese recensions. The Balinese recension, however, is in sharp contrast to the Madurese Radin Sapotra (Cod. 3153) described by Prof. Vreede. It also differs, and differs surprisingly, from Cod. 4962 (2), summarised by Dr. Juynboll in his Supplement, vol. I. We take up the Balinese recension, which is exceedingly suitable for our present purpose.
The contents of this poem, written in Macapat metre, may be described in the following manner.

The hero of the poem is Raden Saputra. He began his chivalrous career by fighting against tigers. On one occasion, he entered a yard, which, as the story says, was haunted by ghosts and wild spirits, and his entrance there was regarded by them as amounting to trespass. He unsheathed his sword and began to fight vehemently against the spirits of the air. There he fell asleep and the beautiful form of his beloved Devi Ratna Manik bloomed in his vision. The latter, in her turn, was also dreaming of our young hero. Ultimately, Raden Saputra saw her as she was bathing and the episode happily ended in a decent nuptial ceremony.

In the poem Ajar Pikatan' winch belongs to the Panj cycle, the same characteristic - is brought into prominence.
Ajar Pikatan, who is the hero of the poem and son of queen Pandan Salas, while going out on a hunting excursion, was separated from his retinue. While moving about in the garden of Pandan Ukir, he saw the vidyadhar Suprabha bathing and, like Rajapala, he concealed her sisimping.
At last she got it back and after giving a ring to the young

hero the vidyadhari vanished from his sight. Ajar Pikatan, like other heroes of romances, travelled many lands in

search of his beloved and married other damsels as well, but his heart was too captivated by Suprabha to bear the company of his newly-married brides. At length he was informed by the bird Gantayu (Skt. Jatayu) that Suprabh&a was in surdlaya or heaven. Though Cod. 4010 (1) of this work, upon which we rely, is not complete, it appears from the drift of the poem that they were united in the long run.

We shall close our survey of this subject with a brief review of the poem called Pafiji Margasmara.' It begins with the story of Candrasari, princess of Singa Sekar, who once saw the patih of Majalangu, named Pafiji Margasmara, bathing and spontaneously she fell in love with him. The poet describes in the third canto how her love was returned by the young hero. After many difficulties, he succeeded in obtaining her and a daughter was born to them (cantos IX-XIX).

A series of written and unwritten romances of this type are current in South-East Asia and a mistaken notion of what constitutes culture and science is throwing many such legends into eternal oblivion.

Let us now take up the second point which we may conveniently designate 'the dream-motif' in - romantic literature. In the stories of Indo-Mail-Polynesia, this trait has acquired more importance than the fore-going one.
Among classical works of Ancient India, we find this characteristic marvellously portrayed in the Vasavadatta of Subandhu, in which we find Kandarpaketu, son of king �Cintamani, dreaming towards dawn, when true dreams come, of a girl of eighteen of exquisite form. Like Pafiji he went in search of the maiden and, while passing a restless night on the Vindhya Mountain, he gathered from the talk of a mainabird that Vasavadatta was the only daughter of Smgara~

gekhara, king of Pataliputra. The princess also, like Ratna

344 LECENDS AND ROMANCES

Manik and other heroines of Indonesia, dreamt of a stalwart knight of exceptional beauty and, though there was no.
Gangaspati, she had her confidant Tamalika, who united the two lovers at Pataliputra. Similarly, in the Svapnavasavadaita,' attributed to Bhasa, we find the story of Vatsaraja,.
who drearat of his beloved Vasavadatta, while asleep. In the Kathasaritsagarah of Somadeva, we find numerous stories of this type. We can describe only a typical case, in the language of Somadeva :* "" Ther she (Usa) saw in a dream a certain man looking like a divine prince. She - was married to him according to the Gandharva form of marriage, and after obtaining the joy of union with him, she woke up at the close of the night. When she did not.
see the husband she had seen in her dream, but beheld the traces of his presence, she remembered the book of Gauri, and was full of disquietude, fear and astonishment ...... she confessed all to her friend Citralekha'" who asked Usa to find out her lover from "the whole world, gods, asuras and men." This story also occurs in the Visnupuranam.� - Similar dream-motifs have controlled the movements of heroes and heroines in the first Act of the Viddhaf@labhafijika and in the third Act of the Karpiiramafijari, both of which have been written by Rajagekhara. Many such romances are current in the Deccan, the Pafijjab, Bengal and other places of India.
Some are recorded in the Old Deccan Days of Frere, Legends of the Pafijab of Temple, Folk-tales of Hindusthan of Crooke and in stories compiled by Mr. D. R. MitraMajumdar in his Thakurmar Jhuli and Thakurdadar Jhola.
Thus we read of :

l '"Kucavaran rajakanya, meghavaran cul

Svapne dekhilam ami kon defer phul"'

[''The princess has as beautiful a complexion as that

of a Kuca-seed and her hair matches the colour of clouds t

Oh, tell me, of which country the flower bloomed in my dream."]

Bengali heroes and heroines sometimes roam like Pafji and Amahi-raras throughout the length and the breadth of the wide world for discovering the lovers of their dreams.
Frequently, the desperate lovers, like those of the Arabian Nights, are united by some mischievous fairies onl?
to be separated later on. This unaccountable separation breaks the heart of many and if they do not take to ascetieism one of them frequently falls ill. The other or one of his friends occasionally comes in as a doctor to cure the disease, which is removed by his or her presence or the news of the other lover.' Sometimes we find that even the mere description of an exquisite princess makes a Bengali hero undertake the journey to unknown and untraversed regions.
When the hiramon-bird," for example, ,said to the six queens of the king, ''The beauty of not one of you can be compared to the beauty of the little toe of the lady that lives beyond the seven oceans and thirteen rivers," the king desirous of possessing this paragon of beauty harnessed his horse, which "shot through the air with the speed of lightning, passed over many countries, kingdoms and empires,.
crossed the oceans and thirteen rivers and alighted in the evening at the gate of a beautiful palace." No rein was put to the imagination of the poet which soared as high as the magic steed of the king.

In the legends and romances of Indonesia, the dreammotif has also assumed considerable importance. Thus we read of a princess of Rum, who "dreams that she slept with Pafiji, and waking up is much distressed and dies." So far as we are aware, there are not many

stories in India with such pathetic conclusion. In the story called Pafiji Jaya Lengkara,* we read of one Bambang . Sutirta, who, in his dream, fell in love with Sekar Taji or Candra Kirana, princess of Mamenang (Kediri), beloved of Pafji. Similarly, Devi Pandan Sari and Devi Manik Ara, in the romance of Angling Darma," saw their lovers in dream. Even demons have not escaped from the sweep of love, which took form in their sleep. Thus in the story called Lampahan Srikandi guguru manah," we find the demon-king of Parang Jong Lauttan, Mraja Ditya Kalamurka by name, being fascinated by the beauty of Srikandi even in dream! - In the romance of Jaka Prataka� and the Chinese princess Cuviri, the same factor has also controlled their love-adventures. In a Sundanese prose-work, called Carita . Panggung Mantri,� the king of Gunung Sungging, Prabu . Bengker Pakuvan by name, sent his Mantri to find out the princess of Gunung Bubut, named Ratna Pakuvan, as she had ensnared him in dream ! This motif has also penetrated into the so-called Muslim literature of Java. In the poem called Kampar,� written in Macapat metre, princess Retna Jinali of Bragedab (Bagdad) dreamt of a beautiful youth, who was no other than Ambya Katamsi. After converting her to Islam, the latter married the girl in due course. Similarly, in the work called Anbya Jusuf,' we read of one Kusuma Siti Jaleka, the beautiful daughter of the Sultan of Temas, who dreamt of her would-be husband living in Egypt. This dream-motif has also exercised some influence on the literature of Madura. In the poem called Suksma Jati,' Devi Ruherat dreamt of a handsome knight, who later on appeared to be Suksma Jati, hailing from Jasmane. After some romantic adventures, they were united in marriage.

It is clear therefore that this dream-motif has exercised a -great influence on the romantic literature of Indo-MalPolynesia. - Portraits have their toll also. In Sanskrit literature, we read of Agnimitra who fell in love with Malavika just after seeing her portrait The courtesy was returned by a member of the opposite sex, viz.,

princess Rupalata of Mukti, who was fascinated by �a sketch of Prthividhara.' But this point, we believe, did not assume importance in the early romantic literature of South-East Asia. In the Pafiji romances again we face a different motif, with the heroine vanishing from her palace. Adventures of heroes are necessarily introduced to spin out the thread of the story. This trait is also present in the romances of Ancient India and of Medieval Europe. In spite of the closer contact of Asia and Europe in the days of the crusades,� it would not be wise perhaps to accept this characteristic as a connecting link of the romances of the two continents. The unity of the human mind between and the obvious necessity of such traits in the romances of all lands are perhaps responsible for their evolution,. As regards the cursemotif, responsible authorities hold it to be a distinct contribution of the Epic and the Pauranic literature of India and there is no reason to strike a different note.
Two sages of old, viz., Durvasa and Vi�vamitra have liberally cursed many persons, thus enabling Brahmana editors and writers to proclaim the supremacy of the priestly hierarchy. - This has naturally led to the growth of some beautiful legends which we find scattered in many works of Ancient India. We have already described some kawi-works which betray this characteristic. This trait was probably borrowed in different romantic cycles

of Indonesia through the earliet works of Java and Bali, which represented the influence of ancient Indian literature. - Taking disguises of various men, beasts, demons, etc., may be due to faith in magicism and superstitions, and as such, this peculiarity, though present in the literature of India and Indonesia, may not be taken as a connecting link between the legends and romances of South-East Asia. Other traits, which we have mentioned befere, will be treated in the next chapter.

Among the stories of Java and Bali none are more popular than the Pafiji-romances, which we may describe now. - Pafiji is the hero of these poems, which deal with different phases of Pafji's life, such as, his love to the heroine, the loss of his consort, her transformation to a man.
and so forth, Of the many Middle-Javanese Pafiji-poems in Tengahan-metre, Malat appears to be the most important.

the heroes and heroines occurring in them, they resemble

more the Malay tales belonging to the Pafiji-cycles than

the modern Javanese poems treating of the same subject."" As these works are of the same character, we shall begin our review with an account of the Waseng," which has also been written in Tengahan metre.

As she was the most accomplished beauty of all lands, her hand was asked in marriage by the king of Magadha. Perceiving that Wiranamatami lay in the way of his desires, the king of Magadha had recourse to a trick, by which he succeeded in kidnapping: the sleeping prince of Kling and sending him to Magadha.
As he was invulnerable, he was thrown into water. where he remained for ten days without dying. The surging

waves cast him ashore, and he was discovered there by the princess of Kediri. He now stayed on to Kedini under the assumed name of Hundakan Wasengsari and lived "in the vicinity of the beloved one, who was not aware -of his being the prince of Koripan.' In song II is stated how the kings of Magadha, Putrasena and Pawon-awon, marched against Daha (Kediri) to take away forcibly the princess of Kediri. Waseng thus found an opportunity to show his gratitude by killing these kings, who were his former enemies. After this, the poet introduces us to the : two lovers again, Waseng and Amahi-raras, who passionately loved each other. We read in song II! that their marriage proposal could not substantiate on account of the sudden invasion of the king of Wirabhumi, who fell on Daha. During the confusion of the war, Amahi-raras vanished, Waseng, who was away during the turmoils ofthe war, fell into a swoon when he heard of the fate of his beloved. In the following song, however, we find Amahi-raras seeking shelter with a monk. In his hermitage she came across the king .of Geglang, who gave protection to the unfortunate girl. She assumed the name of Amahilara to befit her present position.
Meanwhile, Waseng had been out to discover the princess of Daha and overthrew kings and kingdoms in his progress from country to country under the pseudo-name of Pafiji Tamasah. He married the daughters of the overthrown kings. The hand of Amahilara was also promised to him by the king of Geglang as a reward for his unparalleled chivalry (cantos V and VI). On one occasion, whil� Amahilara was singing favourite songs she used to sing in Daha, the notes seemed familiar to Pafiji Tamasah, who fell into a swoon. Pafiji became seriously ill and in remorse, Amahilara wanted to commit suicide. The tragedy was, however, averted by the timely arrival of the king of Daha, who discovered that Waseng and Pafiji Tamasah were one and the same and that Amahilara is no other than his own lost daughter. The liveliness of reconciliation was further increased by the leakage of the information that Waseng, again, was no other than Wiranamatami, the prince of

and the birth of a son.

The Wangbong Wideha also belongs to the Pafiji-cycle of stories and is no less popular than the Waseng. It describes' how Makaradhvaja went in search of the banished princess of Daha named Warastrasari. - In his aimless travels throughout many lands he came across the lovely princess of Singhasari named Kefavati, whom he married. But he never forgot for a moment the beautiful lady of Daha whom he wanted to discover at any cost. Meanwhile, Warastrasari was roving in the woods of Kembang Kuning, where she was found by the prince of that kingdom, named Singamiatra. He kindly led her to Daha again and married her, though her heart was already sealed in love for Makaradhvaja | When Makaradhvaja was informed of all these affairs he assumed the name of Wangbong Wideha Pafiji Wires�vara and went to Daha, where he became a dalang* and showed some - shadow-plays, of which Ghatotkacasraya was one. In these plays, the princess used to come and she was gradually attracted by the magnificent bearing of the dalang and his expert handling of the shadow plays. They fell in love with each other. The last two Songs (II and III) state how the king of Daha was hard pressed by the kings of Lasem and others, and how he was relieved by Wanghbong Wideha who slew four kings of the invading hosts. At length he escorted Warastrasari to.
Koripan where he married her in due course. - The disappointed prince Singamiatra who loved the princess of Daha now married the princess of Lasem. This is the subject-matter of the Wangbong Wideha. The poems belonging to the Pafiji-cycle of stories, though beautiful in their own way, do not represent an unflinching devotion of the one for the other.

The Smarawedana is also of some importarcs and it runs into eighteen cantos, The beginning of the story reminds

one of the Bengali folk-tales of a certain ape-prince, who used to cast of his monkey-disguise by night. The wife of this ape was also a princess, who, discovering it on one occasion, availed the very first opportunity of destroying it by the fire. People were amazed to find next morning that the ape was the most beautiful prince on earth. This story, though materially differing from the remaining portion of the Smarawedana, is very much popular in Bengal. It may be noted in this connexion that the kernel of this story also reminds one of the Sundanese Siyung Wanara, the Lutung Kasarung legends and the Sasak version of the Tutur Monjeh." If it is not of Austric origin, the story may have proceeded from Bengal.

The Javanese story of the Smarawedana runs as follows :The first canto of the book informs us that a white ape" was born to the king of Janggala (Koripan) and he was ultimately banished from the country, This incident almost synchronized with the disappearance of Suksmasari, the princess of Daha. On one occasion, while she was passing her time in a garden, she saw a glittering object and, as she pursued it, it faded further and further. No one knew whither she had gone. An array of knights began to search all possible and impossible quarters and Citradana, the

The second canto opens with the arrival of the monkeyprince of Janggala at the court of Pandan Salas, who wanted 'to make him his son-in-law. Bereft of his ape-disguise at the time of bathing, he appeared as a full-fledged prince and married both the daughters of the king, viz., Amrtamaya and Krtamaya. Songs II-VI refer to the kings who were either killed or defeated by Wiratmaka, the name now assumed by the prince of Janggala. The daughters of these kings were married by him. He again assumed the name of Smarawedana and married Mrtaningrat, the princess of

: Geglang (canto IX). Fights and marriages of other knights are described in Songs X-XIlI, while a vivid description of marriage-feasts is given in cantos XIV and XV. The following Song (XVI) informs us that the king of Janggala (Koripan) sent a message to Geglang stating his intention to take to asceticism for getting a son. The messenger learnt that Wiratmaka was the prince of Janggala and there was no reason why the king should resort to penances. Meanwhile, Wiratmaka eloped from Geglang with Antasari (Song XVII), whereupon the king of that dominion sent Rudrakara and Sudanamrta to Pranaraga with instructions to kill Wiratmaka and bring back the princess. The king of Koripan appeared at the right moment and the melancholy tone of the story is relieved by the description of marriageceremony (Song XVIII).

The Mantri Wadak*, Menur Wilis� and the Misa Gagang fall under the same category. The first work is of very modern date and many Balinese words have penetrated into it. In recent years the researches of Dr. Poerbatjaraka and Dr. Rassers have brought the problems of the

GH. XVI LEGENDS AND ROMANCES 353

Pafiji-romances into the forefront and some of them we have sought to discuss above. The cycle is the product of many generations and much exotic element has been mixed up with it. From the various names and pseudo-names of the hero and the heroine, such as Rawi-sarangga, Candrakirana, Candrasari, Nawang Wulan, one may conjecture that the ultimate source of the Pafiji-romance is the Sun am the Moon-myth. It is possible that in its earliest form the legend was purely a Moon-myth which was gradually mixed up with an exotic Sun-myth.' A strong sexual drift was introduced into the romance by the latter, Thus Pafji, seeking his beloved Candrakirana, is just like the Sun, which, according to Mythology, riding on his seven - horses, ever pursues the vanishing Moon. One special feature is 'that both the main players of the romance were born just on the fourteenth, when the full-Moon graced the nocturnal sky.
When Indra Kamajaya and his sister Nila Keficana, for example, were born, it thundered, mild wind blew, the rainbow appeared in the sky, flowers scattered their odour, the Moon suffered an eclipse and, in the morning, the two babies were born as beautiful as the Sun and the Moon." Such �descriptions recur in many places of the Pafiji-romances.

If the above statements are accepted, we must admit "/

that the pure Indonesian form of many of these stories was mixed up with foreign elements in course of time. Not only over-sea kings, including those of Golconda, Tanjore, Gujrat, Bengal, etc.,* are referred to in many places, but vivid descriptions of Svayamuvaras are given here and there. In the Cekelwanengpati occurs the Svayamuvaras of Candrakirana and this is conditioned by her obtaining a gold-horned - deer, which betrays the influence of the Ramayana. The names of Arend Jantaju and Kelana Wira Nonoman are clearly borrowed from the well-known Sanskrit names of the bird Jatayu and Hanuman. Sometimes we find parallels, 'which do not revert to Sanskrit originals, but to their later

stream, which came from Southern India to Java via Malay peninsula in a noticeably changed form." Influences of the Mahabharata are not less prominent. - In the same work, the king of Keling, who wanted to marry his son to Candrakirana, is described as a scion of the Pandavas." The names of Astina (Hastina), Pamade (Arjuna), etc., are referred to in many romances and they are equally significant.
Similarly, the princes and princesses of Koripan and Daha

are described as incarnations of Arjuna and Januvati Samba (Samba) and Subadra (Subhadra).
The names of Kama, Rati, Indra, Narada and others are also scattered in many writings.

It is noteworthy that these romances are also distantly connected with the history of Java. A better knowledge of Old-Javanese literature and history may possibly throw further light on the significance of the Pafiji-romances. The names of four or five kingdoms, which we come across in.
these writings, are hopelessly confusing in different versions.
It is amusing to record that four kingdoms, viz., Koripan, Daha, Geglang and Singhasari are described as contemporaneous with Majapahit on the one hand and Medang

These kingdoms covered the Eastern regions of Java and.
sometimes extended beyond it. It is not impossible that the original Pafiji-myth evolved through the times of supremacy ~ of these various kingdoms and these references are but

time, when the memories of these kingdoms were faded enough, there began the confusion of geographical names.
Dr. Rassers has started a novel theory that the oldest kernel of the Pafijiromance goes back <to the totemism of an exogamous society, which "must once have existed" in Java. He asserts further that the Javanese stage has also evolved from a totemistic rite. And accordingly, he has sought to interpret the old tribal organisations of primitive Java with their exogamous marriage relations in the light of the Pafiji-romances. It is here that we are compelled to part company with Dr. Rassers. We do so with much diffidence, but we are glad to see that we are not alone in our objection, for a writer under the initials of T. J. B." has lately raised some objections to his theory and has anticipated some of our arguments. Dr.

Rassers has seen totems and sub-totems in batik-patrons, kris-forms and in pamor-motives and has drawn an analogy

between the Javanese Kris and the Australian Churinga.' According to Dr. J.G. Fraser, "A totem is a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate, and altogether *** Dr. Rassers,"� on the other hand, regards essential identity of groups of persons with materials as a

cribed the period when the so-called totemistic groups, for which the analogy has to be procured from a far-flung continent, held sway over Java. The complicated Pafijiromances upon which he has relied first come to our view in the best days of Indo-Javanese culture ; they have then glided down to later period of Javanese history.
Was not the period, in which we find them, one of advanced civilisation? And how could the totemistic manner of thinking of a hoary past exert such a deciding influence on the later literature, which thereby assumed definite form ? Besides, what is the guarantee that every later writer of a new Pafiji-story should comprehend the so-called totemistic motive of these stories and manipulate them in accordance with the requirements of totemism, which, if at all present, must have been forgotten or totally re-oriented during the long, centuries of Indian contact? Under such circumstances we are inclined to believe that the kernel of the Pafijiromances is a Nature-myth and has nothing to do with totemism and exogamy.

Pafiji-stories are known for centuries in Java, Bali, Sumatra, Lombok, Borneo, Celebes, Cambodia, Siam and some other places of the Archipelago. But the

true character of Pafiji remains as wague as ever. His

real name (Pafiji being a surname) signifies a horse, and it is curious that he should accept a name which would identify him with a lower animal. In India, the term

J

means, 'almanac'. If a conjecture can be hazarded, he

is the Sun riding on horse, ever pursuing his beloved, the vanishing Moon.

CHAPTER XVI

THE TANTRI KAMANDAKA AND OTHER BEAST-FABLES.
( A ) The Tantri Kamandaka. �

Unlike the stories dealt with in the previous chapter, the Taniri Kamandaka has a distinct ethical background, which marks it out from other legends and romances.
It is closely connected with the well-known fable-books of ancient India, viz., the Paficatantram and the Hitopadef�ah. According to the computation of Prof. Hertel," the Paficatantram has at least two hundred different versions 'in more than fifty languages and three-fourths of these languages are not Indian. Indeed the strongest obstacles, those of language, custom and religion, have not been able to check its triumphal progress. The fable-book crossed the limits of India at least in the sixth century A.D., when it was translated into Pahlavi by the physician Burzuyeh in collaboration with the Indian scholar VuzGrjamehar during the reign of the celebrated Sassanide king Khusru Anusirwan (531-579 A.D.).� An Old-Syriac translation of this last work was made by Bud, apparently about 570 A.D. The Pahlavi version was again rendered into Arabic by Abdulla ibn al- Moqaffa by orders of the Caliph al- Mansur in the middle of the eighth century A.D. under the title of Kalila and Dimnah, of which a Malay recension exists. In the following century, Sultan Mahammad Ghazi commanded the preparation of a fresh Arabic version of the book. In the Far East too, we find Siamese and Laotian recensions in Cochin China, where Tantriis known as Tantrai, Tantai, Tantaiya ( and

Kantray). - In Indonesia the subject-matter of - the Paficatantram is distributed over at least twelve different recensions, of which the oldest three are written in a sort of Old-Javanese, several in the Balinese, two in the New-Javanese and two others in The lastmentioned nine versions are very young and, for our purpose, it is not necessary to describe them in detail.
Our attention will be mainly directed to the Tantri-group, which is formed by the Tantri Kamandaka, Tantri Kediri (B) and the Tantri Demung (M).

In Java, the recension beginning with the Demungmetre is the most popular one. Cod. 4541 of this work

has been written in Balinese character and it contains some Buddhist stories also.} It is divided into five cantos

containing 17 fables in 399 verses. The Tantri Kediri (B) appears to have been derived from a different source* and is not free from what we may call Balinism. This is less popular, but more modern than the rest. It contains some fables which do not come in the Demungrecension. Dr. Van der Tuuk�" doubts the genuineness of both these recensions. He says further, "The latter T antri Kediri)...... contains even Portuguese words (mifiu, e.g., a kind of beverage, is evidently=vinho). This version has but few tales, such as that of the deer, the mouse, the crow and the pigeon king, in common with the Hitopadesah and the Paficatantram. But the pigeon king is here called Kandaguna, the crow Hugata, the deer Turigapa and the mouse, Hiranyakta, the tortoise has no special name. The hunter is called Hastakrama." Regarding the two versions, the Tantri Kediri (B) and Tantri Demung (4), he says again, "In the story of the

grateful animals the name of the ungrateful goldsmith is Wenuka in (B), whereas in (4) and the Kamandaka it is Suvarnankara.""* The Tantri Kediri (B) runs into four cantos with 515 verses and is therefore more voluminous than the Demung-recension. As a matter of fact the former contains 11 fables more than the latter. The 'third recension is in prose and is known as the Tanisi Kamandaka, its language is older than that of the other two. Some of its stories end or are interspersed with Sanskrit verses which we find again in the Paficatantram.
We shall discuss this recension particularly because hesides being the oldest and the best preserved, it contains many fables from the Hitopadefah and the Paficatantram and like them, it is written in prose.

Dr. Hooykaas has observed already that - moral maxims in the Tantri Kamandaka are not written in Pali. There are doubtless some Sanskrit verses, but generally speaking they have been more or less corrupted The work betrays some Tantric influences and the references to Tantra-vakya, Tantra-katha and Tantra carita in several places are significant. The heroine of the story is Tantri, who was so called "since she knew the Tantras." Dr. Hooykaas' remarks that the Sanskrit formation of the name should have been Tantrni and that in the present state of our knowledge there is no means to discover the source of this name. The name of Kamandaka also raises a problem. It has been well conjectured that this name was introduced at a later period, because, the colophon of the work runs "'Ifi Candapingala samapta, Tantri-carita, Tantra-vakya" and there is no reference to his name. Kamandaka was an ancient author on Sanskrit Rajaniti and his name was well-known in Java as well as in India. In a Burmese

A Canarese version also knows one Durgasimha Vasubhaga.
This seems to connect the Javanese work with some South Indian recensions of. the Paficatantram. - The occurrence of Pali verses in the Laotian Paficatantra on the other hand, suggests that the source of the Tantri Kamandaka cannot be derived from that work of further India, where Pali and Buddhism were still flourishing.
This also takes us back to S. India. But the value of this supposition is weakened by our not getting the work of Vasubhaga and as such, the whole question should be held.

Tantri Kamandaka, the place of king Shahriyar has been occupied by Aif�varyapala otherwise known as Prabu Si~ Dara Patra, who has been described as a descendant of Samudragupta. The name of Aifvaryapala is as symbolical of his character as that of Tantri, which may mean 'thread uf stories'. The capital of this king, as the story: tells us, was Pataliputra-nagara, in the land Jambudvipa, in" Sri Laratanda. - The land lay to the south of the Himalayas and was pierced by the Ganga and the Yamuna. In the middle of these two rivers flourished the kingdom of PataliNow, the minister of this king, Niti Bandhesvarya, had the thankless task of procuring virgins of whom Tantri, his daughter, was the fortunate last victim. This section: makes a notable departure from the parallel portion of the Sanskrit Paficatantram, - which introduces the subject with Visnugarma& and his dull pupils. Is it possible that the original recension had any such prologue, which was given up by Visnugarma or Vasubhaga at any time after the reign of Samudragupta, when he felt the necessity of adapting the work for teaching purposes? In India there is no doubt the Jain Legend of Kanayamafjari, "'who retains.
for six months the undivided love of the king by the device of beginning a tale each night but not finishing it''," but it does not appear probable that such an obscure legend should exert a profound influence on the Tantri-literature of Indonesia. There are again no sufficient.
data for assuming that it borrowed the prologue from the Thousand and One nights, an Arabic Collection of which is stated to have been known in Egypt in the thirteenth century A.D. According to Mr. Lane,* "Several nights

that the Tantri Kamandaka combined Sanskrit and Arabic materials, of which the former supplied the frame-work and the latter the prologue. The on-rush of Islam had already begun in Indonesia and there is no wonder if the outline of this portion were suggested by the Arabic work. At any rate, the materials at our disposal are fiot sufficient for pronouncing a verdict on this point. The Tantri Kamandaka is divided into six sargas and this one goes by the name of viv@hasarga.' Then follows the second sarga called Nandakapraka@rana after the bull Nandaka. The line of demarcation between the third and the fourth sarga is not very clear. The latter sarga is called Sambaddha-�rgala-sangsarga, - Gajadruma-carita, Atat-ucarana. The fifth one goes by the name of Nandaka-prakarana, - Sambaddha-fergalasana. - The sixth or the last sarga ends with, 'It Sambaddha-carita, Hang�akiirma-sangsarga, udakarana, sesti sangsarga. The story is spun further in Cod. 4534, which ends with, 'It Candapingala samapta, T antri-carita, T antra-vakya.

The first story told by Tantri was that of the bull Nandaka, who was so heavily laden by the Brahmana Dharmasvami that he escaped to Ujjayini in the land of Malwa. When the story, which was told in detail, proceeded a bit further, the night was far advanced and so the story had to be left unfinished." Early next morning the king informed Niti Bandhegvarya that he was eager to hear the full text of the Tantri-carita which contained 390 stories. The following night the story was continued by Tantri who described the friendship of Candapingala and the bull Nandaka. The former was greatly frightened as he heard the bull roaring like thunder. When his Patih, the jackal Sambaddha, related to him the story of jackals who rent asunder a drum to find where the sound came from and naturally saw nothing," the lion became less apprehensive and made

CH. XVI] TANTRI KAMANDAKA & OTHER BEAST-FABLES 363

friendship with the bull." Tantri then related how the jackal succeeded at last in estranging both and how 'they killed each other after a dreadful fight. The framework of the Tantri Kamandaka, the Paficatantram and the Kalila and Dimnah is therefore the same. It is noteworthy, however, that in the Paficatantra-version of the story, we find Safijivaka and Pingalaka as the name df the bull and the lion respectively. Evidently the name of Nandaka has been derived from a different source, while that of the lion is not phonetically much changed.
The former - name occurs in the Hitopadesah.' It suggests confusion of the Paficatantra and the Hitopadesah materials. The names of the two jackals, viz., Karataka and Damanaka, have been changed into Kalila and Dimnah in the Malay and Arabic recensions. In the Tantri Kamandaka, their place has been occupied by the jackal Sambaddha. The frame-work of the Paficatantram (and hence, of some other recensions) has probably been depicted on the reliefs at Candi Jago. In the first terrace, according to Dr. Brandes," we find a lion, opposite which sit two jackals. To the south of this scene, we see a fight between the lion and a bull, behind each of which sits a jackal. The remaining portion has been badly damaged, but it suggests the feast they subsequently made. In the place of two jackals, the Tantri Kamandaka has only one. If the interpretation of Dr. Brandes were to be accepted it would follow that the tradition of the artist was derived from a source not identical with that of the Tantri Kamandaka. This will be clear as we proceed.

Then follows the emboxed tale of Gajadruma, king of Kausambinagara and two peacocks. This was narrated by the jackal Sambaddha.'* It describes how the king permitted his wife to kill four of his faithful ministers. He however came across a peacock belonging to a Savara or

hunter and another belonging to a hermit, whose speeches made a deep impression on his mind. This fable also occurs in the Demung-recension of the Tantri. The jackal Sambaddha is also the narrator of the following story which describes the fable of a tortoise and the two swans.' They lived in the lake of Kumudvati. The name of the swan was Cakranga, while his wife was known by the name of Cakrangi. The tortoise had also a name-he was called Durbuddhi, while his wife bore the name of Kacchapa.
In the Hitopadesah and the Paficatantram, the name of the tortoise appears as Kambugriva. His wife's name does not occur in these Sanskrit works. The name of the lake, however, appears in the Hitopadesah as Phullotpala, which tallies with the idea lying behind the Javanese name.
Again, the place of Cakranga and Cakrangi of the Tantri Kiamandaka is occupied by Sankata and Vikata in the abovementioned Sanskrit works. Now as the dry season appeared, the two pairs of swans and tortoises settled to fly off toManasara and not, as in the Sanskrit works, to some unnamed lakes. The two tortoises contrived to cling to a stick held by the swans in their beaks and thus by the power of their wings they shot aloft. When they came above the field of Vilangala, they saw two jackals below, Nohan and Babyan by name, who belonged to two opposite sexes.
The manner of death of the tortoises is identical in these recensions. In the Sanskrit works, however, the captors are different, In the Paficatantram, they are Paurah or citizens,.
in the Hitopadesah, they are herdsmen.

This fable was very popular in Java and it has been.
represented on reliefs in different temples. At Candi Jago" we find one swan carrying two tortoises. Opposite them are two dogs or jackals, probably jackals, who are very

busy in killing the fallen tortoises. This outline differs from the Tantri Kamandaka version of the story in respect of the number of swans. - It also differs from both the abovemoted Sanskrit works regarding the representation of the captors, who are other than citizens or herdsmen. The outline of this fable has also been depicted at Panataran.
Dr. Krom' writes, C.... At - Mendut, Barabudur's contemporary, we find the well-known story of the tortoise and the geese so depicted that on the same relief we see the tortoise being carried through the air on a pole and just �below on the ground being killed by the captors."

In the Tantri-group, this fable also occurs in the Demungrecension.

After the above story was finished, Sambaddha began

a

'the fable of tuma and the flea." The name of the turma or louse was Asada who lived on the blood of a king. In the crevices of the wall, there was also a starving flea, Candila by name. In the Paficatantram, the name of the latter appears as Agnimukha, while the KathGsaritsagarah calls him Tittibha. In course of time, the louse and the flea �came to know each other and the former asked his new acquaintance to cautiously feed on the blood of the king.
But he asked him not to be foolish like the heron who was killed by a crab. As the flea did not hear the advice �of the louse and bit the king before he fell asleep, he paid the penalty with his life. This fable occurs not only in the Tantri Kamandaka, but also in the Demung and the Kediri recensions.

An emboxed story to this began with the query of the flea who had asked the louse to relate the story of the heron and the crab.* The louse said that there was a lake called Malini, which was margined by rows of fruitful

Pretending that he would carry them to the lake of Andavahana, the heron smashed them on a flat stone and made a heavy feast every time. At last, a crab cliscovered the trick.

The return journey of the crab and the heron is not also told in the latter, though this occurs in the Paficatantram. This fable is also related in the Demung-recension.' In place of it, the Tantri Kediri (B): has the story of water-birds and the cuckoo."

The latter repaired to the sea-side and, to his utter astonishment, found an ape dancing in the middle of the sea. Frightened, he ran pell-mell to the king to report what he saw. The king came along with the servant to the sea- beach. He found nothing, because the ape was a Vidyadhara. Then he took the servant to task and killed him forthwith.

Now follows the story of a she-ape, Vanari by name(!), the daughter of Subuddhi. As the hunter Papaka was hotly chased by a tiger, she helped him to get upon a tree at the right moment. The tiger who remained at the foot of the tree suggested that Papaka might be treacherous to.

emboxed story with the query of the she-ape Vanari. In.
the Kediri-recension' the fable described above has been replaced by the story of the lion and the camel. The tale of the unfaithful goldsmith, related by the tiger," - also.
occurs in the Malay Hikaiat Kalila and Dimnah. lt may be summarized as follows :- .

There was once a Brahmana of the name of Sajfiadharmg# who set out for firthas in the dry season. Being thirsty, he went to a well, into which an ape, a tiger, a snake of the name of Vidyuta and a goldsmith had fallen. Though cautioned by the first three not to rescue the man, he dragged up all of them from the dry well. The tiger showed him his gratitude by offering him jewels and other ornaments that he had gathered after killing a prince.
Similarly, the ape gave him some provisions and fruits to eat. As the Brahmana had no necessity for the ornaments, he thought of presenting them to the ggldsmith, Suvarnankara by name, whom he had saved previously. So he repaired towards Madhura-Kling, where the goldsmith lived and gave him those valuable ornaments. When the whole affair was mischievously interpreted to the king, he brought \the Brahmana from the bathing-place and threw him into a subterranean prison. Thus an opportunity appeared for the snake to show his gratitude. He bit the foot of prince Virasena. The imprisoned Brahmana came out and with the help of the snake cured the prince. As promised before, the Brahmana got half of the kingdom. The family of the goldsmith, 'on the other hand, was punished. This fable occurs not only in the Tantri Kamandaka but also in the - Kediri� and the Demung* recensions. Such stories of the ungrateful man and the grateful beast belong to the treasures of world

The above fable contains an emboxed story, which, as a measure of warning, was relatediIto the goldsmith by his

wife and this may be described now. She related the tale

' also known by the name of Anti,

of the ape Murdasa, who resorted to hard penances for being as beautiful as the Vidyadhar Angaraprana@ (�paroa? ). A deity appeared -and instructed Anti to take his bath seven times in a certain place. Wanting to surpass even Uma in beauty, he took more "than seven baths and relapsed into the shape of the ape again. Similar stories are also current in India. Thus in the f Sanskrit Mahabharata� we read how the sage Cyavana, bent double with age, came out in dazzling beauty of youth after taking bath from a lake. In the Da�akumaracaritam we find that Mantragupta, getting into the confidence of a foolish king, persuaded him to take bath in the sea so that he might acquire greater beauty. Similarly, in the popular Story of Sukhu and Dukhu," which is current in Bengal, we see how Dukhu became the most lovely maiden of all lands after taking a certain number of baths, while her @ Sukhu, desirous of outrivalling Dukhu, became the ugliest of girls for exceeding the limit.

Let us now revert to the original story of the sheape, the hunter Papaka and the tiger. The she-ape said that tigers were more thankless than others and in illustration thereof she narrated the story of a Brahmana,* 'who, after finishing his Veda studies with Brhaspati, was returning to his own country. On the way, he came across a tiger who was bitten by a snake. Out of compassion for the noble creature, he uttered charms and thus removed the effects of poison. The ungrateful tiger however returned the service of the Brahmana by killing him. She incidentally remarked that in this respect crabs were better than tigers. Being asked why the

' She said that there was once

she-ape spun a fresh story.
a Brahmana of the name of Dvijef�vara, who hailed from Patala. He saw on a certain mountain top a crab of the name of Astapada whom he picked up to release in the water. When he fell asleep a snake and a crow, who were fast friends, laid their heads together to bring about the death of the Brahmana. The crab scenting their motives said that he could make their necks longer if they came near him and this, the crab contended, would enavie them to feed on the Brahmana.
As they lay to his left and right side, he speedily cut of their heads with his sharp bite. This fable occurs not only in the Taniri Kamandaka, but also in the Demung and the Kediri recensions.

As a retort to the foregoing story, the tiger narrated the fable of apes and weaver-birds. who lived as neighbours. The apes remained on branches of trees, while the birds lived in beautiful nests. Being jeered at for their incapacity to build dwelling places, the apes destroyed all vestiges of the nests of the weaver-birds.
This story not only occurs in the above three recensions of the Tantri-group, but also in the Hitopadesjah�.
The tiger however did not stop here. He adduced further illustrations*� to prove the foolishness of apes.
On one occasion, he said, a prince and a princess were loitering in a pleasure-garden which was studded with the most exquisite flowers. The ape Garubuh, whom they loved very much, had accompanied them. As the .
royal couple went to sleep, they asked the monkey to

keep watch over them. Now it happened that two green flies, male and female, coached themselves respectively on the neck of the princess and her royal consort. Remembering the orders of the prince, the ape,

in trying to kill the flies, separated the necks of the sleeping lovers. A Similar story has been related in the Parficatantram'. It differs from the Tantri Kamandaka on two important points. The scene is shifted to the royal palace and there is no suggestion of the sleeping partner. The name of the monkey again does not occur in the Sanskrit work. The fable has also been incorporated in the Kediri recension.

Let us now revert to the original story of the she-ape,.
the hunter Papaka and the tiger.� While the last one was relating these fables, the hunter had re-gained his self-possession. Me took his bow and aimed his last arrow on the tiger, who fled away with rapid strides. The hunter then said to the she-ape that he would not be able to go out from the '"wood-complex" and would deemm,it a favour if his female companion led him out of the labyrinth. The she-ape proposed that they should first go to her dwelling-place to take some rest. There they were welcomed by the children of the she-ape, Mardarva and Mardavi by name. As they were hungry, their mother went away to procure some fruits. Meanwhile, Papaka, cruel by nature, hit upon the plan of roasting the young ones to appease his hunger.
To dupe the she-ape, he set fire to the dwelling place and its neighbourhood and quickly dressed the roasted young ones to make a feast over them,. The she-ape returned only to see that everything was reduced to ashes, - Though she understood the reason of the disappearance of her children, she still complied with the request of the hunter to lead him outside the jungles.

At the outskirts of the forest, Papaka killed the she-ape, whose soul fled to the heaven of Indra. The writer

moralises by saying that the two young ones and their mother went to heaven, while Papaka, the hunter, was

thrown beneath the seven-hells, in Valukarnava. - On the temple-reliefs at Candi Jago, the theme of the fable has been depicted. Dr. Brandes* remarked long ago that the order of scenes in the temple-reliefs is different from that of the Tantri. - Besides, some new points are noticeable at Candi Jago. This fable also occurs in the Demung-recension. - The Tantri - Kediri (B), however, " replaces it by the story of the Lion and the Camel.
Sambaddha thereupon related the story of a she-goat, Mesa by name, who had saved her life as well as that of her child Wiwingsali, by bluffing a tiger." It happened that on one occasion, as they were grazing by the side of a mountain, a hungry tiger came to devour them. She scared him by saying that she was accustomed to eat ten tigers and he was but one ! The tiger fled away. On the way he met his friend the monkey. - As the latter pressed him to return, the tiger consented on condition that they should be bound together. In this way, they approached the she-goat, who exclaimed that the monkey had brought only one tiger and not more! The tiger turned back in hot haste and, as he did so, the skull of the ape crashed against the ground and he died! A similar story is prevalent in Tibet." The only differences are that the place of the goats has been occupied by two jackals and the scene has been shifted from the hillside to the den of the tiger. The monkey and the tiger are common factors, so also are the tricks. There is also a similar Malay story, in which the place of the she-goat has been occupied by a very weak buffalo. As the tiger came, an ape, who was on the back of the buffalo, said, "'This tiger's head tastes good !" The following portion of the story is similar to that recorded in the Tantri Kamandaka with the difference that in place of the tiger and the ape, we have here the tiger and the bear. The tragedy of death

was also averted in the case of the latter.! The Kaficil group of stories, which were widely prevalent among the Javanese, Malayese, Acehnese, Bataks, Filipinos, Dayaks, Cams, Cambodians, Sangirese, Lampongese," etc., contain similar stories in which a tiger and an ape, bound together by their own tails, came to a Wedus. The last one admonished the ape for not bringing more than one tiger! As the tiger dashed away, the monkey was smashed to death. In a similar Bengali story, a lamb says :''Sirther veta Bhamboledas, Sat sat bagh gili ek ek gras.
["'I am son of the lion, Bhamboledas by name. I devour seven tigers at a gulp. '] It is not impossible that the fable is based on an Austric kernel, which assumed slightly different

s + 4

forms on account of the migration of Austric groups in various directionsa Environment and Time-spirit also may have their toll, but itis clear that the ground-plot of the story is identical in the versions of these far-flung places.

In the Demung and the Kediri recensions, this fable has also been preserved. The reliefs at Candi Mendut and Panataran also depict the outline of this story."

Sambaddha, - the indefatigable - story-teller, _ then related the fable of the elephant who destroyed the eggs of the Siyung-bird." The female, mortified at the loss of her eggs, incited her mate to wreck vengeance on the elephant.

of vengeance. In illustration thereof, he related the story of Indra, who was passionately fond of a peacock." On one occasion Yama, the king of death, came to his court and the peacock, who was frightened by his presence, sought shelter under the throne of Indra. The latter, disgusted by his unmannerly behaviour, cursed him to go to hell. After the death of the bird Indra" was mortified for his rashness and tried to re-animate him. But Yama, Kala, Citragupta, who were approached by the king of gods, described their inability to re-animate the bird. This fable is also related in the Kediri and the Demung recensions. Ultimately, the well-meaning friends of the Siyung-pair suggested that they should resort to tricks by which they would be able to overcome the elephant as Garuda was by the tortoises. The woodpecker, whose name appears as Kasthakita in the Paficatantram, put a query which led to the narration of the following emboxed story. Thus, Wiyung related the fable of a race between Garuda and the tortoises*" who were systematically destroyed by. the former. The tortoises scattered themselves in different parts of the sea and when Garuda, as usual, asked for food, the captain of the tortoises suggested a race. The latter promised that if they were defeated in the race, their children, grand-children, and their progeny would be his prey for all times to come. Garuda agreeing, the race began. After reaching the other side of the sea, he saw that the tortoise had reached there already. This fable has also been related in the Demung recension. A fragmentary relief at Candi Mendut represents a turtle with its head turned upwards, whence Dr. Brandes infers that it may have some connexion with the fable described above. This story is paralleled by that of the Kaficil and the Keyong.� The

tale of the snail and the tiger,' which is a proto-type of the Tantri-fable, not only occurs among the Cirus, a savage tribe to the west of the Manipur Valley in Eastern India, but also among the Mal-Polynesian people. Mr. Scheltema� has noted that the story of Kaficil and the snail has travelled _to Europe and has been recorded by Jakob and Wilhelm

Grimm. We can only suspect the story to be of Austric origin.

The frog then entered the field of story-tellers and related the fable of Sand-piper birds who lived near the ocean." The male one was called Supnapada and his wife was Priyambada. His mate said, "'Father of my children, what I do now 3 Now I shall lay eggs."" She laid her eggs on the sea-shore and they were washed away by the Sea-god.
Extremely sorry, they referred the matter to Garuda who brought it to the notice of Bhatara Visnu. Through the mediation of Janasya, who was specially appointed for the purpose by Visnu, eggs of the Sand-piper birds were returned to them. This story also occurs in the Hitopadesah,* Paficatantram" and the Kathasaritsagarah.� In none of these works we find any reference to the third mediator, viz., Janasya. Besides, the names of birds given in the T antri Kamandaka are foreign to Sanskrit works mentioned above. The name Tittibha, which occurs in Indian recen.
sions, has also been corrupted into Tinil' in the Javanese

version. This fable has also been recorded in the Demung and the Kediri recensions.

The green fly took the cue from the frog and began to narrate the story of the hunter and the Brahmana.' The hunter once noticed that the Brahmana was enjoying: dishes prepared with milk and butter and wanted to know where they came from. Being informed that they came from a cow, he bought her and led her home. As he did not know the process of milching, he addressed the animal, "'Look here, Mrs. Cow, please give me milk and butter." Naturally, he obtained nothing. This story is also told in the Kediri recension, but not in the Demung one.

The woodpecker then related the following story." He said that on one occasion the bone of a man stuck into the throat of a tiger. The latter lay restless under the tree occupied by him. He brought it out on condition that the tiger would give him the heart of a hare. As the tiger refused to comply with the conditions of the bargain, the woodpecker pecked out his eyes from their sockets.

So the green fly, the woodpecker and the frog, respectively known as Vinarava, Kasthakita and Meghanada, accompanied by the crow, went to the naughty elephant.
One of them made him blind, the other made a wound, while the frog misled him by his croakings. And thus, the elephant was killed.

Sambaddha then related the story of the raven, the snake and the Kepuh-tree.� - This fable also occurs in the Demung recension, but not in the Tantri Kediri (B). It opens with a description of the miserable Kepuh-tree, Sisyapa by name, which stood in splendid isolation in the middle of the land called Sobha. On account of the molestation of young cowherds, its sprouts and branches could not shoot forth their twigs. A sympathetic pair of crows, of whom the male one was called Nila and the female one Kak [=Kak(a)l, devised a means to scare away the cowherds. The crow brought in skulls, bones, etc., and hanged up a corpse in the branch of the tree. The cowherds who assembled there next

day found out that the place was converted into a cremationground and they avoided the place in future. In course of time, the tree grew up in rich foliage and the female crow with the consent of Sigyapa laid eggs on its branches. The eggs were four in number, including the egg of a cuckoo.
The Kepuh-tree promised to protect them and thus eggs kurst into tiny birds. Now it happened that a snake of the name of Taksaka came there hungry and, convincing the tree of his strength and protective power, persuaded the Kepuh to yield him the eggs which he ate: . People now avoided that region as men died of snake-bite-panic prevailed among all peoples. Mangsalya, the level-headed chief of that region, therefore conferring with a sage set fire to the place and it brought about the ruin of the snake and the Kepuh.

Now follows the story of the crow Byarundi, who nestled on the branch of a tree with his whole family'. In a hole at the foot of the tree also lived a snake of the name of Sitara. The latter ate up the chicks of the crow and so Byarundi sought means of vengeance. On one occasion, he found prince Viraprana bathing in a certain place after putting off his ornaments ("'bhiusana"'). He swooped upon them and left them just near the hole of the snake.
Servants of the prince coming to recover them found out and killed the snake. This fable has not been described in the Demung and the Kediri recensions. It occurs.

Nandaka then related to Sambaddha the fable of the three fishes,* described in the Kathasaritsagarah', Paficatantram' and the Hitopadefah'. In the Demung and the Kediri recensions, however, this story has not been described.

viz., Anangaviduta, Pradyumnati and Yatbhavisyati. As the dry-season appeared, Anangaviduta proposed to set out for a different place and eventually he went away. As fishers came to overhaul fishes, Pradyumnati escaped in the manner described in Sanskrit works, while Yatbhhavisyati was killed. It is noteworthy that the names have been but slightly corrupted in the Javanese version. In sanskrit, theses

names have been spelt as Anagatavidhata, Pratyutpannamati and Yadbhavisya.'

Sambaddha then related to the lion the fable of king Aridharma, and the serpent-maiden, who was found enjoying herself with a spotted snake." While the king was out on hunting, he noticed them and, thinking their union to be a disgraceful case of Varnasaftikara or mixture of varnas, he killed the snake and slapped the serpentmaiden. Returning home, the latter invented a story to punish the king and this she related to her father, the king of dragons, who entered the royal kraton in the disguise of a Brahmana. Assuming his own form, the dragon-king hid himself under the throne of king Aridharma who was talking with his wife Mayavati. He gathered from the: conversation of the royal couple that his daughter had told him lies and so, assuming again the disguise of a Brahmana, he expressed desire to give a boon to king Aridharma.
The latter thus .got the power of understanding the language of beasts with the condition that he would not communicate it to any one else on pain of death. On one occasion he laughed after hearing the words of a certain Cecek. Being pressed by the queen to explain the reason, he said that he could not relate it till the funeral pyre was set up.
When he was there, he heard a conversation between a.

After this, we come to the closing portion of the whole book which describes the fight of the bull and the lion, engineered by the intrigues of the jackal. After their death -the lion went to the Visnu-heaven and the bull to the Siva-heaven. - After the death of the jackal, he was thrown into the hells of Valukarnava - Tambragohmukha and Yamaniloka, where he must remain for years, ten times the number of hairs on his body.

The beginning of this version agrees with that of other Tantri recensions. Then follows the story of Bayan Budiman which furnishes the frame-work of the Malay story-book. The frst story told by the peacock was that of the man who gave half of his life to his wife but was rewarded with ingratitude. This fable is also related in some Kaficil-stories and Malay writings. It also describes the story of a king of Palembang who dreamt of a beautiful princess, the adopted daughter of a white Garuda in China.
The king sent three of his sons to find her out, but before they could possess the object of their mission, the illegitimate fourth son espoused her after killing the bird.

The Balinese recension is of comparatively modern date, containing Malay, Portuguese and Sasak words. The spellings of proper names are also sometimes different from those of the Javanese recensions.

af _ It would appear from the above review thatthe Tantrigroup of stories in Indonesia is based on a folk-lore which is not probably exclusively Indian. Though we cannot find out the exact source of many stories, indications are available to show that some of them might have originated from

Austric thought. Itis also noteworthy that almost all the Sanskrit fables of the Tantri occur in the first book of the Paricatantram. In the Hitopadesgah, they are scattered through different parts. Besides, the arrangement of stories of avowed Indian origin in the Tantri Kamandaka is not similar to that of Sanskrit fable-books. It would appear again that so far as religion is concerned, the Tantri Kamandaka is a neutral work. It preaches the efficacy of charms and Tantras on the one hand, and refers to Sivaloka and Visnuloka on the other. In the story of Indra and his beloved peacock, Bhatara appears to be the highest God. We cannot, however, be sure about the religious views of the author, as he possibly relied upon some earlier writer, whose view of religion might have been reflected in

the Tantri Kamandaka, which we place c. 1200 A.D.

(B) Other Beast-fables.

Allied to the Tantri-group of legends current in Indo-MalPolynesia, there are yet some isolated folk-tales of a similar

character which we may conveniently group under this heading. From Tibet in the North to Bali in the South-East,

some of these stories are widely known and they have been handed down from millennium to millennium through the agency of nursery tales. A certain story of the Hitopade�ah which has not been described in the Tantri Kaman daka has been preserved in the Kaficil-group. In the Sanskrit work," we read the story of the deer and the crow who lived on friendly terms in the Campakavati-forest of Magadha. An unknown jackal appeared on the scene and induced the deer to graze on the rich harvest of the neighbouring field. The owner of the field who noticed the molestation carefully laid a snare into which the deer was caught. The crow who came afterwards advised him to lay motionless as a dead creature. As soon as the owner of the field pushed away the stag as a carcase, he made good his escape. The missile he threw against the deer struck

330 TANTRE KAMANDAKA & OTHER BEAST-FABLES

the waiting jackal, who breathed his last. In the Kaficilstory, the characters of the above fable are the Kidang, Ceplukan and the ape. The Kidang, i.e., the deer spoilt the field of the farmer in every possible manner till the latter was constrained to set a noose, by which the Kidang was captured. Ceplukan, who plays here the rdle of the abovementioned crow, advised the deer to pretend death. When the farmer released the snare, the Kidang escaped in hot haste. The missile hurled against the latter caused the death of the mischievous ape. In another part of the legend* the same incident has been repeated with the distinction that the part of the ape was played by Kuwuk.

There are some other stories paralleled by those of the day-dreamer Alanasker in the Thousand and One Nights and by the Brahmana who broke pots and pans in the Hitopadef�ah and the Parficatantram. A dealer of legen" (a kind of juice) fot upon a tree to gather juice in his bamboo-sheath. As the pot was already full, he thought of selling the juice and getting gold, with the help of which he would carry on business in hens. And this, he thought, would enable him to buy a house. Gradually he felt sleepy and missed his hold only to be killed below. In West Java, this story goes by the name of Tukang njadap lalamunan. The story of the mouse and the hermit is also very popular in India. The Hitopades�ah' describes how the sage Gautama transformed a young mouse into a stout cat which was again turned into a dog and the dog into a tiger. As the tiger wanted to kill him, the sage transformed him into a dog again. In Java also, there is the story of the porcupine and the hill}. As the latter was pierced by the porcupine, the hill wanted to be a porcupine and he became one. As he was in danger of dogs, he was turned into one of them. He

did not like to go a-hunting with his master and so he was made a man. He was now put into the transport service by the Kampong-head. After that, he went through the successive stages of lIurah, Camat, Vadana, ete. At last, good sense dawned upon him and he determined to revert to his former position, viz., that of a mountain.

Similarly, the story of Ucing jeung manuk titiran or the story of the cat and the turtle-dove' finds a good parallel in that of the blind vulture, the cat and the birds, which we find narrated in the Hitopadegah.' The Javanese cat is an exact prototype of the Sanskrit Dirghakarna and, though the Javanese story-teller does not inform us if he practised the Candrayana-rites, he at least performed tapas or austerities.
The Javanese cat ate the dove after gaining its confidence in the manner of the Indian Dirghakarna. There are some other stories of Indonesia which remind us of the V ianarendrajataka" in the Asinmsavagga, the Kumbhiraj�taka,� the Sigumarajataka," etc., without their Buddhist traits. The story of the ape and the crocodile in the Paricatantram is also not different from them. It is not easy to say at the present moment if these stories were Mal-Polynesian, or, if they spread to the Far-East through the activities of early Indian �colonists.

Of many stories current in Mal-Polynesia belonging to the Kaficil-group, we have an interesting story exactly paralleled by one extant in Bengal. The Bengali story describes how a jackal entered into a deadly feud with a crocodile. On one occasion, while the jackal was crossing a river, the crocodile, who was seeking for an opportunity to wreck his vengeance, caught the jackal's leg within his jaws and was about to smash it. The jackal smartly reminded the crocodile that it was merely a stick and not a leg, as he had supposed. When the foolish crocodile loosened his

- grip, the jackal leaped ashore. Now, sometime afterwards

when the crocodile was basking by the side of a river, the jackal was constrained to pass by that way. To know if the crocodile was wide awake, the jackal began to speak aloud, "If the crocodile be alive, he must remain motionless ; if he is dead, as he appears to be, he must move his tail and limbs." The crocodile preferred to show off himself aga dead creature and began to bestir himself. The jackal escaped.

In the Kaficil-stories, the part of the jackal was played by Peucang and Kidang who are noticed in the same

' The former, viz., Peucang, after

escaping the jaws of the crocodile in the manner of the jackal in the Bengali folk-tale, went to sleep in an island which was soon afterwards surrounded by hungry crocodiles.
He talked with them and this brought the scattered crocodiles in a file and he escaped by running over their body. Kidang, who occupies the place of the abovementioned Peucang in a different place, queried in the manner of the jackal if the body he noticed was that of a crocodile, or, if it was merely a tree-trunk. The following portion is identical with the Bengali folk-tale. It is clear therefore that this Bengali folk-tale, heard even now among untutored villagers, is exactly identical with the second version described above both in names as well as in details. Considering all the points we regard the tale to be a contribution of Bengal, but we retain our doubts which Raksasas and evil spirits play a prominent rdle.
The popularity of the epic literature and superstition of the peoples are probably responsible for their prominence in Indo-Mal-Polynesian folk-tales. The Malay people* still think that when Pitalo Guru (apparently Bhatara Guru) banished evil spirits, for certain reasons, into a forest,

they vowed eternal vengeance upon mankind. It is said

that they number 124,000. Their spirits have enveloped Mal-Polynesian thought.

We thus come to the end of our studies on the IndoMal-Polynesian folk-literature. When we analyse the class of beasts who appear in the rdle of the main characters of the stories, we find jackals, apes, deer, tigers, crocodiles, elephants, frogs, crows, mice, figuring prominently. The tricks � they employ to outwit their opponents are naive and sometimes humorous. When a petty creature, for example, has to scare away a more powerful animal of superior build, he generally employs three kinds of tricks. By dying the mouth red he produces the impression that beasts of his opponent's species form his usual dish ; by alluring an animal into wells, pits or muddy ponds he escapes, and by exciting the wrath of the foolish beast against some imaginary foe he utilises the opportunity to make good his escape. Other tricks have also been employed, but they are isolated. All these tricks betray the genius of the early story-tellers, some of whom might have lived millenniums ago. The stories seem to indicate again that they then believed everything to be talkative, -trees, stones, ants, birds and all ! They saw round them "brothers and sisters in fur and feather, tame and wild." To them, the world was not cut up into artificial divisions as it has been now. The above characteristics, therefore, demonstrate the existence of a golden thread that binds the countries of South-East Asia in a common relationship.

CHAPTER XVIH INSCRIPTIONS AND HISTORICAL LITERATURE

(A) Inscriptions

We have said before that the early inscriptions of Java -have been written either in South Indian or in North Indian scripts. It is also noteworthy that in composition, they sometimes betray Indian influences. Almost all the inscriptions of Java, like those of India and her Far-Eastern colonies, open with invocation to various deities or with the words Om Svasti or Siddham. Then they furnish us with the dates of their composition. To take some instances : a stone inscription of the year 775 Saka opens with "Svasti Sakavarsatita 775 Asadha masa tithi dvitiya suklapaksa tu.
pa. a. wara- '* etc. Similarly, an inscription of the year 694 not only opens with the invocation, '"Om nama�ivaya namo Buddhaya,"" but also furnishes details of dates, "Svasthi Sri Safijaya varsa 694 Posya masa tithi tritiya krsnapaksa..." etc." They may be compared, for example, with the Udayagiri cave inscription of Candragupta II,} which begins with ''Siddham || Samvatsare 80 2 Asadha-masa-gukle(ai)kadasyam |" The pillar inscription of Goparaja,* to take another instance, also opens in a similar way. In the Sena inscriptions of Bengal, this is generally to be met with towards the closing portion. The style of writing, whether in Sanskrit or Kawi, sometimes reminds one of the style of Indian inscriptions. The stereotyped curse-formulas are,

however, distinct features of early Javanese records, which mark them off from Indian inscriptions.

(B) - Historical Literature

� \ There are some historical works extant in Java. It is difficult to say, however, who taught the Javanese people the science of writing history, -a science, in which the

Indians themselves were so deficient. Though we cannot be certain, it is possible that the Chinese people imported the science from their own country. Because, during a millennium of Indo-Javanese contact, no historical work was written. - It is only during the days of closer contact between Java and China that we first come across Javanese historical writings. - It may as well be a fact that the Javanese peopies themselves were responsible for the development of the science. We propose to give here an account, necessarily brief, of the more important historical writings of Java, though our main attention will be devoted to Indian influences on them. ( , The Nagarakrtagama, which engages our attention first, '

� & 9 %

has been described as a work of "unique importance.

It has been written in various Indian metres and is divided into ninety-eight cantos. The author of this work was Prapafica who composed it in 1365 A.D. during the reign of Hayam Wuruk, a contemporary of Feroz Tughlak (1351-1388 A.D.). The name of the book appears only on the title page ; in another part of the work it has been

called After a brief notice of Ken Angrok of Tumapel (1104-1147 Saka),"� the account gradually becomes more interesting and informative, particularly from the reign of some of the immediate predecessors of Hayam Wuruk. It was indeed the most brilliant period of Javanese history. The court of Hayam Wuruk was graced by many eminent poets. Prapafica himself says that Panditas of other lands composed eulogistic poems on His Majesty.
The monk Buddhaditya, for example, composed Bhogavali on him in many Slokas. The Brahmana Mutali Sahrdaya also composed an eulogistic poem ""in correct Slokas." * According to Dr. Kern, Mutali is a Tamil term corresponding to Mudeliar of our own days. Among other learned authors

we find the names of Bhamana and Brahmaraja. Many

Panditas are described as having mastered different Sastras.
There were others again who composed many Slokas by sitting in company." - Prapafica says that he composed some other books as well, viz., Sakabda, Lambang, Parvasagara," Bhismasgarana and Sugataparva." That his father was also a poet is probably suggested by his statement, "The pleasure created in the poems by me cannot be satisfactorily followed by persons other than poets and sons of poets." It would appear, therefore, that the reign of Hayam Wuruk forms an epoch in old-Javanese history. Some other important Kawi-works were also composed during this reign and we had occasion to describe them in previous chapters.
Prapafica was, like his father, the Dharmadhyaksa of the country and his remarks on religion necessarily possess high authoritative value. The author not only refers to the Siva-Buddha cult, but also describes King Hayam Wuruk as an embodiment of this uni-dual deity. He further says that statues of Amoghasiddhi, Aksobhya and Vairocana were instituted in the royal mausolea." The King's grandmother, who was like Parama Bhagavati, was zealous in the yoga and meditation on Buddha, which she performed as an old nun in the dress of the spiritual orders." Traces of Tantricism are also rampant in the work. Belief in magic is betrayed here and there. The Mahayanist priest Bharadha is not only called Yogifvara, but also master of the Tantric lore. He can walk on water and soar in the sky,;-a feat described also in the Pararaton. Like the T antu Panggelaran, the Nagarakrtagama also refers to the magic circle or 'mandala.' The use of words like Bajraka, Kabajradharana, Bajrasana, etc., is also significant. Free

monasteries of the regular Buddhist monks have also been

mentioned in canto LXXVII. We have previously referred to the Tantra Subhiiti which was specially studied by King Ertanagara (1268-1292 A. D.). Dr. Bosch thinks that this work may be identified with the Vajracchedikaprajriaparamita,. Another important point mentioned by Prapafica is the �Sraddha-ceremony of Gayatr Devi which was actually held in 1362 A. D. A vivid account of it has been given in cantos LXIII-LXVII.

Let us now note Indian influences on the style of Prapafica. In giving dates, the author, like other Javanese writers, has favoured the use of Candrasarikala, The work, written in various Indian chandahs, has been divided into cantos of unequal size and some descriptions strikingly remind one of their parallels in Sanskrit literature. Thus, at the time of the birth of our poet's patron, "...the thunder rumbled, flashes of lightning pierced the sky, a tumultous uproar arose in the mountain of Kampuda...... and the scoundrels and villains were overpowered. It was a positive proof that Bhatara Girinatha took birth in the form of the sovereign. ' '* In Sanskrit works, such things also happen at the time of the birth of an important person". Flowers are also rained from heaven and gods blow conch-shells in applause.

We now pass over to the Pararaton (Ken Angrok) or the Book of the Kings of Tumapel and Majapahit. From the colophon of MSS. C and B, it appears that the work was extant in the beginning of the 16th Saka century. From internal evidences, it appears that the last mentioned facts do not go before the 15th Saka century." Its chronicleform demonstrates the text to have been composed off and

on. Itis probable therefore that the work was composed in the last part of the Majapahit period*, c. 1278-1478 A. D.

388 INSCRIPTIONS AND HISTORICAL LITERATURE

Some portions of the book may be still younger. It has been written in prose and the language may be described as Middle-Javanese,. The whole work is divided into eighteen chapters. The first part opens with the well-known Indian formula, "om avighnam astu namas siddham." This section of the work is extremely legendary arid the anonymous author (or authors) has given a vivid description of the romantic or rather grotesque adventures of the future king. He was the offspring of his married - mother's dalliance with god Brahma who met her on the field. He has been described as an incarnation of Visnu. The more historical parts begin from where Ken Angrok, after removing from his way Tunggul ametung, the akuwu of Tumapel, married his widow Ken Dedes and became the chief of Tumapel. He is the first king of the dynasty of Singhasari and hence, the founder of the royal house of Majapahit. From this period, the work sometimes becomes surprisingly accurate, though episodes like those of the Kris invite scepticism on the part of the critical student. Dr.
Krom' suggests therefore that the writer of the Pararaton relied on some chronicles on the one hand and some storycomplex on the other. It is also noteworthy that some portions of this work, when controlled with the help of inscriptions and Chinese notices, are found to be unsatisfactory. Indeed, the legendary part of the Pararaton comes into a prominent relief only when one compares it with the Nagarakrtagama.

These are the two books which may, with some justice, be dubbed historical works. The Library of the University of Leiden possesses a large number of works which are partly chronicles and partly historical romances. The literary form in which these romances or traditions have been couched goes by the name of Kidung,-a literary genre that is distinct from Kakawins. Dr. Berg" thinks that

the writers of these historical poems might have twisted historical themes for romantic effect. And in illustration thereof, he refers to the Kidung Sunda, whose last part describes how Ayam Wuruk (Hayam Wuruk) died of sorrow because he was responsible for the death of his beloved, the princess of Sunda." Though the author probably incorporated current traditions on the subject, stories of such ''great historical nonsenses. It is noteworthy, however, that the Middle-Javanese 'historical' traditions yield some new data which we do not find in

% �

description are really

the above two historical works. To take some instances: the Usana Java (whole first part), the Pamaficangah and recension A of the Kidung Sunda concur in describing an expedition of Gajah Mada to Bali, but we do not find this in the Pararaton. Similarly, the Pamaficangah gives an account of a royal conference called by Ayam - Wuruk (Hayam Wuruk) at Majapahit after the Geath of Gajah Mada, but this has not been mentioned in the Pararaton." If such notices cannot be controlled with the help of inscriptions and other trustworthy evidence, it is natural for us to be sceptical about their authenticity.

The word Pamaficangah means 'Babads', to use a modern Javanese translation of the term. It is no proper name - and it signifies 'historical works in general.
Friederich" refers to a certain Pamendanga,' which Berg thinks to be identical with Cod. 4361 of the Pamaficangah.
The former scholar described it as a sort of chronicle of more recent times containing confused history of priests and kings, of 'the division of Bali amongst the original Pungavas of Gelgel and genealogy of kings, of KarangAsem, for example. Prof. Berg says however that the

description of this work by Friederich and Juynboll is either misleading or one-sided." It begins with the usual formula.
Avighnam astu. The work is divided into chapters. It gives an account of the establishment of a Javanese colony from Majapahit in Bali up to the fall of Gelgel and the rise of Klungkung. Cod. 5058 (1) of this work speaks on the genealogy of the dynasty of Pakapisan. The list of descendants of Nirartha is described in Cod. 5243. There are other Pamaficangahs dealing with local history.

The title Usana Java, or the ancient history of Java, is a misnomer. - This book has been described by Friederich" as a work relating to the conquest of Bali by the Javanese of Majapahit. The king of Vilvatikta, i.c., Majapahit sent his brother Arya Damar and his patih Gajah Mada for the conquest of that island.} The work then narrates the settling of Deva Agung in Geigel with an account of the division of lands amongst the nobles of the court. In places, it is legendary. The Usana Bali,* which, according to a certain writer, shows partiality for the dynasty of Arya Damar, has been described by Friederich as a work exclusively intended for tlie people, and not esteemed by the priests. - The - subject of the Middle-Javanese historical romance Rangga Lawe was described by Raffles" long ago. The poem is called Pafiji Vijayakrama in Mss. It narrates the war between

{ Daha and Tumapel, the foundation of Majapahit by Raden Vijaya, the revolution of his trusted officer Rangga Lawe and so on. As Chinese annals give detailed accounts

of this period, we have here a unique opportunity of assessing the real value of this historical romance. This work has to be placed in 1485 Saka, i.e., 1543 A.D. According to Dr. Brandes," it is more important from the literary point of view than from the standpoint of history. Its contents run parallel to chapters V, VI, VII and the beginning of the VIllth chapter of the Pararaton.

The Kidung Sunda" is also a historical romance describi?g the journey of the Sundanese royal family to Majapahit for performing the marriage ceremony of the Sundanese princess with Hayam Wuruk, the king of Majapahit. Due to differences of opinion regarding the relation of Sunda and Majapahit (1349-1357 A. D.) war broke out between the two powers and it resulted in the destruction of the Sundanese at Bubat. As regards the date of this work, we have no positive information. Gunfire has no doubt been mentioned, but Dr. Berg" thinks this ta ba no proof of the late origin of the work. Recension B of this work appears to be younger than the Rangga Lawe, because in it (2/1339) the horse of Patih Anepaken has been compared with the horse Anda Wesi of Rangga Lawe. As the date of the romance Rangga Lawe falls in 1465 Saka, recension B should be of about 1550 A. D., or a little later. It has been !
supposed, however, that the tradition is older than 1550 A.D.

We had occasion to state elsewhere that some Kawiworks� were composed not long after the date of the Nagarakrtagama which falls in 1365 A. D. After this, darkness falls on Indo-Javanese literary history from c. 1378 to c. 1525 A.D. Owing to political turmoils in Java, Bali assumes predominance during this period and, along with this, the centre of literary activity shifts from Java to this island. - This became the cradle of Middle-Javanese Literature of the Kidung-class.

was not unknown in Java, it found a more welcome home in the island of Bali. The radiating centre was Gelgel, which occupied the position Majapahit had lost,. The story of the shifting of literary activity is probably typified in the story of the Pamaficangah' regarding Nirartha who is considered as the forefather of the Balinese priests. He came from Majapahit to Pasuruhan via Daha and thence to the island of Bali after halting at Blangbangan. Invited to Gelgel by its king Batu-Renggong, he settled in a cloister and began to compose books. Hig work Sarakusuma was written as a." At least fourteen

an answer to the poem Smardarcana." works stand against the name of Talaga, the son of Nirartha.� His son obtained a great name as a poet, philosopher and judge. It has also been recorded that he was versed in T arka-vyakarana. As Nirartha came to Bali c. 1550 A D.," literary activity continued at least from this period onwards.
Indeed, the family pf Nirartha had a great share in the development of Balinese literature between 1550-1600 A.D.

The Rangga Lawe, the Kidung Sunda (B), the two prose Usanas and some other works were composed in Bali and, as such, they had no direct connexion with the Javanese historical tradition, which filtered in through Javanese colonists of Bali in the palmy days of Majapahit. It is therefore natural that the above-mentioned works, though they handle subjects described in the middle portions of the Pararaton, differ on important points from the latter. It has been supposed that these discordances are due to poetical fancy. The historical or semi-historical portions of these romances are, therefore, the result of an effort to synthesise Javanese traditions of the epoch of Hayam Wuruk, of the immigrants in Bali and their forefathers in Majapahit."

On the New-Javanese historical works, viz., the Babads and the Sajarahs, confusion of fact and fancy has wrought its worst havoc. The reconstruction of Indo-Javanese history

The usual explanations of this phenomenon are the following :(a) Political turmoil, which continued, of and on, from the fall of Majapahit to the second half of the 18th century A. D., (b) the penetration of Islam which broke the continuity of old history, (c) the confusion in old literature which was little understood, (d) the influence of written and oral tradition on each other, (e) the incompetence of later compilers and lastly, (f) the anxiety of the post-Majapahit kings to be included in the lists of Solar and Lunar dynasties.

These works which we may call 'historical' only by grace may broadly be divided into two parts, the first part describing the traditions of older times, the second part dealing with the period after the introduction of Islam. In some works much heterogenous matter has been "mixed up. For example, the Pustaka raja purva, one of the works of Rangga Varsista, who was court-poet of Pakubuvana VII (18501858 A.D.), not only incorporates materials from the Mahabharata-Ramayana-purana, but also from the Kaficil-group of stories." In the Babad Tanah Jawi, again, we find in the royal list Arjuna and his forefathers who are prominent figures in the Mahabharata. Siva and Brahma also appear as the forefathers of the Javanese. Thus, Indian and MailPolynesian mythology, mixed up with historical traditions preserved in the romantic literature, fabricated and genuine stories, sometimes intermingled with cosmogonical fragments from works like the Manik Maya-have produced this hodgepodge of a chronicle which is anything but true history. It must not be understood, however, that all compositions are.
couched in the above spirit. Dr. Hazeu' says that the

portions which contain Java's modern history (from c. 17th century onwards) may be dubbed really historical.

The titles of these Babads are suggestive of the period they describe. The Babad Besuki, Babad Bandavasa,

Babad Balambangan, Babad Madura, Babad Janggala, Babad Majapahit, Babad Mataram are instances in point. Babad Dipanegara was composed by an exiled king and it gives a resume of Java's older history. - Babad Palihan negari begins with the foundation of Surakerta and ends with Mangku negara's accounts (recension of Yasadipura). Similarly, Babad bedah Ngayogya offers details of the history of Yogya up to the storming of the Kraton by the English.� On many of these Babads, the influence of Islam, as is natural, has been greatly projected. In the Babad Tanah Jawi, for example, we find Adam as the forefather of the Javanese kings. The history of the Prophet and the adventures of some heroes are reflexes from Muslim tradition. Dr.
Djajadiningrat� refers to the story of Jaka Bodo, where traditions of Mahammad have left unmistakable traces. Though the Pustaka raja purva and other books of that category pretend to give the history of Java from year 1 onwards, they betray, in many cases, no rational chronological idea.
It is not difficult to prove that names of countries and persons have been confused and wrong dates have been given in many cases.

Now, these traditions regarding Java's older history originated from the laboratory of Mataram, probably in the beginning of the 17th century A. D.} Many stories were earlier canonised and they occur in a similar way in different Babads. All these works are in sharp contrast with the preMuslim Javanese historical works which, though containing

CHAPTER XVIII CONCLUSION

We thus come to the end of our survey of Indo-Javanese literature, which almost suddenly springs into existence, like Minerva, armed at different points. Though Sanskrit synonyms with short explanations in Old-Javanese and other cognate literature appear to date from about 778 A. D., literature proper does not come to our view before the end

of the Oth century A. D. From that time up to the 15th century A. D., the stream of literary enterprise runs vigorously. Most of the works of this period belong to the class of Epic literature. Though they do not contribute much to the quotapf world-literature, they have yet some value from the view-point of India's contribution. Artificial in many respects, they yet throw some side-lights on Indian culture and history. While reading these Kawi-works, one seems to think that he is reading an Indian work in one of the great provincial languages. Sanskrit words and verses scattered throughout the work sustain this impression.
The real value, then, of these works is that they afford us an opportunity to control the statements of some Indian works and enable us to follow, more or less closely, the process of transformation of Indian culture as it leaves India's shores. It must be said, however, to the credit of Javanese authors that though they have developed mainly an artificial translation-literature, they have sometimes handled them in a refreshingly original manner. A tinge of sexuality has, however, marred much of its beauty. But it is also sublime in its spiritual appeal, and both these traits were probably harmonised in the Indo-Javanese period.
Javanese literature has its shortcomings too. The drama and the lyrical poetry, to judge by the extant works, have not engaged the attention of the Old-Javanese authors,. Some branches of science again were in an embryonic stage of development. In other forms of literary

CH. XVIII] CONCLUSION 397

composition, e.g., texts on erotic, music, animals, birds, etc., Javanese authors betrayed commendable capacity and varied interests in the practical problems of life. Unfortunately our knowledge of Old-Javanese language and literature is not sufficient and the contour is hazy in many respects. The extant remains are still among the grandest treasures that any nation may bequeath to posterity without feeling any shame and diffidence. For all these we must hail across the ages Indian sailors and teachers who raised the "population to a comparatively high and permanent civilisation and made Java what Marco Polo found it 'une ysle de mout grant richesse' -a character that it still has.""

P. 5 As Kombeng images of Borneo do not belong to the school of Indo-Javanese art, some are inclined to believe that there was a direct stream of immigration from Southern India. This is not however admissible on the following grounds: (a) dissimilar contemporary images have not yet been discoverd in Java to negative the theory of immigration via Java, (b) Kombeng images may belong to Post-IndoJavanese art ; this will account for their difference from the products of Indo-Javanese art, (c) they cannot be old for being found in an old cave.

"j; P. 95 In Art. 121 of the Kutiramanava, the origin of l the Kutara-ga@stra has been traced to Bhrgu and Prof. Majumdar says that the Kutaramanava indeed betrays the influence of Bhrgu and Narada. These references are interesting in as much as the works of Bhrgu and Narada were also known in Campa." In the work some passages from the Sanskrit text have been translated twice. Articles 211 and 261 which respectively mention Paficasadharana and Jivadana have been borrowed from Sanskrit texts. Vakcapala and Hastacapala which crop up abundantly in Old-Javanese inscriptions are the same as Vakpadrusya and Dandaparusya of ancient Indian jurists, Articles 66 and 67 describe the '""blood-price."" In the sphere of criminal law the KutGramanava widely differs fron Indian codes. It expressly states | that the king is the owner of the land, and handles |. regulations regarding slaves.

The major portion of the work has been written in a comparatively young language. It was composed under the patronage of king Jitendra of the Sailendra dynasty, but he is not known from any other source. Prof. Krom places this work between c.750 and 850 A.D.

As Old-Javanese literature is mainly a religious one and as the two historical works, the Nagarakrtagama and the Pararaton, deal with Java's later history, our authority necessarily a late one. But our : hypothesis receives some - confirmation - from the - early - Kawi-epigraphy - of Java - which," according to Dr. Brandes,! shows remarkable affinity with the alphabets of the Girnar inscription.
Prof. Krom*' has recently pointed out some differences also but it has to be remembered that the earliest dated Kawi-record of Java is several centuries later than the Girnar inscription and the variations . noted by Dr. Krom may as well be due to diverse factors in the history of Indo-Javanese script-evolution.

with the work of Valmiki, this is extremely doubtful.
If the Sanskrit epic lay before Yogifvara, it was natural that he should borrow some words, consciously or unconsciously, from the Skt. masterpiece, After comparing the Old-Javanese text' with relevant portions of the Skt. Ram., we find that not a single Skt. word from the latter occurs in corresponding passages of the Old-Javanese text. It is noteworthy, however, that some portions of Yogisvara's work are almost an exact echo of the text of Valmiki. Thus str. | and str. 7 as given by Kern may be compared with chap. 46, slokas 3-4, 29-32 in relevant portions of the Skt. text.
The conclusion of Dr. Poerbatjaraka, based on unconvincing arguments, is not therefore acceptable.
