## Introduction

It is difficult to provide a precise survey of this field because of the nature of the discipline and its relationship to cognate areas such as archaeology, ancient history, law, literature and anthropology. However, I have spread my net as widely as possible in order to avoid painting too gloomy a picture of the current teaching and research interests in this vitally important area, and have tried to indicate, where appropriate, those with tenured university positions, and those retired and non-tenured academic staff who are still actively engaged in research on South-East Asian history. The survey has been divided into two parts Mainland and Maritime South-East Asia - and is followed by a brief summary of recent developments and future prospects, such as they are.

### Mainland South-East Asia Burma Thailand Vietnam Cambodia And Laos

By far and away the largest group of historians working in this area have research interests in Thailand. These include four holders of tenured posts in British universities:

1. **Dr PJH Tuck**, Lecturer in Modern History at the University of Liverpool, who has worked on Anglo-French imperial rivalry with relation to Thailand, Vietnam and Burma.

2. **Dr Nigel J. Brailey**, Lecturer in Eastern Asian History at the University of Bristol, whose current research interests are in domestic Thai politics and international relations both pre-1925 and 1925-70.

3. **Dr Ian Brown**, Lecturer in Economic History with Reference to South-East Asia, SOAS, who is researching the determinants of economic change in early twentieth-century Thailand and the impact of the Depression of the 1930s on the Thai economy.

4. **Dr Clive J. Christie**, Lecturer in Modern South-East Asian History at the University of Hull's Centre for South-East Asian Studies, who has a research interest in literature relating to the era of decolonisation in South-East Asia (1945-75) with special reference to the portrayal of minorities and Montagnard peoples. His earlier focus was on modern Vietnamese history, but his current involvement in the Hull Centre's 'Peripheral Areas and Minority Groups' project is likely to shift his attention more towards Thailand in the next few years.

All the above are supervising, or have supervised, M.A. and Ph.D. students working on modern Thai history.

In addition, there are two other historians with major Thai interests who do not have tenured university posts:

1. **Dr Andrew D.W. Forbes**, currently Senior Associate Member of St.
Antony's College, Oxford, who is working on research projects relating to the role of Islam in modern Thailand, the Ayutthayan trade systems of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the Chinese (Yunnanese) minority groups in Thailand, Burma and Laos. Like Dr Christie (above), he is also involved with the Hull Centre's project on 'Peripheral Areas and Minority Groups'.

2. **Ms Judith A. Stowe**, Thai Programme Organiser, BBC External Services (London), who is currently working on a monograph on Thai domestic politics and international relations between 1932 and 1945.

If one counts in other academics with interests in Thai archaeology and early history, such as **Dr Janice Stargardt** (Cambridge) and **Dr Ian Glover** (Institute of Archaeology, London); and historians and political scientists with other mainland interests, who deal with Thailand in their teaching and research, such as **Dr Ralph Smith** (Reader in the History of South-East Asia at SOAS) and **Dr R.H. Taylor** (Professor-elect in Politics with Reference to South-East Asia at SOAS), then it is clear that Thailand is better served at the present time than any other country in South-East Asia with regard to teaching and Tesearch interests amongst British academics in the UK. This may be due to a number of related factors - viz. the relative openness of Thailand to foreign researchers in modern history, the provision of adequate Thai language teaching facilities at SOAS, the anglophone traditions of the Thai elite, who have tended to send their children to the UK for periods of further study (a trend which is now on the decline), the importance of Thailand as the fastest developing economy in South-East Asia and its pivotal role in regional politics (especially in Cambodia). It is likely that this concentration on Thailand will strengthen in coming years.

When one turns to work being done in the historical field on Mainland South-East Asian countries outside Thailand, scholars with tenured posts are few and far between. For Burma only **Dr RH Taylor** and **Ms Patricia Herbert** (Assistant Keeper of the South-East Asian collections in the British Library's Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books), have major research interests in modern Burmese history, and the former is a political scientist rather than an historian by training. It should also be noted that SOAS enjoys the services of two outstanding teachers of Burmese language and literature, Ms Anna Allott and Mr John Okell. As of the time of writing, I am not aware of any British Ph.D. students working for doctoral degrees in modern Burmese history and this situation is unlikely to change during the coming years.

As for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, only **Dr RB Smith** of SOAS, **Ms Laura Summers**, Lecturer in Politics at the University of Lancaster, and **Dr Clive Christie** of Hull, can be said to have research interests in the modern history of those countries. **Dr Dennis Duncanson**, recently (1984) retired as Reader in Political Science at the University of Kent, and **Col Hugh Toye**, also continue to keep alive their research interests in Vietnam and Laos respectively, but neither are planning major new historical studies in the near future. It is fortunate to note that both Vietnamese and Cambodian (Khmer) are currently taught at SOAS, so historians embarking on doctoral dissertations in these fields can pick up a reading facility in these important languages.

### Maritime South East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and The Philippines)

This region, which contains by far the largest country in South-East Asia (Indonesia; pop. 178 million), is not well served when it comes to modern historians with tenured posts <in British universities. Under a decade ago, there were no less than six historians and political scientists at SOAS (**John Bastin**, **John de Casparis**, **Malcolm Caldwell**, **Jeremy Cowan**, **Ruth McVey**, and **Merle Ricklefs**) with teaching and research interests in this region. Indeed, the absence of an historian of Indonesia at the major Centre for South-East Asian Studies in the UK is a reflection of the losses suffered by the discipline through government enforced retrenchments in recent years. The survey of country interests in this section will start with Indonesia.

## Indonesia

There are currently only two tenured historians with major research interests in modern - Indonesian history at British universities:

1. **Dr CW (Bill) Watson**, Senior Lecturer in South-East Asian Studies at the University of Kent at Canterbury, who is working on the role of Islam in present-day Indonesia in the context of the current Kent South-East Asian Studies Centre project on Islam in South-East Asia.

2. **Dr Peter Carey**, Fellow and Tutor in Modern History, Trinity College, Oxford, who is working on late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Javanese history.

However, it should be pointed out that the latter's post is not specifically earmarked for South-East Asian history, and that interest in the region in Oxford will lapse when he either leaves his post or takes early retirement (in the mid-1990s) and that Dr Watson's training was as an anthropologist, and the main focus of his work is on social change in contemporary Indonesia not on modern history per se.

There is now one Research Fellow in post working on modern Indonesia:

**Dr Anthony Milton** - (Stipendiary - Research Fellow, Clare College, elected 1989 for three years), who is embarking on postdoctoral research on post-War Christian politics in Indonesia with special reference to patterns of political leadership and ideology.

In addition to the above, there are several scholars who have either recently retired from academic life or who have specialist interests cognate to modern history, who maintain an interest in Indonesian history. Amongst the former, can be mentioned, **Dr John Bastin** (Reader Emeritus in the Modern History of South-East Asia, SOAS), who is currently working on the natural history researches of Raffles, Horsfield and Jack in Indonesia and Malaysia; **Dr Leslie Palmier** (retired Reader in Sociology, University of Bath, and of St Antony's College, Oxford), who is preparing a study of the social origins, education and role of the modern Indonesian intelligentsia; and **The Rev Dr GE Marrison** (ex-Keeper of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books at the British Library), who is doing research on the languages and literatures of Bali and Lombok and the seventeenth and eighteenth-century history of Blambangan (East Java).

Amongst those teaching in British universities in other disciplines, holding library posts or involved in broadcasting on Indonesia are the following: **Mr Ben Arps** (Lecturer in Indonesian and Javanese, SOAS), an expert in Javanese wayang (shadow-play) and a trained dhalang (wayang kulit puppeteer), who is completing a doctoral thesis on sekar ageng Javanese forms of verse used in Surakarta, c. 1780-1870, and the wayang kulit traditions of Banyuwangi in East Java; **Dr Michael Leifer** (Reader in International Relations, London School of Economics [LSE]), who has an interest in modern Indonesian politics and international relations; **Dr Ulrich Kratz** (Reader in Indonesian, SOAS), who is currently working on a catalogue of the letters of Francis Light (1740-94) and early German travel accounts of Indonesia (in collaboration with Dr Hans-Dieter Kubitschek of the Humboldt University, East Berlin); **Dr Angela Hobart** (Ph.D. SOAS, 1979; now working as a teacher in London), who has recently published a study of Balinese theatre, myth and ritual, **Dr Jan Wisseman Christie** (Honorary Fellow of the Centre for South-East Asian Studies, Hull), who has interests in the archaeology and early history of the Maritime - South-East Asian states, especially Srivijaya and Majapahit; **Dr Mike Hitchcock**, currently of the Horniman Museum but who is taking up a post in sociology at Hull from October 1989, and is interested in the history, development and material culture of Eastern Indonesian societies; **Ms Annabel Teh Gallop** (Assistant Keeper of South-East Asian manuscripts and Printed Books at the British Library), who is concerned with modern Indonesian and Malay literature; **Mr Colin Wild** (Head of the BBC's Indonesian and Malay Service), who is preparing to embark on an Oxford D.Phil. thesis on the history of broadcasting in Indonesia (1920-66); and **Dr Michael Williams** (Senior Talks Writer for the BBC Far Eastern Service), who has a research interest in the recent history and contemporary politics of Indonesia, especially the influence of Islam and communism.

As far as I am aware, there are currently very few students enrolled in British universities working on Ph.D.'s relating to modern Indonesian history, but this situation may change now that the Centre of South-East Asian Studies at Kent has more Indonesian M.A. and doctoral students (funded by a new World Bank loan for Indonesia), coming to do degrees in the social sciences.

Mention should also be made here of Alec Roth's recently completed (1987) Ph.D. thesis for the Department of Ethnomusicology at Durham University (entitled 'New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan'), and the new programme he has established, in cooperation with the South Bank Arts Centre, on Javanese music, which has already led to plans being made for a major exhibition of Indonesian Arts and Culture to be held at the South Bank Arts Centre in the summer of 1990.

## Malaysia

There are currently only two tenured historians at British universities with interests in modern Malaysian history:

1. **Dr DK Bassett**, Senior Lecturer in South-East Asian History, University of Hull, who is currently working on the history of the English East India Company in South-East Asia (with special reference to 'country' traders) in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

2. **Dr AJ Stockwell**, Senior Lecturer in Modern History, Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, who is currently doing research on decolonization in Malaysia (1945-57) and intends to write a biography of Sir Hugh Clifford.

It should be noted, however, that Dr. Bassett will be retiring in 1992 and he is to be replaced by Dr T Huxley, who is a specialist in the field of strategic studies, defence and security issues and who has concentrated on Indochina-ASEAN relations.

In addition to the above, the following have interests in aspects of modern Malaysian history, but do not hold academic posts in British universities:

**Ms Janice Brownfoot** (36 Elgin Crescent, London, Wll 2JR), who has a special interest in the social history of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia during the colonial period, especially the role of women in colonial society; **Mr JM Gullick** (retired MCS official, 56A Monkhams Lane, Woodford Green, Essex, 1G8 ONR), who is cooperating with the Editor of the Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (JMBRAS), on a monograph comprising essays and catalogue material from libraries and archives in the UK with holdings of original documents and photographs on Malayan history; and **Dr Roger Kershaw** (Lecturer in Modern Department of Education, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei), who has an interest in the local politics and history of Kelantan; the plural society in Malaysia; and authority, state and revolution in post-1957 Malaysia.

There are several graduate students from Malaysia and Brunei currently completing M.A. and Ph.D. theses on Malaysian historical topics (mainly relating to law and Islam) at the University of Kent, see the list given in Peter Carey, Maritime Southeast Asian Studies in the United Kingdom. A Survey of their Post-War Development and Current Resources, Oxford: JASO, 1986, p. 66, and at the University of Hull, see Annual Report, Centre for South-East Asian Studies, 1987-88, pp. 5-6. At Hull, GE Saunders has recently successfully defended his Ph.D. thesis 'The Anglican Mission in Sarawak 1847-1941' and Nik Anwar Nik Mahmud his doctorate on 'Anglo-Thai Relations 1945-1957'. There is also a student at SOAS (Ms Ingrid Floering) currently completing a Ph.D. thesis on the post-War economic development of Malaysia. Mention should also be made here of **Dr AV Horton**, who recently completed a Ph.D. thesis at Hull (1985) on the development of Brunei during the British Residential Era (1906-59), and continues to maintain a research interest in Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia (he has plans to write a history of the 1962 rebellion in Brunei led by AM Azahari Mahmud, based on the latter's papers, and has published several articles on Brunei history since completing his thesis).

Finally, in connection with Malaysia and the history of Maritime South-East Asia more generally, the following names of individuals who have a general research interest in the whole region can be mentioned:

**Professor CR Boxer** (Emeritus Professor of London and Indiana Universities), who, in his late 80s is still active in research and publishing in the field of European company trade in South-East Asia and the South China Sea. He is currently working on a history of Macao, the activities of the Swedish East India Company at Canton, and the spice trade in the Moluccas from 1500 to 1650; **Dr John Villiers** (21 Overstrand Mansion, Prince of Wales Drive, London, SWll 4EZ), who is currently working on a major translation series of Iberian documents relating to Portuguese and Spanish commercial activities in Maritime Southeast Asia in the 16th and early 17th centuries and on a biography of Affonso de Albuquerque; **Mr AJ Farrington** (Senior Assistant Keeper, India Office Library and Records), who is preparing a bibliography and list of English East India Company ships' logs and other references to maritime trade routes in the India Office Records; and **Professor MB (Barry) Hooker** (Professor of Comparative Law and South-East Asian Studies at the University of Kent), who is currently completing a multivolume description of the laws of Southeast Asia, and has just completed a major new project on the published works on the Malay alim, Sheikh Daud Patani. The latter project has been funded by grants from the British Academy's South-East Asia Committee.

## The Philippines

Until the February 1986 revolution which brought Mrs Aquino to power, this important country (pop. 58 million) had a rather low profile in British universities, with very few tenured staff and little research work being undertaken by staff and students, a rather ironic situation when one reflects that it has long been one of the most open countries in the region for foreign researchers, and, prior to the American annexation of the Philippines in 1899, was a country with which Britain maintained very substantial financial and business interests, interests which are reflected in some of the specialised library collections on the Philippines in this country (e.g. the Edinburgh University Library).

Although there is still today only one tenured British academic with primary research interests in the Philippines (**Mr Peter Ayre**, Senior Lecturer in Economics with Reference to South-East Asia at SOAS, and he will be retiring in 1990. Current research interest: international commodity trade, finance, domestic monetary institutions and policy in the Philippines), this situation is likely to change in the coming years as more British academics with South-East Asian interests turn their attention to the Philippines. **Dr RH Taylor** (see above Section A) is now developing an interest in Philippine domestic politics, and his colleague at SOAS, **Dr Ian Brown** (see above Section A), also has a subsidiary interest in modern Philippine economic history. **Mr Jim Richardson**, who recently completed a SOAS Ph.D. thesis on the Philippine Communist Party (PKP) in the pre-War period, continues to maintain a research interest in Philippine politics, and is currently compiling an annotated bibliography on the Philippines for the Clio Press's World Bibliographical Series. Furthermore, one graduate student at Oxford in the Social Studies Faculty, **Mr James Putzel** is preparing a doctoral thesis on Philippine land reform and another, **Fr. Warren Kinne** (Columban Fathers) is about to finish a doctoral thesis in the Dept. of Theology, University of Birmingham, on the Mindanao-Sulu Catholic Church between 1971-82. It is possible that there will be more such graduate students in the near future as public awareness of the Philippines continues to grow in Britain.

## Conclusions

The study of South-East Asian history at British universities has clearly been badly affected by the recent government cutbacks. The situation is particularly serious with regard to Indonesia, easily the largest country in the region, where the number of tenured historians, research fellows and graduate students, is pitifully small. Although the recent World Bank loan for training in the social sciences may change the picture slightly at Kent, the long-term outlook for the study of Indonesian history in the United Kingdom is not good unless money is forthcoming to restore some of the history posts lost at SOAS over the past decade. Given Indonesia's political and strategic importance, an importance which is bound to increase in the next few years as the Suharto regime comes under ever increasing economic and political pressure, the provision of adequate teaching and research posts should be top priority for university planners.

Elsewhere, the picture is more varied. Teaching and research in modern Thai history seems to be quite well established and may develop further during the coming decade as Thailand's economy continues to grow apace. Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, areas where Britain has long enjoyed a special relationship, are likely to hold their own in terms of academic research in the humanities, although it may be increasingly difficult for historians to gain access to historical archives and post-War collections of documents. Interest in Burma and the Indo-chinese states (with the possible exception of Vietnam) will remain weak, but there may be a deepening interest in the Philippines especially if political and economic developments continue to keep that country in the public eye.

Daw Aung San Suu-Kyi, daughter of the late General Aung San, intended to enrol at SOAS to work towards a doctoral degree on Burmese nationalist literature in the period 1900-42, but political responsibilities in Burma are likely to prevent her from doing so for the foreseeable future (June 1989).
