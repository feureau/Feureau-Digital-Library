The Cultural Ecology of Early Nineteenth Century Java

Peter Carey

Occasional Paper No. 24 December 1974





FOREWORD



It would seem superfluous to stress that there be little or no meaningful understanding of the his realities of the region without a proper appreciatior the cultural dimensions of the societies or events und study. Yet studies incorporating a full understandin of local cultural ecology, including a balanced analy of indigenous sources, perceptions and viewpoints, ar few and far in between, partly, perhaps, because of t tendency to dismiss or downgrade local sources, wheth they be oral or literal, as being of little historical value. Viewed in this light, Mr. Peter Carey's effort to put some of the nineteenth century Javanese Babad (Chronicles) in their proper perspective and cast light on their importance in understanding contemporary Tin Javanese society is all the more welcome. Let's hope 4 his example will stimulate other similar studies not only in Indonesia but in the other countries of the region f as well.

In wishing Mr. Peter Carey and his paper on The Cultural Ecology of Early Nineteenth Century Java all the best,it is clearly understood that responsibili for facts and opinions expressed in the work that follo rests exclusively with Mr. Peter Carey, and his interpre tations do not necessarily reflect the views or policy of the Institute itself or its supporters.

NOTE ON THE SYSTEM OF JAVANESE TRANSLITERATION

The system of transliteration used here is that which was established by the LZmbaga Bahasa Nasional Congress in Yogyakarta (D.I.Y.) in January 1973. The tja becomes ca, the da becomes dha, dja becomes ja, ja becomes ya, nja becomes nya, and ta becomes tha. Only the pépét is shown.





Introduction“

In this paper I wish to consider some of the Javanese Babad (Chronicles) sources for the period of Pangeran Dipanagara (1785-1855) and the Java War (1825-1830) , and to provide some tentative suggestions as to ways of analysing these Babads in their cultural context. In his article on Sufism as a category in Indonesian literature and history, Professor Johns opened by making some general remarks as to the need for non-Indonesian historians of the archipelago to rethink their historical conceptions in terms which would have meaning for the society they were proposing to study. Thus historical characteristics and concepts should not be imposed from without, but should be firmly based on the cultural particularities of the society in question to enable the historian to look outwards from his subject rather than inwards from another position.! It is with some of these cultural particularities as regards the Babad literature, the historical literature, of Central Java in the early nineteenth century that I will be concerned with here, and in this I will take the small body of historical literature about Dipanagara, known under the general title of Babad Dipanagara, for a case study.

It is not possible here to discuss in detail the background and authorship of these Babads, although much basic work still has to be done in the important fields of palaeography, the dating of the MSS., and in more detailed historical research on their authorship.?" In brief the collection of Babad Dipanagara can be divided into three main groups: those written by Dipanagara and his family; those written under the orders of the Bupati of Purwarëja, Raden Adipati Cakranggara I (1830-1862) , generally known under the title Buku KZdhung KZbo; and those written at the courts of Central Java, Yogyakarta and Surakarta.
For the purposes of this paper, three particular MSS, will be singled out for discussion as they represent the most original Babads written by contemporaries.

The first is Dipanagara's own Babad written in Menado in just under three months (13 November 18313 February 1832), one third of which concerns the history of Java before Dipanagara's birth, and the rest describes the history of his own life and times down to his exile in Menado. It was probably dictated by Dipanagara to his scribe and the most original extant copy is written in Pegon (Javanese written with Arabic letters)} which was a script used widely amongst the more orthodox religious circles in Java.

Finally there is the Surakarta Kraton Babad, LOr 2114, which was written at the outbreak of the Java War itself, in August 1825, and although it is only a fragment of a longer Babad, it is the most contemporary document available. The copy which is now in the Leiden University Library was probably made originally for use in the Javanese language school which J.F.C. Gericke set up in Surakarta in 1832."

All three of the above MSS. can be regarded as historically of great value because of the fact that they were written by contemporaries and 'in the case of the first two because they were written by major protagonists in the Java War. But although they contain much information of an historical nature they cannot be viewed in the same light as a western historian might view the memoires or autobiography of an important historical figure. Firstly because the Javanese Babad was essentially a literary endeavour and not just an historical account, thus it was written in verse (tEmbang) as opposed to prose, and often used many poetic words and literary forms which are not found in everyday language, It was split up into various cantos each with its own metre, which served to heighten the effect of the Babad's delivery as it was usually recited or sung at large gatherings and the changing metres accorded with the subject matter. Thus the Durma and Pankur metres with their closer clipped staccato rhythm were more appropriate for descriptions of battle scenes, and the languorous and stately Asmaradana and Sinom metres were more suitable for scenes at the court, love affairs, and discussions on politics. The key to the change of the metre was usually interwoven in the last couplet of the preceding canto by certain key words, and often the skill of the poet (pujangga) could be judged by the subtlety with which he was able to disguise the change in metre so that it would not detract from the smoothness of the recitation. The person intoning the Babad would, however, know that a change in the rhythm of the verse was required and would alter his voice accordingly. Such recitations (macapatan)

of Babads are common both at the court (kraton) and in the villages (desa) where there are often readings from the Babads at all night celebrations (leklekan) for pregnancy, births or marriages." The Yogyakarta Kraton Babad was regarded as so powerful (kramat) , dealing as

it does with such tragic events at the Yogyakarta Kraton, that it was until recently only sung amongst the closest members of the Sultan's family.!

Secondly, quite apart from its literary function, the Babad was important as a symbol of the legitimization or authorization of power in the Javanese context, for a ruling dynasty or even for a family, and particular Babads often had the status of pusaka (sacred family heirlooms). The verb mbabad, to clear a forest or a wilderness, from which the noun Babad is taken, denotes its function for it was often seen, along with the physical foundation of a kraton, the gathering of pusaka, and the establishment of administration and cultivation, as an important part in the foundation of a new kingdom. **

Thus it was the function of the court poet, the pujangga, to rewrite or bring up to date the court chronicles at an important period, and in this elucidation of family trees, the linking of the new dynasty with Javanese mythical figures and even sometimes with the Prophets (SZjarah

kiwa and were crucial in the legitimization of a dynasty. This was probably one of the reasons for the flourishing of Javanese historical literature at the Central Javanese courts after the Treaty of Giyanti in 1755, which had divided Central Java between Yogyakarta and Surakarta, for each court wished to prove its legitimacy as the sole ruler of

As far as the Babad Dipanagara are concerned, at least in the case of Dipanagara's autobiographical Babad and the Buku KEédhung K%bo, this question of legitimacy and the authorization of personal power are crucial themes. The question of pamrih (selfish or concealed personal motives) is a central consideration in the Javanese philosophy of power and it is dealt with fully in the two Babads.!

Both Babads also stress at the beginning that they were written for the benefit of the descendants and family of

the authors and thus had the quality of unique family pusaka. In Dipanagara's Babad this theme appears as both spiritual and personal; thus in the introduction Dipanagara asserted that he was writing out his own life history to assuage his great grief in exile and also to beseech the grace of the Almighty for his own sins and for his family.!" It is in many respects a moving personal document which evidences Dipanagara's great religious sincerity which

he wrote for himself and his descendants, and deals centrally with the question of why he arrogated power for himself and

under what authority. In the case of the Buku Kdhung Kbo, the object is essentially the same but couched in a more worldly context, for Cakran&gara wished to provide a foundation charter for the dynasty of Bupatis which he had established at Purwaréja (Bagélen) and his exploits during the Java War were thus central to the foundation of his authority. !° It also deals with the question of power and pamrih in terms of why Cakrangara decided to fight against Dipanagara, and why he, a mere descendant of kyai's (men of authority/country gentlemen) in Bagëlen before the Java War, should have risen to become a Bupati. The Buku KZdhung KZbo was thus the pusaka of the Cakranggara family and was just as important as the building of the new Kabupaten (Bupati'!'s residence) at Purwaréja and the assumption of Cakranggara's new title in the consolidation of his power in Javanese terms.

This search for legitimacy and the discussion of pamrih in the Babad Dipanagara are postulated in traditional Javanese cultural and cosmic terms, and it is with some of these concepts that the rest of this paper is concerned.

In each of the Babads there are important passages which deal with the wayang (Javanese shadow play),'° and in the case of the two main Babads, there are others which deal with dreams and visions and their interpretation. It will be argued that these are not merely literary flourishes or digressions into the realms of the absurd, but important passages which deal directly or indirectly with the role

of power and the way in which Javanese contemporaries might have seen themselves or their opponents. Thus although they would be classified as unhistorical by the western reader, they nonetheless offer clues which can afford crucial insights into the historical material of tbe Babad, and a discussion of them can help to define some of the cultural conceptions which a non-Indonesian historian Javanese Babad material.

One subject which cannot unfortunately be discussed in detail within the scope of this paper, but which is directly relevant, is the role of Islam both as a legitimizing

force within the traditional Javanese cultural framework, and also as an innovating force during this period. It

is a central consideration for anyone who wishes to understand the early nineteenth century in Java, but it will be dealt with here only in so far as Islamic concepts might have impinged on the themes discussed below.

Importance of Wayang in Javanese Culture

Before discussing in detail the main themes as they present themselves in the Babad Dipanagara it is perhaps necessary first to preface such a discussion with a short note on the importance of wayang in Java. The influence of wayang symbolism and mythology, in particular examples taken from the Rama and Pandhawa cycles which form the basis of most of the wayang lakon (plots), cannot be overemphasized even in present day Java.!" These wayang stories, many of which were originally inspired by the great Hindu epics of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, offer a vast range of different characters and situations with which individual Javanese can identify.'' They present too at a much deeper level for the Javanese the very quintessence of the struggle between good and evil in a man's soul' and a mystical insight into the hidden mysteries of man's life on earth.'!* This central importance of wayang in the Javanese world view was apparently recognized by the wali'sS, the traditional saints of Islam in Java, who according to tradition in Java, used it as a vehicle to

convey the doctrine of Islam. Thus Sunan Kalijaga, the

most effective of the wali's in this respect, is reported

as telling the Sultan of Demak that, "The wayang show is

indeed a [mirror]-image of the One, one can call it the

image of the Law. The wayang stands then for all mankind,

[and] the dhalang (puppeteer) is to be compared: 'with Allah,

the creator of the Universe ...."** It was probably

partly in this sense that Dipanagara himself understood

the meaning of the wayang, for in his crucial encounter

with the Ratu Adil (Just King) in May 1824, he used just

such a wayang simile to portray God whom he described as

holding the plot of his life in his hands.21 Yet despite

efforts to graft Islamic concepts onto the wayang, it is

arguable that it has remained the purest expression of

Javanese mysticism with its stress on the quest for truth

within- a man's soul, and self-knowledge leading to mystical i union with the Godhead." |

If wayang symbolism and mythology is still influential today in shaping the actions of Javanese politicians how much more so was it important in the society of early nineteenth century of which Dipanagara was a part: Java was then a society steeped in an understanding of wayang myths and stories. The Yogyakarta Kraton Babads, for example, carry numerous references to various types of wayang performances which were held in the kraton at the time, and of these the wayang wong (theatre) performances appear to have been the most popular. ??

even mentioned that a main cause for complaint against the Yogya Patih (Chancellor), Danuréja IV (1813-1847), was

that he had arrogated for himself the right to hold a wayang wong performance in his dal¥ém (residence) just before the outbreak of the Java War in July 1825.** During the celebrations for Sultan Haméngkubuwana IV's (1814-1822) marriage to the daughter of Patih Danur&ja II in May 1816,

no less than three full-length wayang kulit performances

were held in the kraton together with wayang wong and

seven other different kinds of wayang shows.?° Later a Yogyakarta Patih, Danuréja V (1847-1879), owed much of his early advancement during the reign of Sultan Haméngkubuwana V (1822-1855) to the fact that he was so skilled in the presentation of wayang wong performances at the court."

It is interesting to note that the favourite wayang wong performance of Haméngkubuwana V was the Wayang Wong Trunajaya which recounted the rebellion of the famous seventeenth century Madurese rebel. Perhaps this was no coincidence considering HamEngkubuwana V's youth had been so dominated by Dipanagara's rebellion!

Yogyakarta Kraton in the early nineteenth century were the Arjuna Sasrabau (Arjuna Wijaya) , Sérat Rama, Sérat Bratayuda and the Arjuna Wiwaha (Mintaraga), and these may have formed the basis for many of the wayang lakon's shown at the A Dutch report mentioned that Ratu Kéncana, the widow of Sultan Hamérgkubuwana IV, during a period óf illness in

1825, had not slept for two nights but had read wayang stories continuously. ?® In Surakarta, Sunan Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820) , a great patron of the arts, was supposed to have been so keen on wayang kulit and wayang wong performances in the Surakarta Kraton that he sometimes acted as the dhalang himself and encouraged members of his family as wayang

topeng dancers.*'" In the countryside too it is almost certain that there was a considerable interest in wayang

for many of the best dhalang at the courts came from the villages and some must have led a wandering life in the countryside giving performances from village to village. ''

An official Dutch report which was circulated to Residents after the Java War complained of the influence of wayang

on the orang mZnumpang (landless labourers) and described how their imaginations were fired by wayang tales of | adventurers. who had raised themselves to princely status.?!

Despite his considerable devotion to religion, Dipanagara himself was probably no exception to this interest in wayang amongst the Javanese nobility of the day and kept a large gamélan (Javanese orchestra) in his dalgm at Tögalröja. °? A later Dutch visitor to the ruins

Dipanagara's Autobiographical Babad

In Dipanagara's own Babad there are various passages which suggest that he was himself aware of the model of Arjuna, the third of the five Pandhawa brothers, who was renowned both for his physical beauty and great spiritual strength. ®"! Thus during Dipanagara's meeting with Ratu Kidul, the Goddess of the Southern Ocean and spiritual protector of the Kings of Java, when he was still a young man, he described how he was given an arrow, Sarotama, by her which he later fashioned into a kris (dagger) .** Sarotama was the weapon of Arjuna and the way in which Dipanagara received the arrow strongly recalls the way in which Arjuna received another arrow, Pasopati, from Siwa in the 4rjuna Later in his Babad, when Dipanagara related his wedding in c. 1814 with the orphaned daughter of Raden Rangga Prawiradirja III of Madiun (1796-1810) and Ratu Madur&tna, he described the marriage in terms of Batara Wisnu's marriage to Dewi Sri, with his father, Sultan Haméngkubuwana III (1812-1814) as Batara Guru, and the Sultan's consorts (Ratu) as Ratih, Supraba, and Tllottama°”° The description is cast in traditional terms, but it once again recalls the figure of Arjuna for the God Wisnu was supposed to have been incarnated on earth as Arjuna."! The theme is referred to again even more explicitly during Dipanagara's meeting

with the Ratu Adil in 1824, when in terms similar to the ones used by Arjuna to Krésna before his battle with Karna in the Bratayuda, he begged to be excused from waging war for he said that he could not fight or bear to see death."" Finally the theme occurs again at the very end of the Java War when Dipanagara was wandering nearly alone in the jungles of Bagélen and Banyumas (November 1829-January 1830) accompanied by his two panakawan (intimate retainers), Banteng-wareng and Rata, the first of whom was described in the Babad as a mischievous young rogue and a dwarf . " * The description recalls the deformed servitors of the Pandhawa, Sémar, Gareng, and Petruk, who also followed their masters off into the jungle after Yudistira had

lost the kingdom of Ngastina to the Kurawa at a game of dice. This analogy between Dipanagara and the Pandhawa

is made even clearer when the names of S&mar, Gareng and Petruk were given to the three B2kZI1 (village heads) from the surrounding area who attached themsélves to him. ~The Babad also added the detail that the names suited the physical apgearance of the and the latter found them good."

Of all the texts read by Dipanagara and his circle at TZgalr&ja it seems likely that the Arjuna Wiwaha had the most influence on him and important comparisons can be drawn with passages in his Babad. It is interesting too that the Arjuna Wiéwdha was one of the very few texts in the Yogyakarta Kraton which survived the plundering of the Kraton library by the English in 1812." Today the wayang lakon of the Arjuna Wiwaha, usually known under its modern title of Mintaraga, is regarded as one of the few great mystical lakon's by the Javanese and as a counterpart to the lakon Bima Suci. In the latter the theme is that of Bima's quest for the water of life and cosmic self-knowledge whereas the former deals with Arjuna's preparation through asceticism to achieve invincible power to rule the world and triumph over the

forces of evil."" Earlier according to Dr. Pigeaud the Arjuna Wiwaha text was especially popular amongst Javanese authors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who "saw in the poem an allegory referring to

a superior man's struggle in life, his victory over demoniacal powers and his final apotheosis ....""*" It

is probably both in this light and in the original

sense of the text, that of Arjuna's preparation for

just rule in the world, that it can be seen in connection with Dipanagara, for the way in which he described himself in his Babad as retiring to practise ascetitism;and emerging purified for battle is strikingly similar to the way in which Arjuna prepared himself 'in the Arjuna Wiwaha.

. Thus throughout the early part of his Babad before the outbreak of the Java War, periods -of asceticism with the object of purification for spiritual rule are referred to frequently. Dipanagara's uncle, Pangeran Mangkubumi, is made to comment in the Babad that even as a young boy Diganagara loved to wander off alone into the and Dipanagara himself described at some length his visits to the traditional holy sites of Mataram and the visions he received on journeys between Yogyakarta and the Southern Ocean."° His infrequent visits to the Yogyakarta Kraton are also stressed in his Babad and there are descriptions in other Babad's of his periods of asceticism both at his own retreat at Tégalréja, Selaréja, and at the cave of Sécang on his estate at SEélarong to the south of Yogya.""

be classified in traditional Javanese terms as tirakat, the withdrawal: from the world and the asceticism of a man who contemplated a serious undertaking such as becoming a rebel (kraman), for it afforded a time of solitude to question the inner motives for such an act and purge oneself of pamrih."! In Dipanagara's case, however, the period of preparation and purification was to lead to a much wider and more important undertaking than that of mere rebellion as his meeting with the Ratu Adil was later to confirm. Like Arjuna in the Dipanagara described too how he was often exposed to the temptations of and the analogy is elucidated further in various passages in which he depicted his wife as Supraba, the heavenly consort of Arjuna in the Wiwaha tale."

as handsome in traditional Javanese terms."" Nevertheless the constant theme of spiritual preparation and refusal

of temporal power by Dipanagara before the Java War does strike a close comparison with the figure of Arjuna in

the Wiwaha. Later Dipanagara's summons and meeting with the Ratu Adil bears some resemblance to Arjuna's

encounter with Indra, for both are summoned by old men clad in religious clothes who then disappear to allow the Ratu Adil and Indra to manifest themselves., The injunctions which Dipanagara and Arjuna received also bear comparison for both are brought forth from a period of asceticism to receive the mandate of battle.""

The Arjuna theme in Dipanagara's Babad is obviously important but it is one of many and should perhaps best be considered in relation to others which hold an equally important place. Thus throughout Dipanagara seemed to have been acutely aware too of the wal?'s and of his ancestor Sultan Agung as examples which had relevance to his situation, and it was probably in their function as spiritual protectors of Java that they had significance for him. Thus early in his wanderings Dipanagara described how he received a visitation from Sunan Kalijaga who prophesied that he would become king, but rather in the manner of a spiritual overseer of the temporal rulers of Java, than merely as a temporal ruler himself.""

The Péngulu of Yogyakarta explained to the Prince the meaning of this term as a wali who had two offices for God had given him the power to administer justice. As examples from Javanese history the PEngulu cited Sunan Giri, the great wali? of East Java who had founded the influential dynasty of priest, kings of Giri, and Sultan Agung (1613-1646), both of whom he asserted had held a double office and were beloved of God.'" This "double office" seems to refer to them in their capacities as wali's, spiritual men beloved of God, land as executors of Islamic law with temporal powers.
Thus Dipanagara later mentioned Sultan Agung as a "spiritual man who did as I did travelling around everywhere" and as a great Islamic ruler who had established the five

" pillars: of Islam."! In his Babad Dipanagara described



how the PEngulu's explanation caused him to reflect on

As far as the model of the walt's is concerned it seems alsmost certain that Dipanagara saw himself as being chosen as one of their number for some time later . occurred his vision of eight men led by one referred to as a "Panémbahan" (Pan¥mbahan Agéng Giri?) who read out a letter proclaiming him as Sultan Ngabdulkamit, Erucakra (Just King), Sayidin (Lord of the Faith), Panatagama (Regulator of religion), Kalifat Rasulullah (Caliph of the Prophet of God)."! The eight men can be equated with the eight wali's and their appearance implied that Dipanagara envisaged himself as being elected as the ninth, which was the traditional number of Islamic saints, usually referred to as the wal? sanga (the nine wali's) in The titles which were accorded him also indicated that Dipanagara saw himself as the head of the Islamic religion in Java, and, as all but the titles of Ngabdulkamit and Erucakra were already incorporated in the titles of the rulers of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, it was' later to be ostensible cause for the breakdown of the Magélang peace conference in March 1830 with

would be raised as a priest-king, and in another as a waliyullah (an apostle of God).©5 This would link the examples of the wali's very closely indeed With the Erucakra title, but there is no proof that Dipanagara himself understood this connection.

There is proof, however, that the example of the wali's remained important during the Java War and they are referred to often in Dipanagara's Babad. Thus Dipanagara's quarrel with Kyai Maja, according to the account given in the Babad, largely stemmed from Maja's attempt to challenge Dipanagara's supreme authority by dividing the administration into that of Ratu (King) , Wali (apostle of religion), Pandhita (one learned in the law) , and Mukmin {the believers). Maja suggested that Dipanagara should choose for himself one of these functions, implying that if he took that of Ratu, he, Maja, would be able to take that of Wali and enjoy undisputed religious authority. This Dipanagara refused to countenance saying that Maja wished to wield authority over him and drew a comparison between Maja and Sunan Giri, who according to Dipanagara had exercised power over the sultans of Dé&émak.°° Later when Dipanagara tried to

: It is possible to see in this long drawn out clash between Dlpanagara and Kyai Maja, which was eventually to lead to Maja's defection, an argument over who should wield supreme religious authority and in this the examples of the wali's and their forms of government were obviously considered as crucially important. It is interesting too that the family of Pangeran Serang, descendants of the famous wal? Sunan Kalijaga, commanded immense respect and attracted many followers to Dipanagara's cause early in the war. '' The position of Pangeran Serang, officially termed by the Dutch authorities as an onafhankelijk geestelijk Prins (independent spiritual Prince) , probably served as an example to Dipanagara and his followers, thus Pangeran Abdul Samsu, Dipanagara's younger brother, demanded to be recognized under just such a title after the Java War. "* Dipanagara, however, was aiming for something more,; for although Pangeran Serang had lands, he did not wield any religious authority outside them apart from the influence which the charisma of his name imparted. In the detailed account of Dipanagara's peace plans given in the letter of his army commander, Ali. Basah Pengalasan, it seems that he aimed to take some of the lands of Sala and Yogya and rule as an independent prince. The Dutch would be

'? These demands, if they had been acceded to, would have made Dipanagara a worthy successor of the walií's with powers rivalling even those of the priest-kings of Giri.

It seems likely that the example of Sultan Agung, the Javanese ruler who partially curbed the authority of the Giri rulers and could be regarded as having inherited the mantle of the wali's in terms of spiritual prestige, remained a major source of inspiration for Dipanagara. Thus his important meeting with the Ratu Adil occurred significantly on Mt. Rasamuni, a hill on the western abutments of the Gunung Kidul area, whlch had close traditional associations with Sultan Agung.
There is also some evidence that Dipanagara had connections with T&mbayat, the holy grave-site of Sunan Bayat, a place which had enjoyed close links with Sultan Agung during the latter part of his reign."" Thus a report submitted

and wisdom) of the King.'' Just as before the Java War Dipanagara had prepared himself in the manner of Arjuna

to receive the divine commands, so during the war by further long periods of solitary meditation and asceticism he was in a position to exercise the kawicaksanan of the Just King. These periods of retreat are a constantly recurring theme in Dipanagara's activities during the

war: thus even as early as the first month óf the war

a Dutch report mentioned that Dipanagara's followers

were building a wall the height of a man to enclose a garden retreat for the Prince at Again before the attack on Surakarta in October 1826, Dipanagara withdrew to meditate by the Sunan's pool at PEngging*'*' and during the mortal sickness of his wife, the Ratu Kédhaton, he meditated at a small padhepokan (ascetic's retreat) in the middle of the river near BanyumEéngng in the Kulon Praga area.

The picture which Dipanagara presented of himself in his Babad is that of the traditional Javanese pandhitaratu, taking part in temporal affairs but also withdrawing often for periods of retreat to seek divine guidance. The picture also has much in common with the Javanese view of the Erucakra who was seen in the light of a priest, klng who would strike awe into the hearts of his subjects.

The most important theme of all in Dipanagara 's Babad is almost certainly that of the Erucakra, the Javanese Messianic "Just King." It is difficult to ascertain exactly just how Dipanagara envisaged himself as fulfilling this role for direct, references are few, and there is significantly no mention at all in the historical introduction to his Babad of the first Pangeran Dipanagara who took the title of Sultan Erucakra early in the eighteenth century.? Nevertheless his vision of the Ratu Adil before the war and his assumption of the title of Sultan Erucakra on the lst Sura of the Javanese year Wawu, A.J. 1753 (15 August 1825), do suggest that he saw himself as the Just Indeed in the Surakarta Kraton Babad which will be discussed

- 29 fierce fighting around Kétangga in the Madiun area during the first year of the war, for the forest of Kétangga was regarded as the kraton of the Ratu Adil in Java.** Meanwhile the aim of the establishment of Islam as the agama kang suci (the pure religion), the driving out of the unbelievers (kafir's) and the installation of the new ruler as the Ratu Panétg Panatagama (the king who stands firm as the regulator of the religion), all of which were prominent in Dipanagara's rebellion, anticipated the strongly Islamic influenced expectations of the Ratu Adil which can be found later in the Malangyuda books.*' Then there was Dipanagara's wish both during and after the war to retire to live in Mecca, which not only indicated a desire to go on a pilgrimage (Haj), but also probably suggests that Dipanagara was conscious of the belief current in the Pralambang Jayabaya that the Ratu Adil had two kraton's, one in Java (usually Kétangga) and one in Arabia."! Furthermore there is evidence that on the promptings of Séntot (Ali Basah Prawiradirja), his most imaginative army commander, Dipanagara was contemplating conquests in eastern Indonesia, which would have fitted in again with the Jayabaya description in which rulers from overseas paid homage to the Ratu Adil. °°

The latter are merely suggestions but what does seem certain is the fact that Dipanagara was aware that he was not to be the leader to drive the Dutch from Java, but that he would be the cause of a short period of purifying destruction which would precede the age of just rule.""" Thus in his historical introduction, which was written admittedly ex post facto, the account which Dipanagara gave of Sultan Agung's prophecy after the failure of the siege of Batavia (1629), stated that the Dutch would rule for 300 years in Java and that although one of Agung's descendants would rise against them he would be The descendant envisaged by Sultan Agung is later clarified, for when Dipanagara's great-grandfather, Sultan Hamengkubuwana I (1749-1792) , saw Dipanagara as a baby in arms, he related that he would be greater than himself in fighting the Dutch,* but

The theme of Dipanagara as the means for precipitating a period of destruction is mentioned twice in visions and dreams related in the Babad, once before the English attack on the Yogyakarta Kraton in 1812, and again before the Java War.

104 There is the possibility that Dipanagara may have considered himself as the descendant of the Erucakra fram Turkey hence the Turkish names for his bodyguard regiments, and the meeting with the Ratu Adil to the east of the Opak, see also Ricklefs, "Inspirational Experience," but this would not fit with Dipanagara's views on the Dutch in Java.

although the text is not entlrely clear it seems to indicate that Dipanagara was to be the "means" for this destruction. "* In fact Dipanagara did play a crucial role later in

helping his father survive the intrigues of his grandfather, the second Sultan, and to ascend the throne as Sultan Haméngkubuwana III after the English attack. In a second stage of destruction, the Java War, the role which

Dipanagara was to play is made explicit by the vision of

the Ratu Adil who summoned him to lead his soldiers in

battle on the authority of the Koran. Devastation with a strong religious motive is envisaged with Dipanagara

as the prime mover, thus he referred to himself as

took the title of Sultan Erucakra at S&larong. 14% - The

sea of fire (samodra murub) and the thunderous noise which followed the Ratu Adil's order recalled the eruption of Mérapi in 1822 and further confirmed the coming destruction which would be wrought in Java. !'? Later in the Ratu Aging's dream about Dipanagara as a wal? wudhar, the voice which

she heard told her three times that unless her daughter-inlaw, the Ratu Kéncana, married Dipanagara, Java would be

According to Dutch reports Dipanagara did seem to have planned to start his campaign in 1825 with a destructive attack on Yogyakarta, which he had castigated earlier in his Babad for the failure of its inhabitants to follow Islam.'!* Later in the war, largely on the instigation of Kyai Maja, a similar attack was launched

on Surakarta, and both kraton's would have been curtailed according to the peace settlement proposed in Pangalasan's letter. ''' If he had been successful Dipanagara would then have ruled in Java as the Ratu Panét3g Panatagama, but as his aims were not admitted by the Dutch he sought instead permission to retire to Mecca in the manner of the Erucakra.



. Such in brief are some of the main themes in Babad which can perhaps afford useful insights into the

way he might have viewed himself and the events in which

he took part. The question of legitimacy and pamrth were central considerations to him as he wrote his Babad in

Menado and he sought to justify his rebellion in traditional Javanese cultural and cosmic terms. This does not of course gainsay the very important Islamic influences which are easily discernible in Dipanagara's career and in the Babad.
Thus Dipanagara's childhood and adolescence appear to have

Haji : Badarudin and Haji Hasan who were close advisers of Dipanagara during the war had been twice to Mecca (Knoerle, Journal ,.

- 36 Mecca cited in discussions amongst his religious advisers.} Never before in the history of Central Java had the formal trappings of the Islamic world been so much in evidence, but despite this, at least in his Babad, the basis of Dipanagara's weltanschauung still seems to have been

firmly grounded in the Hindu-Javanese traditions of the Central Javanese courts.''" Thus his period of preparation owed as much to the traditional Javanese conceptions of tirakat and to the model of Arjuna in the Wiwaha, as to the apprenticeship of a santri (a student of religion).

118 A balanced appraisal of Dipanagara's doctrinal position must await an analysis of other source materials, in particular the Makassar MSS., the most that can be said at this time is that Dipanagara reflected the fact that adherence to orthodox Islam was becoming an increasingly important part of the Javanese sense of cultural identity during this period.

deeply influenced by the traditional Javanese expectations of the Ratu Adil as by the teachings of the Koran, and his view of himself as the Ratu Panétég Panatagama drew much of its inspiration from the rule of the wal?'s in Java and of his ancestor Sultan Agung. Perhaps the best symbolic example of all of Dipanagara's attitude and behaviour was his own retreat at where he conducted his daily prayers to Mecca on six large yoni's dating from the Hindu period in Java:!'° the roots of Dipanagara's attitudes and aspirations lay firmly in

the Javanese past.

The Buku Kédhung Kébo



For Cakran&gara the central theme in the Buku is not, as in Dipanagara's Babad, to legitimize a rebellion, but rather to justify why he fought on the size of the Dutch against the Prince. In the early part of his account the picture which appears of Dipanagara is on the whole a favourable one in which his religious devotion is especially admired, although in the description of later scenes at the Surakarta court the involvement of the religious communities in political affairs is severely criticized.'*° Just how far Cakran&gara's own opinions are expressed in these passages is unclear, but this dichotomy in the attitude towards Dipanagara in the Buku has lent force to the theory that it was the work of two men, with PEngalasan contributing most to the early part, and Cakranégara inspiring the later passages which deal with Surakarta and the fighting in Bagélen.'*' There is, however, an oral tradition

119 See note 86.

120 Thus KITLV Or 13, XIV 35, p. 150, described the Surakarta Patih, R. Adip. Sasradiningrat II (1812-1846), as telling Sunan Pakubuwana VI:

35 saa 6 s vaags semu santri tan sagèd olah praja punika santri watéèke mung mbujéng awakipun.
boten sagéd mèngku prajadi santri rupék ing manah paes wahyu Ratu

121 See Carey, "Javanese Histories," p. 278.



in Java that both Dipanagara and Cakrangara studied under the same guru kZbatinan (teacher of spiritual disciplines) together before the Java War, and that the latter regarded the war as essentialiy a trial of (spiritual strength) between himself and the Prince.*** Indeed in Java the fact of having studied together under the same guru kébatinan often cccasions an exceptionally interse spiritual and personal bond between both teacher (guru) and pupils (murid) and amongst the pupils themselves.
Thus, this oral tradition could well provide a useful

key to an understanding of Cakranggara's attitude

towards Dipanagara in the Buku, in which, despite Dipanagara's great spiritual achievements, his ultimate failure and Cakranggara's decision to fight against him are ascribed by the author to a fatal flaw in Dipanagara's character and spiritual integrity. In the Buku, this attitude is once again postulated in traditional Javanese and cosmic terms, and three main themes can be singled out: firstly the description before the war of the

signs and portents received by Dipanagara, secondly after the outbreak of the war, the discussion of the Jayabaya prophecies with regard to the coming of the Ratu Adil,

and finally in the latter part of the Buku the wayang imagery used in the narrative.

The visions and portents received by Dipanagara in the early part of the Buku have already been the subject of a reasonably detailed analysis so that it is only necessary here to recapitulate the main episodes and their significance.'*'*" In 1823 Dipanagara is described in the Buku as disturbed by the deteriorating political situation in Yogyakarta, and in order to gain a clearer idea of the future, he dispatched his advisers on various journeys to holy sites in Central Java. First he sent his abdi dalZm, Kyai Jayamustapa, on a journey to Imagiri where he was instructed to meditate and do penance on the grave of Sultan Agung in the hope of receiving a sign.
Jayamustapa spent a night at the foot of Agung's grave with the jurukunct, Kyai Balad, and begged for a sign; the following morning he noticed a red spot the size of a plate on the curtains surrounding the grave. He asked

122 Ibid., the oral tradition was recounted to the present writer by Ibu Dr. Sahir, great-granddaughter of Pangeran Dipanagara II (Yogyakarta, May 1972).

123 See Forrester, Java War, Chapter III, "Signs and Portents: their Role in the Babad," pp. 43-73.







the jurukunet the meaning of the sign, and the latter replied that God had decreed that warfare would descend on Java and much blood would -be shed.. Jayamustapa then returned. to Tégalréja to report what he had seen and been told to Dipanagara, who understood its implication.
This initial sign as related in the Buku is interesting as it complements two of the themes which are important in Dipanagara's own Babad, the connection with Sultan Agung and the destruhtlveness of the war which would be unleashed by Dipanagara.

Dipanagara then sent Jayamustapa on another more extensive mission with three other companions, Kyai Janodin, his son Abukasan and Kyai Mopid from Guyangan.
The aim of this mission was to find the Wijaya Kusuma flower which was reputed to grow on the island of Nusakambangan opposite Cilacap on the south coast of Central Java. , The Wijaya Kusuma flower, the flower of Vlctory, was, according to tradition, sought in Java by claimants to the throne and if it could not be found this was interpreted as a Slgn that the pretender's claims were not legitimate, ' Dipanagara gave instructions that if Jayamustapa failed to find the flower, the party was to return northwards through and K&dhu and visit a number of holy places all the time seeking for signs. - Jayamustapa and his companions then departed for Cilacap, but when they arrived there they found that the cost of travelling by boat to Nusakambangan was too expensive, so they decided instead to make a shorter crossing to the stone mosque, MEsjid Watu, on another part of the island. They spent several days at the MZsjid Watu praying for the prosperity of Mataram and of D1panagara,rand one night Kyai Janodin had a dream in which Dipanagara was depicted as riding on the cow Gumarang (sapt Gumarang). The cow was as big as a hill and its feet were caught in the roots of a Balaran vine, but it broke loose and ran off carrying the Prince with it. No explanation of the dream is given in the Buku but it probably symbolized once again the destructive forces which would be unleashed in Java by Dipanagara.!'**

party returned to T&galr&ja and related the signs to Dipanagara who also received a message similar to the one given by Ki AgZng Sela which warned of the dangers of conceit (t¥kabur)' *" i> _ &

Such in brief are the main signs and portents which Dipanagara is depicted as having received before the outbreak of the Java War in the Buku, and in them Cakran¥gara revealed much of his personal attitude towards the Prince. The most important prophecy is that of Ki Agèng Sela for in it Cakranégara dealt with the question of pamrih. According to him, Dipanagara 's ultimate failure could be ascribed to the fact that his motives for rebellion were not pure but were affected by selfishness and personal ambition. Later in his description of the Prince at Slarong, Cakranégara related quite explicitly that Dipanagara was affected by conceit (kagépok tékabur) and had forgotten the warning given to him by the Almighty before the war. He thus incurred the wrath of God by his actions and was led astray by the arguments of Kyai Maja who urged him to proclaim himself Sultan at an unsuitable time.'! It

is possible to see in Cakran@gara's attitude towards Dipanagara, one of a fellow kZbattnan pupil who greatly admired the kas¥kten of his contemporary but nonetheless ascribed his failure to an inability to master his pamrih.
This fatal flaw in Dipanagara's spiritual integrity is confirmed in the wayang imagery used in the later passages of the Buku, in which the prince is equated with the Kurawa leader, Prabu Suyudana. It is also interesting

to note the very different traditions and beliefs cited by Cakranégara in his description of the signs and portents received by Dipanagara. Whereas Dipanagara in his wanderings described in his own Babad, mainly visited

the holy places associated with the spirit world of the Mataram area, Cakranégara drew his examples from his

home area of Bagelen and from Surakarta tradition. '*?
There was probably much too in Cakranégara's attitude which reflected the rival court tradition of Surakarta and the antipathy of a minor court official of Manecanagara origins for a member of the established court nobility.

In much the same way as he dismissed Dipanagara's claims to royalty, Cakran&gara also rejected the idea that the Prince was fulfilling the prophecy of the Ratu Adil. He thus described how many of the ordinary Javanese who followed the Prince believed that he was indeed carrying out the Jayabaya prophecy of the Ratu | Adil who would drive the Dutch from Java, but he asserted | that they did not realize that the time had not yet come i and none in fact understood the real meaning of the

- {4 Even more important than the discussion of the signs and of the Jayabaya prophecies in the Buku is the wayang imagery used in the latter part of the narrative. The importance of wayang symbolism is clear for on the leather covers of two of the oldest extant KZdhung Kb o MSS. wayang figures are used as decoration. Thus the Leiden University Library MS. (LOr 2163) has on the front cover, Bima on the right holding a club and Durna on the left, and on the back cover Suyudana and Baladewa.
Similarly the KZdhung KZ&bo MS. now in the Athenaeum Library (Deventer) has Bima and Yudistira on the front cover, and Suyudana and Baladewa on the back.'} The layout of the wayang figures suggests: a differentiation between the Pandhawa (Bima, Yudistira and Durna) and the Kurawa (Suyudana, and Baladewa). This would indicate that CakranEgara might have seen the war itself in terms of the Bratayuda, the final apocalyptic contest between the Pandhawa and the Kurawa in which after great loss of life the latter were finally defeated, and there is a reference in the Buku which confirms this viewpoint.'*' It is likely that Cakranégara saw himself as Bima, for in the Buku he compared himself with Raden Setyaki, who in the wayang purwa won the name of Bimakunting (the

Cakranégara compared the pericd to the gara-gara scene

in the wayang which was used especially in Surakarta wayang performance. It signified the temporary disturbance "

in the world order due to the strength of mind of a

powerful figure, a person of unusual stature, who finds himself in great grief and either consciously or unconsciously beseeches the help of the Gods to bring about a change in his situation, see Mangkoenagoro, "Wajang-koelit," p. 87,

136 See, Pigeaud, Literature of Java, Vol. II, p. 869.

137 Or 2163, XXXIX 3, p. 489, described Cakranégara as fighting like Gareng against nine men in the Bratayuda :

3 Ramening prang tambuh mungsuh lawan rowang panggrujuhe kang kanin lir Gareng kasanga ungkih agénti lawan samya sureng ingajurit lir Bratayuda Pöndhawa Kuraweki.





dwarf Bima) because of his great kas$kten.'** There

are also points of comparison between the career of Cakranégara in real life and that of Raden Setyaki in the wayang: thus both left their country of birth where they were assured of a position to win fame in a neighbouring kingdom. Cakran@gara left Bagélen where he had much local prestige as a descendant of kyaf's to take service in Surakarta, and Raden Setyaki left Lésanpura for the kingdom of Dwarawati. Likewise in the new capital both won for themselves a reputation as warriors, Cakranégara as a Surakarta commander fighting against Dipanagara in Bagelen, and Raden Setyaki in the Bratayuda. Their weapons were even somewhat similar for Cakranegara carried a pusaka pike, Kyai k&re, during the fighting in Bagelen, and Setyaki slew many of his enemies in the Bratayuda with his elub. !*?

As far as Durna and Yudistira are concerned there are no direct references in the Buku to them, but it is possible that they might have represented the Dutch.
In the wayang Durna was the powerful and mysterious guru of Bima who ostensibly tried to kill his pupil when he sent him on the quest to find the water of life at the bottom of the ocean, a quest which in fact turned out to be the highest point in Bima's spiritual enlightenment when he met with Dewa Ruci and returned with his full manhood name of Wrekudara.'*° It is possible that Cakranégara may have regarded such a man as Colonel Cleerens, the Dutch commander in Bagélen, in this light for it was under his guidance that he attained to the highest point in his career and was eventually recognized as the new Bupati in Purwaréja after the war. The figure of Yudistira which is depicted on the later Deventer MS.
was probably considered by Cakrangégara as a more flattering example for the Dutch Governor-General A.J. Duymaer van Twist (1851-1856) to whom the copy of the Buku was presented in 1852.

The figures 'of Baladewa and Suyudana are clearer and in the Buku refer to Sunan Pakubuwana VI (1823-1830) and Pangeran Dipanagara. Prabu Baladewa, the King of Madura in the wayang, was strongly sympathetic to the Kurawa cause, but because his great might have put the Pandhawa cause in jeopardy if he had fought against them, he was tricked by Prabu Krésna into meditating at Grogogan Sewu, and thus missed taking part in the Bratayuda. The figure of Prabu Baladewa was thus a suitable and flattering wayang figure with which to equate Sunan Pakubuwana VI, who, although strongly sympathetic to Dipanagara, took no direct part in the Java War. !"* Suyudana the eldést of the ninetynine Kurawa brothers in the Mahabharata was the king of Ngastina and a great ruler, yet fated to destroy himself and his house because of his own overweening vanity.
He was eventually killed during the Bratayuda by Bima himself who was informed by Prabu Krésna of a weak place on Suyudana's left thigh. This weakness, which derived from the fact that the place had been covered by a waringin leaf when Suyudana had been bathed in magic water (toya sèékti} as a young man, mlrrored the essential flaw in his character, his vanity. '"" So by equating him with Dipanagara, as Cakranégara had already pointed out in the discussion of the signs and portents, he implied that a potentially great ruler was brought to ruin by his own conceit. According to a modern commentator the lakon descrlblng Suyudana's end is to this day rarely performed in Java so great is the aura of tragedy which surrounds it.!"" The comparison between Dipanagara and Suyudana in the Buku was thus a fitting analogy for such a great figure and for the cataclysmic events with which he was involved.
By including these passages in his account Cakranégara was able at the same time to demonstrate his admiration for the Prince and to justify his actions against him during the Java War.

- 47 The Surakarta Kraton Babad .

There remains finally the Surakarta Kraton Babad which differs from the two major contemporary accounts of the Java War by the fact that it is merely a fragment of a much longer Kraton Babad. The complete Babad has almost certainly been lost, but even in the short introduction which is still available there are important passages which complement many of the themes discussed above. Once again wayang imagery plays an interesting role and many of the scenes were probably inspired by wayang wong performances observed by the Babad writer in the Surakarta Kraton. Thus the descrlptlon which is given in the Babad of the expressions on the faces of the Dutch officials in Yogyakarta when they heard of the resistance of Dipanagara at T&galr&ja, is drawn directly from those of the buta (giants) in the wayang wong:

When Mr. Smissaert and Chevallier heard it

they were exceedingly angry. They gnashed

their teeth and with

staring bloodshot eyes

they shook their heads

[and] their eyebrows bristled.'**

The Babad also seems to be unerringly exact in the

descriptions which it gives of the individuals

themselves. Thus the Yogya Resident, A.H. Smissaert (1823 €1 825) , who is described in a Dutch report as a "small, fat, shy man,"}*"*" is portrayed in much the

same terms in the Babad:

But the Babad writer apparently had no difficulty in reconciling this description with a previcus passage in which Dipanagara is portrayed as wearing the apparel of the Holy War.

Once again this could be said to reflect the strongly syncretic attitude of a member of the kraton community

in Java, an attitude, which, despite the uniqueness of his background and upbringing, Dipanagara seems to have

. shared in full measure.

The Surakarta Kraton Babad also includes the most explicit references to current expectations of the Ratu Adil and draws the closest comparison of any Babad account between Dipanagara and the Ratu 4dil. As the Babad is the most contemporaneous source available, it seems possible that these expectations were widespread at the time of Dipanagara's rebellion. Thus the description of the breakdown of society and morals in Yogyakarta before the outbreak of the war, although it is cast in

- 53 Then just before the outbreak of the war the Babad has a very explicit passage in which Dipanagara is depicted as taking council with his chief religious advisers about the exact time for the Ratu Adil to declare himself and the Holy War to be begun: '

is in this coming year

=: S4 The kitab mentioned is almost certainly the Musarar, which contained the prophecies which were divulged to the legendary King of Kediri, Prabu Jayabaya, by Maulana

Samsu Jen from Turkey.'*' The passage clearly shows that the belief that Dipanagara was fulfilling the Jayabaya prophecies was known in Surakarta, and as both the main Babad's also deal with this theme, it is possible to conclude that this belief was widespread in Java at the time.

Despite its fragmentary nature the Surakarta Kraton Babad thus contains many passages which provide useful insights into the way in which Dipanagara may have been viewed by a member of the Javanese court society at the time. As such it can be regarded as a useful foil to Dipanagara's own Babad which gives his own unique view about himself, and the Buku Kedhung KZbo which provides the view of one of his adversaries.

Conclusion

In all three of the Babad Dipanagara dealt with in this paper Javanese cultural particularities can be seen to form an important basis for an historical understanding of the authors and their viewpoints. Throughout imagery drawn from the wayang is used in the descriptions of the personnages and events of the Java War, and the use of these images transcend mere literary convention. Thus the fact that Dipanagara may have seen himself as Arjuna adds greatly to our knowledge about the man himself, and the wayang images used in the Buku confirm the views expressed by Cakranégara elsewhere, particularly in the

- pas§ages which deal with the signs and portents. . Even "in the Surakarta Kraton Babad the descriptions of the Dútch officials give an interesting insight. into the way 'ih which the Dutch were probably viewed at the time.
in the. early nineteenth century, "Especially the society of the kraton's; was so steeped in an understanding of the wayang, that it is possible to generalize that many Javanese then probably saw the war in terms of the Bratayuda and equated the Dutch with the buta figures 'in the wayang wong. '** So likewise many Javanese would have understood the implications of the Jayabaya prophecies, and Dipanagara's prestige amongst the Javanese peasantry was almost certainly enhanced by the belief that he was the Messiah who would institute a time of justice and plenty. Such expectations can also be linked closely with economic factors for from the viewpoint of the Javanese a time of economic and political decline, such as occurred before the Java War, was often associated with the prelude to the arrival of the Ratu Adil. An understanding of the implications of the Jayabaya prophecies can perhaps help also to place the Islamic influences at work in Javanese society at this time in their true perspective., Thus concepts such as the prang sabil and the Ratu Panatagama probably owed as much to traditional Javanese beliefs as to the influences of orthodox Islam, although they were later to become very nearly synonymous by the end of the nineteenth century.'"" The position of the Dutch in Java is dealt with in the two main Babad's and often the Jayabaya prophecies provided a basis to legitimize Dutch rule. Finally the passages in the Babad's which deal with the Javanese spirit world are crucial for an historical understanding of Javanese conceptions of power at that time. The justification and legitimization of rule and rebellion in Java have nearly always been expressed in cosmic terms. Thus the discussion of pamrih in the two main Babad accounts can be regarded as decisive, for on the one side it sought to provide justification for rebellion and on the other for opposition to that rebellion. The occult world of spirits and
