## Introduction

To say that the indigenous scholarly tradition concerned with the Old Javanese language was influenced by Indian linguistics is in fact an understatement. South Asia and the archipelago have been connected by cultural flows over at least the past 1600 years. There is little doubt that linguistic and language-philosophical notions developed on Indian soil encountered autochthonous ones. A process of selective and creative appropriation, analogous to that which took place in such other spheres as art, religion, mythology, and indeed language itself, must have spurred new ideas about language and discourse that were peculiar to Indonesia. Generally speaking, though, and especially if viewed out of cultural context, the thematics and modes of analysis of Old Javanese linguistics, as we know it, follow Indian models.

This is not surprising if one takes into account the objects of Old Javanese linguistic reflection. It was and is largely concerned not with morphology, syntax, and discourse structure, but with the lexicon and phonology and graphology, while a substantial part of the Old Javanese vocabulary and the entire system of its representation in writing happen to be of Indian provenance. Old Javanese linguistic thought was and remains directed above all to written genres, and the most prominent of these were originally modelled on ancient Indian forms. Examples are the kakawins, narrative and expository poems whose metrical system is that of the Sanskrit kāvyas, the parwas, prose renditions of the books of the Sanskrit Mahābhārata, the mantras, various kinds of prayers and ritual formulas, and the pras´astis, charters inscribed on stone and bronze. The thematic coverage of Old Javanese linguistics, then, is not of the same breadth as that of the plethora of classical Indian grammatical schools taken as a whole a circumstance that may itself indicate selective adoption and adaptation.

Reference was made to Old Javanese linguistics as we know it. It has been little studied and our knowledge of it is meagre. In this sketch of the state of scholarship we shall point out Indian counterparts or antecedents, but the focus is on Indonesian contexts. We conceive Old Javanese linguistics broadly, as the complex of cultural practices of analysing and reflecting upon the lingual repertoire and its use.

## ‘Old Javanese’

Old Javanese is an Austronesian language. First attested in a charter of 804 CE, it was pervaded by lexemes of Indian stock from the beginning of its recorded history. The source of the Indian vocabulary was Sanskrit. But while Sanskrit furnished a sizeable proportion of the lexicon some 20 to 30 per cent of running text, depending on the genre (Gonda 1973: 197204) it exerted hardly any influence on morphology and syntax. (Discourse organization has not been investigated.) Even the fact that the Old Javanese phonological system, unlike that of its nearest Austronesian siblings but analogous to Sanskrit, features retroflex stops contrasting with dental ones and long vowels beside short ones, is not necessarily due to borrowing. The retroflex stops and long vowels already occurred in non-Sanskrit words in the earliest texts (Gonda 1973: 579580; Zoetmulder 1974: 5759).

The label ‘Old Javanese’ is not without problems. The first concerns the association with Java and the Javanese that it suggests. Several of the lingual varieties that the term covers were used in original writing in Bali from around 1000 CE and later also in Lombok, by people who by all accounts did not consider themselves Javanese. Yet, linguistically Old Javanese is an ancestor of contemporary Javanese and not of Balinese. The second and more substantial problem relates to the adjective and is one of identification in time and space. There was no neat succession ‘Old’-‘Middle’-‘Modern’ Javanese. The genealogy and distribution of varieties remain so opaque that Zoetmulder, in his study of kakawins and parwas, felt compelled to lump together as Old Javanese all texts in Javanese lacking Arabic loans or Islamic influence (1974: 3536), a definition that yields a vast corpus of great internal heterogeneity, produced on several islands over twelve centuries. The term also easily obscures that some varieties are still alive. This is so in Bali more than in Java.

Used in scholarship, ritual, and narrative, Old Javanese is not spoken extempore save in certain dramatic genres in Bali. Its strong association with authoritative learning and inspired creativity is exemplified by the Balinese and Javanese terms that name it: basa kawi “kawi idiom” and  tĕmbuṅ kawi “kawi words”, in which the noun kawi (a Sanskrit loan) is the appellation of the eminent poets of ancient times. These terms also reveal a deep-rooted metalinguistic tendency. Language Old Javanese or otherwise is spoken of principally as vocabulary and its use.

## The forms of Old Javanese linguistics

We know the traditional study of Old Javanese from manuscripts written in Bali, Lombok, and Java, and from present-day folk linguistics in these islands. The surviving texts are about grammar, lexicography, and phonology and pertain to Sanskrit, Old Javanese, and their interrelations and commonalities. As noted above, their prime object is written language. Though Old Javanese and Sanskrit texts were read as song or chant, even the sound system is largely conceptualized in respect of writing. Mantras, for instance, are an oral genre, but they are highly text-oriented; witness the ritual importance of special symbols for vocables such as oṃ (Zurbuchen 1987: 5658; cf. Weck 1986: 79) and the fact that graphemic oppositions such as s-ṣ-ś, not phonemic today, remain significant in Balinese mantras (Staal 1995: 10).

The Kārakasaṅgraha is “[t]he only text so far published which answers the idea of a ‘grammar’ at least to some degree” (Schoterman 1981: 433; see also Gonda 1973: 183 184; Radicchi 1996). Composed in Sanskrit ślokas with Old Javanese translation and commentary, its topic is Sanskrit. It has three chapters. The first, the Kārakasaṅgraha proper, discusses the case endings, the second and third the compounds. Radicchi has argued that the Sanskrit text of the first chapter, which belongs to the grammatical school of Kātantra, was compiled around the 10th century in northern India and may have entered Java shortly afterwards. The other chapters were presumably added to it in Java, before it reached Bali, where all known manuscripts are from. The second chapter seems to be of Indian origin, the third not (Radicchi 1996). Beside the Kārakasaṅgraha, a few brief treatments of the declension of Sanskrit nouns and pronouns and fragments of verb paradigms have been found (Schoterman 1981: 436437).

The lexicon features in a wide range of works. The main type is called kṛtabhāṣā. Apparently short for Saṃskṛtabhāṣā “the Sanskrit language”, this is the generic name for dictionary-like texts that are mostly concerned with nouns and the proper names and epithets of deities and other classes of mythological beings (Juynboll 1911: 207215; Gonda 1973: 184185; Schoterman 1981: 424430; cf. Zurbuchen 1987: 102103). Each ‘entry’ is usually a list of synonymous words or alternative names in Sanskrit or Old Javanese (which, of course, often amounts to the same) followed by a definition in (Old) Javanese or Balinese. As in the Sanskrit kośas and modern thesauri, the entries tend to be grouped by cultural category: deities, dignitaries, animals, parts of the body, etc. Provided the reader knows his way around the text, he may use it to trace either the synonyms or their definitions. Some kṛtabhāṣās also list the meanings of homonymic or polysemous words again a pattern with Indian parallels. A special kind of kṛtabhāṣā is called Bhāṣā Ekalawya after its opening section, which presents a set of eleven triads of words with the same consonants but varying vowels, such as gara-giri-garu and sarasari-saru. Each word is glossed (Juynboll 1911: 206; Schoterman 1981: 430431; Zurbuchen 1987: 102). The purpose of this section is unknown.

Relatively much scholarly attention has gone to two compendia of linguistic and poetical texts. The Caṇḍakiraṇa, a copy of which was found in West Java, and the Caṇṭakaparwa, represented in manuscripts from Bali and Lombok, include kṛtabhāṣā sections, some of which they share in common (Juynboll 1907: 170-172; Juynboll 1911:219-222; Gonda 1973:185; Ensink 1967; Schoterman 1981: 421-427). The Caṇṭakaparwa also gives interpretive definitions that have somewhat misleadingly been described as etymologies. A word is dissected into segments, usually syllables, that are each identified as segments of other words, which serve to characterize and enhance the original word’s meaning. This approach to lexical semantics, also exemplified in other texts, has Indian roots. It is found, inter alia, in Vedic texts.

The main treatise on phonology, graphology, and orthography is the Swarawyañjana “Vowels and consonants”. It is devoted to the topics in its title and the rules of sandhi (Juynboll 1911: 216-219; Gonda 1973:181-183; Schoterman 1981: 431-433). Its terminology and order of treatment accord basically with Sanskrit theory, but Old Javanese examples are also given. Gonda judged that “the author has tried to explain Sanskrit by pointing to parallels in his own language and even to interpret the latter as if it were Sanskrit, to apply the Sanskrit rules to Javanese” (1973: 183), but the Swarawyañjana is not focused on either language. It calls itself a discussion of the “arrangement” or “life” of the characters of the syllabary (tiṅkahniṅ akṣara or huripniṅ akṣara) a syllabary that suits both languages.

These branches of Old Javanese linguistics played a role in several related domains of cultural theory and practice: composition, hermeneutics, and religio-philosophical speculation and ritual.

## Linguistics and the composition of texts

Knowledge of Sanskrit was of practical value to early writers, not only because of the origins of part of the Old Javanese lexicon, but even more because they quoted and paraphrased Sanskrit works in their prose narratives and treatises, and because they composed Sanskrit texts themselves. In some cases it has been possible to trace the Sanskrit quotations back to Indian exemplars, but the problem of the precise purposes of their inclusion in Old Javanese texts remains unsolved (Gonda 1973: 194-196; Zoetmulder 1974: 89-92). Sanskrit was occasionally used for inscriptions up to the 14th century CE (Gonda 1973: 180), and later, too, texts were written in a form of the language that has been labelled ‘archipelago Sanskrit’ and is often characterized as simplified or defective (Schoterman 1979). It is likely that authors used the linguistic treatises mentioned above, and others that have since been lost, as textbooks or reference works for writing Sanskrit.

The same applies to Old Javanese. The lexicons, the Swarawyañjana, and parts of the Kārakasaṅgraha must have been useful to authors of Old Javanese texts, the metrically and poetically exacting kakawins in particular (Gonda 1973: 185; Schoterman 1981: 435, 438; Radicchi 1996: 290; Creese 1998: 46 47). This is even more likely if one does not assume that Old Javanese linguistics was primarily concerned with Sanskrit. Save the pieces on case and inflection, the linguistic texts were relevant to Old Javanese as well. Treatises on poetics and prosody existed as further aids to composition (for introductions see Gonda 1973: 185187 and Zoetmulder 1974: 104109 on prosody; Creese 1998: 4649 on poetics).

# Linguistics and hermeneutics

The linguistic treatises seem also to have supported the interpretation of Old Javanese texts, rarely an easy undertaking due to their specialized format, uncommon idiom, and profound subject matter. This has been demonstrated for at least the kṛtabhāṣās. They were still used for the interpretation of kakawins in Bali in the 1970s (Schoterman 1981: 439). Schoterman has argued that some texts in the kṛtabhāṣā category must have been glossaries on particular works (1981: 428), and indeed Kuntara has identified a kṛtabhāṣā from Java which contains glosses on the Arjunawiwāha, an early-11th-century kakawin (1990: 206, 216). The interpretive freedom that the author allowed the users of his glossary is remarkable. He usually noted several lexical meanings for each word, like in the synonym lists from which he probably quoted, and not just the one meaning that he may have considered most appropriate.

## Religio-philosophical thought, ritual practice, and linguistic scholarship
Textual exegesis shades into the broader field of religio-philosophical thought on language and discourse. Interpretation was often metaphorical, as illustrated by a work titled Suksømabasa “The essence of idiom”. Applying the syllabic dissection technique found in the Caṇṭakaparwa, it expounds the covert philosophical meanings of words and names in two Old Javanese poems from Bali (Juynboll 1911: 216). Linguistic speculation infused rit ual practice, too. Like in Indian Śivaism and Tantric Buddhism, the elements of the syllabary were mantras associated with the limbs and other parts of the human body (e. g. Kats 1910: 5355, 102104). In Bali the imposition of the vowels and consonants on the body continues to be part of a Brahmin priest’s daily worship and other rituals (Hooykaas 1973: 122123; cf. Weck 1986: 6780; Zurbuchen 1987: 5556).

Perhaps due in part to an a priori assumption, there is a consensus among most contemporary scholars that the Old Javanese linguistic texts were practical manuals that served composition and interpretation, and as has become apparent, ritual too. No doubt they were, but there are indications that their study was also an end in itself. They were part of the scholarly heritage. Awareness of their contents contributed to personal enlightenment and could be displayed in various interactional contexts. For instance, Balinese puppeteers open a shadow play by reciting an exordium in which the Sanskrit/Old Javanese vowels and consonants are mentioned, as well as a number of phonological terms and the textual source of this information, the Caṇḍakiraṇa (Hooykaas 1973: 112 117; Zurbuchen 1987: ixx, 267268). Though in 19th century Java Old Javanese works were no longer composed and rarely studied, versions of the Swarawyañjana continued to be copied (Juynboll 1911: 218) and one was incorporated into the Cěṇṭini, the famous compendium of “all Javanese knowledge” (Wirawangsa with Ardja widjaja 1915: 85 89). As a final example, the syllabic dissection approach to lexical signification endures as a rhetorical device. In modern Java it is called keratabasa, a term that may derive from kṛtabhāṣā.

## Modern Javanese linguistics

Some Old Javanese linguistic thought, then, survived in Java. It mingled with notions from Arabic linguistics (→ Art. 50), which was studied in Islamic schools and could in part be projected onto Javanese. In the mid19th century, European scholars, probably working with Javanese colleagues, devised a new terminology for use in language textbooks.

It featured Sanskrit-derived and Sanskritized terms: wyakarana “grammar”, paramasastra “grammar”, dwiliṅga “duplicated”, etc. (Arps 1997). These European scholars knew about Sanskrit studies and, moreover, coined novel Javanese terms that were made to sound scholarly by being based on archaic words and morphemes, often of Sanskrit provenance. There was in most cases no direct line of transmission from Old Javanese linguistics.
