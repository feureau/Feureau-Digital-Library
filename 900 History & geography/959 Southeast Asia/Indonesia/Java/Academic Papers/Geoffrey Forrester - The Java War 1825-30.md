## Preface And Acknowledgements

The story of the Java War (1825-30) and of prince Dipanegara, who led the Javanese forces against the Dutch, has been recounted many times. Very full accounts are to be found in Bahasa Indonesia and Dutch, while brief but adequate summaries are to be found in English language works. The field would seem to be so thoroughly covered that further study could scarcely reveal anything else of interest. Yet one aspect of the Java War — the Javanese view - has been neglected, Few attempts have been made to understand Javanese attitudes to prince Dipanegara, the ‘causes of the war,and the Dutch. Yet the means for exploring Javanese attitudes have been readily available in the form of several babads (Javanese historical books) of the Java War.

In this work the author has attempted to discover how the period prior to the outbreak of the war, and the principal protagonist, Pangéran Dipanegara, were seen by contemporary Javanese. To do this, the Babad Dipanegara of the bupati of Purwaredja was used. The first nine cantos of this babad have provided an interesting and uniquely Javanese account of the events that led to the beginning of the war, as well as other important aspects of the war and Dipanegara's part in it.

From the value of the small excerpt of the babad used in this work, one can gauge the importance of the large number of babads that remain neglected. This work thus merely points the way to further studies of the babads of the Java War.

For their constant help in the preparation of this thesis I owe many thanks to the members of the Indonesian and Asian Studies Departments of the Australian National University. In particular, I will always be grateful to Professor A.H. Johns, Dr Sutjipto Wirjosuparto, Mr Supomo and Dr Soewito Santoso, all of whom have, over the past years, directed me through my studies of Indonesian history and Indonesian languages. Their scholarship and dedication have been a continuing inspiration to me.

There are many other people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude, and I feel that no list could ever be adequate. Yet I wish to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Dorothy Smith for her invaluable help in the final preparation of this work.

## Javanese Sources For The Java War

## A. Existing versions and MSS. of the Babad Dipanegara

Though Dutch scholars have often pointed to the usefulness of Javanese sources for a better understanding of the Java war, they have shown little enthusiasm for the preliminary task of translating and editing the many sources available. Still today there is no authoritative edition or translation of any of the many babads about Dipanegara. The two translations of babads that exist are incomplete and largely inaccessible. There are no translations into English.

The earliest interest in the babads about the Java War was shown by Taco Roorda who undertook the translation of the early parts of the babad that had been written by Tjakranegara, at that time bupati of Purwaredja. This babad was completed in 1843 and a copy was later presented to Governor-General Rochussen by Tjakranegara himself. This babad was important to the Dutch because the author had fought on their side during the Java War and had been rewarded for his bravery with the position of bupati: 

> "Kang mangké radèn dipati</br>
> pan sampun djinund jung deradjat kumpeni kang nglahiraké</br>
>tuwan besar ing Néderlan</br>
> wit sawabing luhur baga</br>
> saking “Fama miwah ibu</br>
> kasertan takdiring Allah."</br>[^1]

The scholar Winter had made earlier attempts to translate the babad, but its poor style and grammar deterred him. In 1860 Roorda continued his work and translated, together with notes, a portion of the babad.[^2] No romanized or Kawi text was included. This early work covers only the events leading up to the war, and its causes.

At about the same time the Batavia Society[^3] began to show an interest in another Babad Dipanegara which was reputed to be the work of Dipanegara himself, written in exile in Manado. There was doubt as to whether he actually wrote it himself or whether he commissioned poets to compose it, but the fact remained that it could be of considerable interest as it would have expressed Dipanegara's own ideas of the war and its causes. Therefore van der Valck was commissioned by the Batavia Society[^4] to translate the work but he completed only 91 pȧdȧs.[^5] For him the work was too unhistorical and the labour expended in translating its many pages would not be justified by the amount of historical fact to be extracted from it. It was also compared unfavourably with Tjakranegara's Babad which was already partly available in translation.[^6] The Batavia Society procrastinated for many years, refusing to make any further decision on Dipanegara's autobiography. However in 1870 it made a positive step towards finishing the translation begun by van der Valck:

> So as to do something, the Government placed an advertisement in the ‘Javasche Courant’ stating ‘Translators Required!’ There was no shortage of applicants, including inspectors of inland revenue and cultures, a commissioner of one of the departments of local government and a teacher. [^7]

All these applicants were assigned sections of the babad to translate and the collation and correction of these separate translations was undertaken by the 'controleur' Palmer van den Braek. When he had finally prepared a translation of the work in the year 1876, the Society again rejected it as being of no historical value. Since that time Palmer van den Broek's translation has remained in manuscript form.[^8] 

However the autobiography of Dipanegara continued to attract attention P.J.E. Louw, using Palmer van den Broek's translation in particular,[^8a] made a study of it when preparing volume one of his six volume De Java-Oorlog, 1825-1830. He wrote of this babad at the time:

> Unhesitatingly we would attribute such a high historical value to the Babad Dipanegara that any history of the Java War could undoubtedly be branded as highly incomplete if it had not, utilized the Babad Dipanegara as a source[^9]

Later in Surakarta in 1908-9, part of the babad was published in Javanese script.[^10] The work was without notes and much of the text, particularly those parts dealing with the early history of Java, was omitted.[^11] As recently as 1965, H.J. de Graaf has called for the publishing of this babad (and all Javanese historical writings), but it has remained largely neglected.[^12]

A third babad had attracted the interest of the scholar Hageman. This was a work in Malay by Aria Djajadiningrat, the regent of Karang Anjar.[^13] He had taken part in the war on the side of Dipanegara and his work would have made an interesting comparison with Tjakranegara's babad, Perhaps with this in mind Hageman prepared a translation of the work but this translation was lost! Since that time the original Malay MS. has lain, presumably untouched, in the old Batavia Society Library in Djakarta (now the Museum Pusat)[^14]

When Louw, Kemp[^15] and de Klerk[^16] began their major works in the 1890's they had access therefore to three Javanese sources in translation: the translation of the early parts of the Babad of Tjakranegara; Palmer van den Broek's translation of Dipanegara's autobiography; and the Babad by Aria Djajadiningrat. Louw and Kemp both resorted to Roorda's and van den Broek's translations and do not seem to have referred a great deal to the original Javanese works. Louw did translate, or had translated, a few passages of minor importance from Aria Djajadiningrat's work which is in Malay,[^17] but did not refer to this work very much at all, Thus while he (and Kemp) paid lip-service to the importance of the Javanese sources, they in fact had a very patchy knowledge of them and used only those parts available in Dutch translation.

One might have expected the obviously inadequate knowledge of the Javanese sources for the Java War to have spurred some scholars to publish and translate the babads in the years between 1900 and today. This has not been the case at all. Interest in Dipanegara has remained strong and has grown, at least in Indonesia, but no effort has been made to improve on the position that has prevailed since the days of Louw and Kemp. Scholars in the twentieth century have merely referred to Louw and Roorda if they felt in need of a Javanese source to corroborate their argument about some aspect of the war. This is particularly obvious in the works by Hallema (1936),[^18] van Praag (1947),[^19] Sagimun (1957)[^20] and van der Kroef (1958).[^21] Because they have used the same sources these works often are worded in a disturbingly similar way. Above all, no attempt has been made by any writer in this century to look critically at these sources they have borrowed wholesale from Louw and Roorda.

There is today a need for a total review of the Javanese sources available and a renewed attempt to translate and publish them for as wide a reading public as possible. In particular the publication of Pigeaud's catalogue[^22] of Javanese MSS. in the Library of the University of Leiden has revealed that there are now more than the three versions of the Babad Dipanegara that were known to Louw when he compiled his work. Moreover there are at least 20 MSS. of the Babad Dipanegara in Javanese, Malay and Dutch translation, in libraries in Holland and Djakarta.[^23] Pigeaud's catalogue has revealed the inadequacy of our knowledge of the sources. It is time to stop looking to Louw and Roorda for Javanese material and to seek it at its true source, the Javanese MSS. themselves. In the following pages the existing MSS. of the various versions of the ‘Babad Dipanegara’ will be described with notes on their possible usefulness for future studies.


### 1. General Histories of Javanese Kingdoms [^24]

Many of the voluminous histories of Mataram, Surakarta and Jogjakarta contain brief references to the Java War and Dipanegara e.g. LOR 2251, LOR 6408 a-b-c.[^25] The exact number that do refer to the war is not known. Such brief references are relatively unimportant and their utilization for the study of the Java War must await the extensive study of those works dealing exclusively with  Dipanegara and the war, the so-called 'Babad Dipanegara'.

### 2. Versions of the Babad Dipanegara

#### a. The version of Tjakranegara[^26]

This is the version partly translated by Roorda in 1860[^27] and also the version used by the present author in his study. Five MSS. of this babad are to be found in the Leiden Library: LOR 1823,[^28] 2115,[^29] 2163,[^30] and Dev. Ath. VI.[^31] Roorda compared Codices 2115 and 2163 only for his translation. The present author used a slightly different but incomplete version which is in the possession of the Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-Land en Volkenkunde, and its codex number is. KITLV OR 13.[^32] KITLV OR 13, though incomplete, nevertheless contains all the material covered by Roorda in his translation. Also the differences between it and the other four complete MSS. are slight.

In the collections in the Museum Pusat in Djakarta there would seem to be at least three MSS, (Nos. BG 117,[^33] c8/31,[^34], Br 113[^35]) of the Tjakranagara Babad. Thus there are eight MSS. of the Buku Kedung Kebo of which only three (L.Or 2115, 2163, and now KITLV OR 13) have so far been studied at all. There is an obvious need for at least a romanized edition of the complete Babad, with hopefully an English translation. This would be a formidable task, for the Buku Kedung Kebo is at. least 300 pages long in MS. form.

But the justification for such an editing is convincing. Here is a work by a Javanese contemporary of Dipanegara who was at the same time his opponent during the war. His views of Dipanegara would provide a useful comparison both with the views expressed by Dipanegara about himself in his autobiography and with the views of Tjakranegara's own Dutch companions in battle.

#### b. ‘Babad Dipanegara’ - the autobiography of Dipanegara 

There is one Javanese MS. of this babad in Dutch libraries: L.Or 6547 (in four volumes)[^11-1] in the Leiden Library. This is a copy made for Hazeu and the original is presumably still in Djakarta, where, there are at the moment three MSS. of this work - BG.282 and 283[^11-2] and Br.149.[11-3] A translation of this important babad was eventually prepared by Palmer van den Broek in 1876 but it was never published. MSS. of this translation are available in the Museum Pusat, Djakarta (BG 246,[^11-4] 315,[^11-5] 317[^11-6] at least one copy of it in the Netherlands, in the Instituut voor Taal - Land en Volkenkunde. This is MS. 589(a) ‘Babad Dipanegara’ which is referred to in de Graaf's Catalogue.[^11-7]

For those unable to procure either the original Javanese texts or the translation, portions of the translation appear in Louw (and his imitators).

Again there is an obvious need for a romanized edition of the work and the publishing of Palmer van den Broek's translation or an English revision of it. Again the size of the original makes this a difficult task but there is strong justification for such a move.

Originally the Batavia Society rejected the work for publication because it was too fantastic and unhistorical. In fact a third of the work is a partly non-factual history of the early kingdoms of Java, for Dipanegara had a keen appreciation of traditional history and the part he felt he had to play in it. Likewise his description of his own life and the events of the war must inevitably be coloured by personal bias and also by traditional concepts of mythology and religion. But this does not deny completely the historical value of the work. Dipanegara's autobiography is vital for an understanding of the War and why it eventuated, and its publication and translation will surely initiate more reasonable assessments of this period.

#### c. The Babad Dipanegara by the bupati of Karanganjar, Aria Djajadiningrat

There is only one copy of this MS. in the Museum Pusat, Djakarta, and this would seem to be BG 314[^12-1] the only Malay version of the Babad Dipanegara mentioned by Pigeaud in his Catalogue. Hageman's translation has been irretrievably lost.[^13-1]

This babad has been even more assiduously avoided than the former two babads, though Hageman seems to have attempted a translation. One difficulty may be the language, for though it is written in Malay many Javanese words and expressions are used which make both the Javanese and Malay sometimes incomprehensible. However, once again lack of interest seems to be the major cause for its neglect.

Aria Djajadiningrat fought on the side of Dipanegara. His work should therefore show why at least one Javanese deemed it worthwhile to fight for the prince. His general bias should also complement that of Diapanegara and contrast with that of Tjakranegara. Therefore this babad also deserves publishing and translation to further elucidate the Java War and Dipanegara's part in it.

These are the three different babads known to Louw in 1896 and commonly regarded since that time as the only Javanese sources available on the war. However, at least four other Javanese versions of the war have come to light during this century, and found their way into the Leiden Library.[^13-2]

#### d. Surakarta and Jogjakarta court versions of the Dipanegara troubles

There are four MSS. in this category. Nos. LOR 2114,[14-11] 6199 and 6200 represent the Surakarta tradition and the Yogya version is No. LOR 8603.[^14-12] LOR 2114 was written in 1825 and there are considerable differences with the Buku Kĕḍung Kĕbo. LOR 6199 and 6200 were both part of the Audemans collection presented to the Leiden Library in 1921, As Pigeaud has described them the end of 6199 corresponds to the beginning of 6200. L.Or. 8603 is dated 1867 and this particular copy was made in 1904. It was part of the collection of MSS. belonging to Dr Rinkes, bequeathed to the Leiden Library in 1954.

The contents of these four MSS, are completely unknown and should provide an interesting comparison to the three better known babads. All four babads seem to have been copied from MSS. in possession of court notables and this may point to their taking an anti-Dipanegara attitude. Confirmation or otherwise of this assertion must await their editing and translation.

#### e. Ali Basah's history of Dipanegara

Only one MS. is available of this version: LOR 8553.[^15-1] This history, written in Jogja and dated 1883, is supposed to have been written with information provided by Ali Basah, one of Dipanegara's captains in the war. If this is true (its editing and translation can verify this) then this version can add an interesting perspective to the others already known. It could be compared to Aria Djajadiningrat's Babad or fruitfully contrasted with Tjakranegara's. But this babad is as yet a closed book.

#### f.The Babad Dipanegaran Surja Ngalam

The codex number of this MS. is LOR 6488.[^15-2] It is a history of the Java War by Muhammad Arip. This work, part of the Hazeu collection, was apparently meant as an edifying work for the author's descendants. Its contents also are completely unknown.

#### g. The Djajabaja Babad Dipanegaran

This fragmentary version forms part of MS. No. NBS 37 pages 5-9.[^15-3] it is unfortunate that this MS. should be fragmentary and unfinished for it could have proved to be quite important to our study of Dipanegara's aims and motives. The babad begins with a mention of the Djajabaja prophecies which foretell the coming of the Messiah. It is interesting to see the prophecies mentioned in context with the Babad Dipanegaran for Dipanegara later took the Messianic title Erutjakra which is known from the Djajabaja prophecies. This version of the Babad Dipanegaran may therefore have given us some clue as to Dipanegara's relation with the Djajabaja prophecies. But it is unfinished and untranslated.

One final Javanese source has often been totally overlooked, This is the correspondence of Dipanegara. One can only guess at the nature of his correspondence and where to find it, let alone the number of letters he may have written. It is astonishing that no interest has been shown in this possible source which might have revealed intimate details of Dipanegara's life and given some insight into his most personal thoughts.

In fact only, two such letters have ever been published and translated.[^1] Here also much work remains in a field which could produce points of view quite different from those to be found in the specifically historical Javanese sources.

In the light of the above review, only one conclusion is possible. There is no justification for complacency about our knowledge of the Javanese sources for the Java War.

It has been shown that very little is in fact known about the three most famous versions of the Babad Dipanegara, upon which scholars in this century have most often relied. There are no authoritative editions of them and translations are either incomplete or inaccessible. Moreover, in this century four further versions have come to light but nothing is known of their contents. How can one properly write a history of the Java War when one is compelled to ignore the great volume of Javanese material awaiting scholarly analysis. There is no alternative put to undertake the massive task of editing, translating and publishing these works so that they can become accessible to large numbers of scholars and excite new interest in the field of Javanese history generally.

## B. Why use a Javanese source?

The controversy among historians of Southeast Asia regarding 'Europe-centric', 'Asia-centric' or 'Java-centric! perspectives has achieved some success in so far as it has forced historians to take more account of the indigenous historical sources available in their fields. Though the majority of the histories of Indonesia are still records of the Dutch in Indonesia and of limited interest to the student of the indigenous Societies,[^18-1] an increasing number of works have consciously set out to see events and periods through Indonesian or Javanese eyes. These studies have confirmed that beneath the veneer of the Netherlands East Indies, indigenous societies remained viable and functioning.[^18-2]

The period of the Java War has been studied almost exclusively. from the Dutch or Western perspective,[^18-3] and in academic and populist works the war has come to be regarded as an epoch in the history of the extension of Dutch power in the Indies. In brief, it is depicted as the Dutch victory which brought Java to her knees and assured the Dutch of pre-eminence in the Archipelago. Some have even characterized the war as a salutory lesson to the Javanese after which they gave up Islamic fanaticism and debilitating wars, and took on modern ways and the task of filling the Netherlands' treasury. Such an extreme 'Europe-centric' view has developed because the only sources properly analysed and readily available have been Western sources. The neglect of Javanese sources is to be deplored particularly in view of the number of babads that were written. If the Javanese held the war to be sufficiently important to produce several histories of it, their views may well have some bearing on assessments of it. This study of Tjakranegara's babad has confirmed that the Javanese had distinct and valuable opinions to offer about the war. These opinions, with proper analysis, would have been of interest to the nineteenth century scholars who first established a view of the war. It is true that the Javanese perspective in Tjakranegara's babad is blurred by traditional motifs and the intrusion of myth and its merging with fact.[^19-1] However, with careful analysis, it has provided a formulation of a Javanese view of the war.

The establishing of distinct Dutch and Javanese views should not be an end in itself. Rather, in the comparing and reconciliation of the two views there should emerge an assessment which, because it takes account of all sides, is more accurate and therefore more authoritative.

There is an urgent need for a balanced view of the Java war, The 'Europe-centric' view has tended to emphasise the role of the Dutch military and thereby to neglect the fact that the war was fought by Dipanegara principally against the Jogja court. It will be shown that the war had its origins in a bitter conflict for supremacy between the 'patih' of Jogja, Danuredja, and Dipanegara.[^20-1] This view of the origins of the war suggested by Tjakranegara, emphasises Javanese motives for forcing this personal conflict to a violent denouement, thereby removing the Dutch to the periphery of events. In the Dutch conception, their armed forces intervened to defend their interests in Java. According to the Javanese view, the Dutch were embroiled in the conflict by the wily Danuredja who used them to attain his aim of eliminating Dipanegara.

Much has been written by Western scholars on the causes of the war, and a number of factors have been referred to as interacting to bring about the war.

=====================================================

 In particular the Dutch have pointed to economic causes, including the cancellation of land rentals by Governor-General van der

toll-gate proprietors.' It is understandable that economics should loom so large in the Dutch perspective of events in

Indonesia for money-making was their principal purpose in

1 Those who have speculated on the causes of the war include:

(i) Those who wrote during, or just after, the war: Those who wrote at this time often did so for self-preservation (Governor-General van der Capellen, Smissaert) while others speculated on causes in order to bring the incumbent administration down and replace them (Nahuys,. de Salis, Mac.Gillavry, van Sevenhoven). The Commissioner-General, du Bus de Gisignies, who arrived in Java in 1826 to investigate the causes of the war also cast a wide net. See P.H. van der Kemp, 'Dipanegara, een Geschiedkundige Hamlettype!, BKI (1896), pp.278-433.

maintaining colonies. For Tjakranegara neglect of the sawahs and dwindling commerce were signs of the impending destruction of the kingdom and not indicators of economic mismanagement. Moreover he makes no mention at all of the Chinese exactions nor of the cancellation of land rental,

and he only briefly refers to ‘the cession of lands to the

Dutch. 3

The Dutch also considered as causes Dipanegara's ambitions on the throne and his bitterness towards the court and the resident when these ambitions were thwarted; his religious fanaticism; and his weak character. Tjakranegara on the contrary continually emphasised

Dipanegara's disinterest in the throne.” Tjakranegara does

 

1 This was particularly the policy of the Company (v.0.C.), but the profit motive remained even after the disbandment of the Company in 1795: In its report the Commission (of 1803) stipulated that all colonies existed for the benefit of the Mother Country. This was a maxim to which even the most progressive persons of these days would not object. F, van Welderen Rengers, op.cit., p.16. 2 See further Chapter III. 3 See Canto IV, v.70, and relevant section of the Summary. 4 Van der Kemp provides the following list of Dipanegara's character traits (as he saw them): innate melancholia; desire for rejection of society and women; suicidal tendencies; inertia; passivity; sarcasm; capacity for sudden bursts of anger; irritability; tendency to be domineering; susceptibility to hallucinations; insanity. See P.H. van der Kemp, 'Dipanegara, een Geschiedkundige Hamlettype', BKI (1896), pp.283-433. 5 = Canto I, v.17-31; Canto II, v.20; Canto IIT, v.54-6. 

23

state that the patih and Queen Mother often tried to persuade the Resident that Dipanegara did covet the throne. This may well be the source for the Dutch insistence on Dipanegara's ambition. With respect to Dipanegara's ‘religious fanaticism’, Tjakranegara as a Muslim himself admired the prince's religiosity (though he once playfully criticized some of his excesses),

The Dutch views on the causes of the war have been expounded at considerable length over the last 140 years and their perspective has moulded the conception of the Java War which is generally accepted today. This conception is unfavourable to Dipanegara,” and it tends rather naturally to overplay the Dutch role. The babad of Tjakranegara provides a balance. It is not biased in favour of Dipanegara, In fact, it states unequivocally that Dipanegara's cause must fail. Yet Tjakranegara does paint a sympathetic picture of the prince and we may assume that many Javanese shared the same view. The Dutch moreover are removed to the periphery of events in the babad. For

1 Canto IV, v.41-5. See also Chapter III, 2 . . The obvious exception to this is the group of post-1915 Indonesian histories (see above). Because Dipanegara fought the Dutch, and because Dutch comment on him has generally been unfavourable, the feudal prince, who may have had little time for the ideas of Pantjasila,has been turned into a pahlawan (hero) and a fighter for Indonesian nationalism before it even existed. These works have not based themselves on indigenous sources as might have been expected and are no more than a rewriting or 'retooling! of the Dutch sources. ; 3

See Chapter LIl, ‘Signs and Portents in the Babad'.

Tjakranegara the only vestiges of Dutch power are the 'Residèen! in his rLoaji',* far away 1 Semarang! 2 and even further away the 'Gubenur Djendral ing Batawijah'> and his 'Rateni'." In short the whole feeling of the babad | suggests the remoteness of the Dutch power. The babad also suggests that the Resident had no sweeping powers, and functioned not as a law-giver but merely as the envoy of a foreign country to its vassal state. The residents gave

their assent. - they never gave orders. With Dutch power

placed in this new perspective, Tjakranegara developed his

concept of the origins of the war. As he saw it, the war grew out of the conflict of the patih Danuredja and the senior prince of the kingdom, Dipanegara. In the past. princes and ministers had fought for supremacy on many occasions and in the eyes of Tjakranegara this fresh struggle must have fitted easily into the pattern that was familiar from the past.

This Javanese concept of the war was moulded by the

Javanese world view and picture of the past, and taken on

its own it gives a valuable insight into these two facets of Javanese society. In conjunction with the Dutch views,

it will enable a more balanced assessment of the war and

its origins to be made. The achieving of a more balanced

and representative assessment is a compelling reason for

making more use of the indigenous Javanese sources.

| | 26 CHAPTER II

A HISTORY OF THE MATARAM AND JOGJAKARTA PERIOD FROM ITS BEGINNING CIRCA 1575 A.D. UNTIL 1822 A.D}

In the second half of the sixteenth century a certain Ki Gedé Mataram was given the district of Mataram in Central Java by his master, the Sultan of Pajang, in return for having killed a rival of the sultan. Ki Gedé Mataram established a settlement at Kuga Gedé, which was at that time still barren and deserted. People came to settle there and his settlement began to prosper.” This was the modest

beginning of the powerful Mataram dynasty.

Ennis very brief history of the Mataram period has been included to provide a historical background to the present study. Dipanegara as an heir of Sultan Agung and Senapati

was aware of, and influenced by, the deeds of his forebears. A proper understanding of Dipanegara and the political atmosphere of early ninteenth century Java therefore requires an appreciation of the history of Central and East Java during the whole Mataram period, which includes Jogja and Surakarta. It is important to realise that for Javanese in the early 1800's 'Mataram! still existed in the form of Solo and Jogja. (Tjakranegara repeatedly refers to Jogja as 'Mataram'). 1822 A.D. is the date of the accession of Sultan Ménol of Jogja, Dipanegara's nephew. The years 1822-5 are covered in the

chapter describing events leading up to the outbreak of war.

The idea that a 'man of destiny! like Ki Gedé Mataram could

build a new state in a jungle wilderness and’attract a population because of his generoisty or kasektèn (supernatural powers) was very popular among the Javanese, It appears in the Pararaton whereWidjaja sets up the kingdom of Majapahit in the forest of the Trik people (J, Brandes, Pararaton, revised ed. 1920, pp.118-9) . It is also to be found in popular works, e.g. the 'Hikajat Pandji Semirang', Balai Pustaka, 1953, p.48: 'many people from the neighbouring country of Kuripan came to the country of Kelana Pandji Semirang and became its citizens, so that the country prospered!', This tradition finds a practical explanation in the fact that while Java's population was still small the citizens of one state who were being sorely pressed by their ruler, could easily move into a deserted area not under his jurisdiction. Here they would come under the protection of an energetic and- ambitious man who could eventually challenge the old king. In this he would be backed by the resources of the refugees who had gathered around him.

‘In about the year 1575 Ki Gedé died and he was succeeded by his son Sénapati, It was Sénapati who bore the first fruits of the prophecy that the descendants of Ki Gede would rule all Java. He developed a power base in Kuta Gede and defeated the Sultan of Pajang. By subduing Surabaja and Bast Java, he established the pre-eminence of Mataram, |

Sénapati died in 1601 and was succeeded by his son Panembahan Krap jak,” who ruled until 1613. Panembahan: Krapjak was succeeded in 1613 by his son Raden Mas Rangsang. “The latter, better known by his posthumous title Sultan Agung,” extended the power of Mataram over most of Java. Surabaja, Gresik, Madura, Giri and Tjeribon were all subdued.

Only Bantam and the extreme East did not recognize the

 

suzerainty of Mataram. In 1629 Sultan Agung unsuccessfully challenged the Dutch by laying siege to Batavia. Sultan

Agung had an ambivalent attitude towards Islam, He took the

His full posthumous title was Panembahan Séda-ing-Krapjak (the lord who died in the hunting field),

2

Sultan Agung did not immediately succeed to the throne. A younger brother, radén Marta Pura, ascended the throne, but. for a very short time only. See H.J. de Graaf, 'Regering van Sultan Agung', opecit., p.26.

3

When he first acceded to the throne he had the title Prabu Anjakrakusuma (Tjakrakusuma).This title has been preserved in babads and other traditional writing, erg. the Djajabaja predictions. See further Chapter IV. In 1624 he took the title 'Susuhunant (the lord who is carried on the head). This title has been preserved in Surakarta, In 1641 he acguired the title of Sultan from Mecca. In full his new title was 'Sultan Abdul Muhammad Maulana Materani'. His posthumous title Sultan Agung 'The Great Sultan' derives from this Islamic title acquired from Mecca. 

28

Islamic title of Sultan, and in several ways expressed support for Islam." However he did not convert Mataram into a Muslim state and the interior of Java retained its Hindu-Buddhist aspect. Sultan Agung died in 1645 and he was buried at Imagiri, a mountain-top not far from his kraton of Karta. Since that time Imagiri has been used as the burial place for the kings of Mataram, Jogja and Solo. His son succeeded him with the title Amangkurat IT. He was a particularly cruel king, slaughtering 5,000 muslims who had assembled in the alun-alun of the palace.” In 1674 a serious rebellion broke out in East Java under the leadership of Trunadjaja, a Madurese prince, He captured most of East Java and established his kraton in Kediri. In 1676 (the Javanese year 1600) Trunadjaja attacked Mataram

itself and captured it. European histories usually claim

 

T E.g. in 1633 he made a trip to Tembajat, the burial place of the wali Ki Pandan Arang and an important Muslim centre. After this he announced that the Saka era (ive, the era beginning A.D. 78) would be retained, but the solar year of 365 days would be replaced by the’ Islamic lunar year of 354-5 days. This is the origin of the unique Javanese calendar.

2

The cruelty of a king is often a sign of the impending downfall of the kingdom. This is certainly true of the account of Sunan Djarot in the Babad Dipanegara (see Canto III). In the context of Amangkurat I's reign it must be remembered that agcording to tradition the kingdom of Mataram was to end in the Javanese year 1600 (1676 A.D.) Le@e during the reign of Amangkurat I. (see further Chapter IV and Babad Tanah Djawi, opecite, p.168). Thus the cruelty of Amangkurat I may be no more than a fiction devised by the Javanese writer of the Babad to reinforce the view that Mataram was destined to end in the near future .

 

 

29

that Amangkurat was driven from his kraton: 'Trunadjaja, profiting by the Dutch half-measures, stormed and sacked

the kraton of Mataram, and Amangkurat, fleeing to place himself under Dutch protection, died at Tegalwangi' The Babad Tanah Djawi however states that Amangkurat left the kraton willingly, knowing that it was God's will that Mataram, because it had already lasted 100 years? should now be replaced by another kingdom,”

Amangkurat having left Mataram died soon after at Tegalwangi. His son!s claims however were taken up by the Dutch and by 1677 they had captured Kediri and soon after Trunadjaja himself. The son of Amangkurat was therefore crowned as susuhunan and took the title Amangkurat rr. The new king constructed a new capital at Kartasura. Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was succeeded by his son who took the title Amangkurat III, He also is depicted as a bloodthirsty tyrant, but in view of Pangeran Puger's impending usurpation, the king's cruelty may have been no more than the babad writer's fiction designed to make the fall of Amangkurat III seem presaged by fate.

1 According to the Babad Tanah Djawi (p.260) Pangéran Puger had already been given the right to rule Kartasura, for he had received the wahju (royal lustre) from the former king Amangkurat II, In traditional terms the Babad Tanah Djawi also related how Pangeran Puger obtained the assistance of the Dutch in his usurpation of the throne: The Governor-General in Batavia discussed with his councillors what should be done about the accession of Amangkurat III to the throne of Surakarta. They advised that the tenung Welanda (Dutch wizard) should be hired to Kill the new king. He had killed several kings in other countries. .He was therefore hired and sent to Kartasura. Arriving at the palace he appeared before the king in the middle of the night and said to him: ‘IT am the tenung Welanda; are. you the king of Java?! The king was so terrified by the horrible sight of the wizard that he replied: _ IT am not the king. The king of Java is my uncle who lives in the Kapugeran (Residence of the prince Puger), to the north of here!l. The wizard then went to the house of Pangéran Puger, who when told that Mangkurat IIT had said that he was king accepted it graciously. Pangeran Puger then pitted his magical powers against those of the wizard, whom he turned into a dwarf. The wizard returned to Batavia. In this way the author of the Babad showed how Pangéran Puger was accepted as king by the Dutch, because Mangkurat III had stated this to the envoy of Batavia, the wizard. The author also made it clear that Puger was not to be considered a puppet of the Dutch, by making Puger's magic stronger than that of the wizard.

and Kartasura. Semarang was relieved by Dutch reinforcements, but Kartasura was overrun and Pakubuwana IT forced to evacuate the kraton. The rebels proclaimed a grandson of Amangkurat ttt susuhunan. The Dutch however defeated the rebels and reinstated Pakubuwana IL, who then had to make great concessions to the Dutch. He ceded. the North Coast to the Dutch and gave up his claims to the ‘island of Madura.” Because the old kraton had been defiled by the Chinese rebels, Pakubuwana II built a new capital at Surakarta.

The Madurese had greatly assisted the Dutch during this rebellion, in the hope of gaining their independence. However when peace returned in 1743; the Madurese found themselves under Dutch ‘protection!, Under ‘their leader Tjakraningrat IV they also rebelled and it took another two years for the Dutch to restore peace in Java.

However it must be. remembered that Mataram still controlled most of Central Java and retained its claims in East Java.

had promulgated that whoever captured the rebels Raden Mas Said” and Martapura,” would be given the district of Sukawati. Mangkubumi was able to guell the rebellion and destroy its forces, but Mas Said and Martapura escaped. Though Mangkubumi had achieved a great deal of success, Pakubuwana, at the suggestion of his jealous patih Pringgalaja, did not reward him with Sukawati and gave him instead 1,000 tjatjahs of land. Mangkubumi could in no way get satisfaction from the king, and so on the 19 May. 1746 he left Surakarta and went to Sukawati, where he joined forces with Mas Said and Martapura. The Dutch supported Pakubuwana II against the rebels. This war continued for nine years and Mangkubumi and his allies were able to inflict several defeats on the Dutch.

protection of the Company." By 1754 the Dutch had realized however that they were close to defeat and determined in consultation with Pakubuwana III to come to terms with Mangkubumi by dividing the kingdom.” Thus by the treaty of Gianti, concluded on 13 February 1755, the kingdom of Mataram was divided into two halves, Pakubuwana ILL retained the capital Surakarta and his domain included the eastern portions of the kingdom, Mangkubumi received the southern and western portions and he set up a new

capital which he called Ngajogjakarta Adiningrat.? Mas

1

The Javanese and Dutch texts of this agreement are to be found in Soekanto, op.cit., pp.178-81. The agreement was 'controversial!', because it was taken by some to mean that Mataram had been given outright to the Dutch. This was not in fact the case, It was placed under Dutch protection, in the same way that the Crown Prince was placed under their protection. It is interesting to note that the legal and administrative status of Mataram did not change as a result of this agreement. Jogja and Surakarta were not incorporated in the directly governed territories, and retained their territorial identity and independent government, The presence of residents in the two principalities suggests that they were under the protection of the Netherlands, and not possessions as some have claimed from a reading of this agreement (see G.J. Resink, Indonesia's History between the Myths, op.cit.).

2 8

The same offer of an independent territory to govern was made to Dipanegara when he met with General de Kock in Magelang in March 1830. De Kock discussed with Dipanegara how much territory he wanted, and promised that he would be an independent prince like the Mangkunegara and the Paku Alam. Dipanegara is reported to have refused, claiming that he wanted to be recognized as Head of the Islamic religion in Java. See P.H. van der Kemp, 'Dipanegara een Geschiedkundige Hamlettype', op.cite, pp.!26-7.

Ngajogjakarta, the original form of the name of Mangkubumi's capital (it is to be found in Tjakranegara's babad) is probably a Javanese corruption of the Sanskrit Ayodhya, the mythical capital of Rama, the hero of the Ramayana. Thus Mangkubumi's capital was linked with the illustrious capital of Rama.

Said continued to fight the Dutch until on 24 February 1757 he surrendered to the susuhunan of Surakarta. By the treaty of Salatiga Mas Said was given territory which he could govern as an independent principality. This territory which was, ceded by Surakarta was termed the Mangkunegaran, and

Mas Said and his successors were the Mangkunegara princes.

The History of Jogjakarta

On his accession to the throne of Jogja, Mangkubumi | took the title Sultan” Hamengku Buwana I. He also appointed temenggung Judanegara his patih (prime minister) and he gave him the name Danuredja, which was later taken by all the patihs of Jogja. The treaties of Gianti and Salatiga brought peace to Central Java and the reign of Sultan Hamengku Buwana I was peaceful, He died in 1792 and was succeeded by his son who took the title Hamengku Buwana II, and who is also known by his posthumous name of Sultan Sepuh or the 'old Sultan'. Sultan Sepuh's reign was difficult in view of the increasing Dutch pressure on the independent kingdoms of Java. The conflict between the Dutch and the Javanese rulers was exacerbated by the appointment of Williams Daendels as Governor-General. He arrived in Java in 1808, the representative of Louis Bonaparte, king of the Netherlands, with orders to fortify 1 The kings of Jogja used the title of Sultan which had not been used since Sultan Agung acguired it from Mecca in

1641, The kings of Surakarta retained the title of Susuhunan . . 

36

Java against the British. Daendels did much to alienate and cause anxiety to Sultan Sepuh. In 1808 he led an army into Bantam, deposed its Sultan and incorporated it in the territory of the Netherlands. He also established new | regulations for ceremonial in the principalities whereby Dutch officials no longer had to pay due respect to the rulers. Anxiety about Dutch intentions towards Jogja led to the creation of two opposing cliques within the court. Sultan Sepuh allied himself with the princes Natakusuma, Natadiningrat (the former's son) and Raden Rangga Prawiradirdja III, the bupati of Madiun and overseer of the Mant janegara. This group was firmly opposed to the further extension of Dutch power into Jogja. Allied to the interests of the Dutch were the Crown Prince Pangéran Adipati Anom,” and the patih Danuredja 11.3

In February 1810 Daendels heard that Radén Rangga had burned and plundered the villages of Ngebel and Sekedok in Surakarta. Immediately he ordered Sultan Sepuh to | surrender Radèn Rangga for punishment, Sultan Sepuh hesitated and replaced Danuredja II with the anti-Dutch

Natadiningrat. Daendels however inisisted that Danuredja

be re-installed and on 12 Novembr 1810 this order was carried oute Radèn Rangga's departure for Bogor was set for 26 November 1810. Radèn Rangga however left the kraton secretly on 20 November and began a rebellion in the

Mant janegarae Daendels, hearing of the rebellion, called on Sepuh to arrest Natakusuma and Natadiningrat who were implicated in the rebellion. Sepuh was forced to comply with this demand.

In December 1810 Radén Rangga was killed and peace returned to the Mant janegara. Daendels used this occasion to go personally to Jogja and on 28 December he deposed Sultan Sepuh and made the Crown Prince king, with the title Kangdjeng Sultan Mataram.

Events. however were moving very guickly in Batavia.

On 16 May 1811 Daendels was recalled and he was replaced by Janssens. In August 1811 the British landed in Java and on 18 September the Dutch surrendered to the British. Immediately Sultan Sepuh resumed the throne and his son became Crown Prince again. Sepuh murdered his principal enemy Danuredja II in October,” and replaced him with the candidate of his own choice, Sindunegara, Having regained his throne Sepuh began to plot with the susuhunan and make

plans to eliminate the power of the English from Java.

 

1

This is referred to in passing in Tjakranegara's Babad. In Canto IL verse 27, he refers to the wife of Sultan Djarot (Dipanegara's brother) as the daughter of the patih Danuredja, who ‘died in the palace, murdered by the king’.

 

 

38

The resident John Crawfurd reported the intentions of Sepuh to the new Governor of Java, Thomas Stamford Raffles." Raffles moved guickly and entering Jogjakarta in June 1812 with an army of 1,200 men he deposed Sultan Sepuh and reinstated the Crown Prince. The old king was banished to Penang island, and the Crown Prince was installed on 28 June, taking the title Hamengku Buwana rr. The new king, better known as Sultan Radja, had to pay dearly for the English assistance. Pangéran Natukusuma was made an independent prince with the title Paku Alam and he was given 4,000 tjatjahs of land. All of Sepuh's treasury was taken by the English. Sultan Radja also gave up lands in Kedu, Patjitan, Djapan, Djipan and

Grobogan. Tjakranegara describes how Sultan Radja came to

Tjakranegara's babad begins with the banishing of Sultan Sepuh. In Canto I, verse 13, he describes how, as a result of a devastating storm (the arrival of the English), the king of Djogja was exiled: | ing Ajogja sang akatong kabur binuwang ing sabrang : I, 13, Ce — d. the king of Ajogja (Jogja) was forced into exile abroad.

It seems that prince Dipanegara played an important part both in the appointing of the new patih and in the accession to the throne of his father, Sultan Radja. European sources agree that Dipanegara negotiated with the English resident to have his father placed on the throne, after Sepuh had killed the patih Danuredja II and seemed to threaten his own son, the

Crown Prince, too. In return for his assistance to the

English and the Mant janegara lands in Kedu and other lands were requested by the English. . We should note that Tjakranegara fails to distinguish between the Dutch and English, always referring to the latter as. 'Welanda', i.e. Dutch. This indicates how vague the notions

held even by sophisticated Javanese were about” things European. 2

English and to his father Dipanegara is supposed to have been offered the position of Crown Prince, This however he refused:

Let us look at the situation in Jogja (in early

1812). The English wish Dipanegara, in return

for his services in the war against his

grandfather Sepuh, to be named Crown Prince,

while his fatherRadja becomes Sultan, He

‘hesitates however because he does not wish to

usurp the morally stronger claims of his

brother Djarot'. 1

Tjakranegara .corroborates the European sources. In Canto I. he relates how Sultan Radja offered to make

| 2

Dipanegara Crown Prince, as he had already promised to dog This promise was presumably made when his father came to the throne. Dipanegara refused his father's offer, because his brother Djarot, as the son of the chief queen, had a stronger claim to the throne.” Tjakranegara also states that Dipane gara had Radén Temenggung Sumadipura appointed as Danuredja IV in 1812." Thus it. seems that Dipanegara was in a position of considerable influence in the years 1810 to 1812, and he was therefore able to ensure the succession

of his father and the appointment of the patih who.was to

become his inveterate enemy in the 1820's,

Sultan Radja died in November 1814 and he was succeeded by Dipanegara's younger brother Djarot, who ‘acceded to the throne on 16 November 1814 with the title Hamengku Buwana IV. Djarot was only ten years of age when he became king,» and his mother took him under her wing. He acquired a taste ‘for the pleasures of the flesh, and he | lived an extravagant and wasteful Life. He became cruel, and when he went riding in his carriage soldiers in the accompanying retinue were of ten knocked from their horses and run down." Djarot died in 1822, possibly as a result of the strenuous and debilitating life he had led. There were unconfirmed suspiéions that he had been poisoned, and some European writers suspected that Dipanegara had poisoned him.. However Tjakranegara states that the food that Djarpt was eating when he died was provided by Pangéran Mangkubumi, the uncle of Djarot. There is little reason to suspect Dipanegara's complicity in the death of his brother,

Djarot was succeeded by his son Menol who was only two years old when he succeeded to the throne on 19 December 1822 with the title Hamengku Buwana V. European sources have claimed that Dipanegara had expected to succeed his brother because the Crown Prince was so young. It is said that Dipanegara had the written agreement of his father that he should succeed his brother, Tjakranegara on the

contrary states that Dipanegara willingly assented to the succession of his nephew:

Déné ta atmadjaningwang

tetep madeg narapati.' Though the succession of Menol may not have aroused the anger of Dipanegara, as some have suggested, dther factors were already in evidence which were to trigger off a new rebellion like those of Raden Rangga or Pangéran Mangkubumi. which had shattered the peace of Mataram in the past. The

events which led to war in 1825 are taken up in Chapter V.

CHAPTER IIT SIGNS AND PORTENTS: THEIR ROLE IN THE BABAD

One problem for historians of Java working from Javanese sources is the manifestly unhistorical nature of mythological and traditional elements that are a natural part of Javanese historical writing. The tendency has been to reject, rather than to understand, However in understanding these elements..and the rationale of their inclusion in historical works, one can gain an important ‘insight into the Javanese view of events. Indicative of this problem is the importance of the presumably mythical search for signs which Dipanegara is supposed by Tjakranegara to have instituted. This episode, which covers over two cantos of the babad, could be dismissed as nonsense, but an understanding of the meaning of the various signs supposedly revealed to Dipanegara gives us a valuable insight into the author's own attitudes towards the prince,and, incidentally, an insight into Javanese historiography generally.

In writing his history of the Java War, Tjakranegara placed some emphasis on the inevitability of the war and of Dipanegara*s failure to defeat the Dutch. His reasons for holding this view are largely personal, His means of conveying it derive from traditional Javanese beliefs, In the early cantos, Tjakranegara' s theme is expressed in. general traditional symbols. In Cantos VI to VIII, the

theme is substantially developed in the story of the search

 AW

for signs and portents, that was supposedly carried out by the servants of Dipanegara.

Tjakranegara inherited the Javanese world view which held that king, country and heaven were sympathetically attuned to each other, and that when the cosmic order approached its periodic destruction, decay spread in the world, and kings were totally evil and rapacious.

According to this view, the messiahs, and the kings of the Golden Age,. were unassailable and their kingdoms were strong and illustrious. Tradition described such kingdoms in the

following terms:

gedé oboré ~ great is its torch padang djagadé - radiant is its realm duwur kukusé - high rising its smoke adoh kunt jarané - far-reaching its fame.

The evil king, on the contrary, was cruel, profligate and always drunk. He neglected administration, and the people fled from his kingdom. Moreover, the country was continually devastated by earthquakes, storms, floods and showers of ashes. There were eclipses of the sun and moon and other omens. These portents and the uncontrolled behaviour of the king were considered by Javanese tradition

to signal the impending downfall and destruction of a kingdom.

1 . : . tae See section on the Javanese Messianic tradition.

S. Moertono, op.cit., p.61. 15

The post-Gianti period in Javanese history” seems to have been regarded as such a ‘bad! era, and Javarese came to hope for a period of destruction which would sweep. away the problems that had accrued.” When the Java War came in 1825, many must have welcomed it as a 'cleansing' war, which promised to rejuvenate society under the leadership of its messiah. Tjakranegara also saw the period before the Java War as essentially 'bad', and he uses traditional motifs to communicate the view that the kingdom of Mataram was doomed to destruction.

In Canto I he speaks of the coming of God's judgement in the form of a devastating storm. Such storms were considered portents of bad times and it seemed to be no coincidence that, as a result, Sultan Sepuh was exiled from his kingdom. The reign of Djarot, Dipanegara's brother, was for Tjakranegara even more ominous and his account of the reign is strongly influenced by the traditional motifs of the 'bad' king. Djarot was still guite young when he came to the throne in 1814. With the connivance of his mother he came to lead a most profligate life, consorting with the most beautiful girls in the kingdom. - He was surrounded by the most expensive luxuries and he amused

himself with fine clothes, perfumes, aromatic oils, the

best. food and wine, gamelan orchestras and dancing girls. In particular he was cruel. For example, he liked to go riding in his carriage with an escort of 200 mounted soldiers; 100 would precede the carriage and the remainder followed behind. The king liked speed and the

carriage often travelled at higher speeds than the mounted escort in front. Consequently soldiers were overtaken, knocked from their horses and killed by the wheels of the carriage. Moreover Djarot was overbearing in the exercise of power, ordering the pulling down of houses and the destruction of gardens in order to straighten a road.

These attributes of Djarot are those of the evil king who presages the end of the kingdom. Tjakranegara relates how Dipanegara, aware of the behaviour of his brother, and the dangerous consequences, tried to advise him to act ina | manner appropriate to kings. He couched his advice in the | form of two stories from the Fatah-ul-Muluk (Victory of Kings). The first concerned a king who had forgotten | religion and now only sought his own pleasures. He dressed | well, had many palace girls, and he drank and ate much. He | went walking one day in the city and he saw a beautiful

horse, He mounted it immediately. The horse reared up violently, throwing him to the ground. The king's head was split open on a rock. The second story concerned a king of Syria who was equally bad. As a result his kingdom and

palace were destroyed in a mighty storm which shook the earth.

lee Canto IL for the life of Djarot. *See Canto II, verses 41-55.

In the narration of these two stories Tjakranegara emphasises the implication that Djarot's reign was God's firm sign that Mataram was soon to be destroyed. Dipanegara himself is made to predict the early demise of his brother in view of his many evil deeds:

Gedé temen dosané ariningwang temahan midjil waspane duh-aduh jaji prabu kaja-kaja wus mertandani

tan awet madeg nata

amengku Mentarum.!

In Cantos VI, VII and VIII, Tjakranegara using more explicit traditional signs, reiterates that Mataram was soon to be devastated by a great war, and he also clarified Dipanegara's part in this war. In this episode Dipanegara is said to have despatched his servants in search of | traditional signs which could indicate how he might fare in the event of the war that seemed inevitable, Tjakranegara explains at some length how the prince's servants set out on two pilgrimages to holy places and the grave of his ancestor Sultan Agung. Here they sought the traditional tokens of kingship, or awaited signs from God or the

ancestors regarding the question which was uppermost in the

1 Canto II, verse 44 beg,

How great are the sins of my younger brother. „He began to crys

"O my younger brother the king

it is as jf it is a sign

that you will not ne king for Long

ruling in Mataram",

prince's mind: whether he could expect to be Messiah-king in the near future as a result of a ‘cleansing! war. Tjakranegara, in stressing Dipanegara's supposed dependence on traditional signs, had a particular end in view. The signs he claims were revealed to Dipanegara are all inauspicious. He thereby demonstrates that the defeat

of Dipanegara was presaged before the war broke out. There

‚is however a less obvious reason for Tjakranegara making

Dipanegara the recipient of inauspicious signs concerning the war. Dipanegara was undoubtedly for Tjakranegara a highly sacred person, most worthy of reverence and yet he fought against him on the side of the Dutch. Writing his babad after the war Tjakranegara must have felt obliged, for reasons of self-justification, to make it seem to have been inevitable before the war that Dipanegara's cause was doomed. To this end he included in his babad a large section enumerating the inauspicious signs which forewarned that Dipanegara must fail in the impending war with the Dutch. Tjakranegara in this way showed that he fought with the Dutch because Dipanegara foolishly flew in the face of hostile fate. This ploy of Tjakranegara explaining Dipanegara's failure in traditional terms.must have put his mind at ease and at the same time enabled him to write a history laudatory of the prince, though he at all times reserved this ultimate sanction against the prince of the futility of his cause.

. Dipanegara in his autobiography would seem to put a

point of view contradicting the views of Tjakranegara. 

 

4g

Dipanegara himself claims to have seen and sought traditional signs of kingship but he also asserts that all such signs were auspicious. This basic difference of opinion derives from the completely different interests of the two authors. In contrast to Tjakranegara, Dipanegara in his autobiography could not admit to having been wrong or misguided and he therefore maintained the assertion that he was destined to be king and Messiah.

Tjakranegara in Canto VI begins to narrate the story of Dipanegara's searching for signs. It is stated that Dipanegara had already become aware of the plotting of the minister Danuredja with the Queen Mother, who were attempting to force the Dutch to take some action against the prince by either imprisoning or banishing him. Danuredja in fact began to circulate rumours that Dipanegara had already begun to mobilize at his estate at Silarong. It is at this point that Dipanegara for the first time considered the real possibility of rebellion. He was however troubled by doubts. Would he be successful? Would he be king?

Were God and the ancestors in accord with his ambitions? To allay these doubts, he sent his servants on two pilgrimages in search of signs to answer these questions,

Dipanegara first sent his closest advisor

Djajamustapa on a lone journey to Imagiri, the burial place 

50

of Sultan Agung. It is interesting that Tjakranegara should claim that Dipanegara sought in this way to divine the will of his most august ancestor. Dipanegara was in fact a descendant of Sultan Agung through the line of Amengkubuwana I; founder of Jogjakarta. Before he attempted to seize the throne he had first to see if this in fact was agreed to by Sultan Agung who was regarded as having hegemony over the welfare and future of his clan.”

Tjakranegara relates how, on the orders of his master, Djajamustapa travelled alone to Imagiri and spent the night there praying at the foot-end of the grave. Here Djajamustapa prayed that a sign be shown him:

'Adedonga Djajamustapa sedalu

duta muga-muga

1

Tjakranegara records that Dipanegara visited Imagiri himself (Canto IV, verse 39 g) and that he also often visited the Southern Ocean district just as Sénapati did. See further Canto III, verses 1-3; and Canto IV, verses. 39-40. These visits were part of Dipanegara's religious pilgrimages, but he cannot have been unaware of the connection of Imagiri amd the Southern Ocean with the fortunes of the Mataram dynasty. For Sénapati and Njai Rara Kidul see Babad Tanah Djawi (Javanese version), pp.80-1;and Soemarsaid Moertono, 'State and Statecraft in old Java’, Cornell Monograph Series, 1968, Pe 61.

Such seeking of signs from ancestors is not uncommon in ' Java. Many intending rebels have sought advice in graveyards. Even.today in Java exam, time signals “pilgrimages to grave sites where students beseech their ancestors to bestow on them blessings to help them to pass.

The following morning he and the custodian of the grave, Ki

~Balad, re-entered the burial place, and having swept and

tidied the area, they sat down to pray. It was then that Djajamustapa noticed a red spot like blood on the curtain

covering the grave: Abang bunder sapiring wetaranipun pernahé kang erah tengah beneré langséné makamipun Sultan Agung Mentaram.

This was in fact the sign he had been sent to find. He went outside to ask Ki Balad if the red spot had been there long and what was in fact the meaning of this apparition,

Ki Balad explained that God in this sign had decreed that warfare would descend on Java and that much blood would be

spilt. For good or bad, this was the will of God and no one

could avoid it:

1 Canto VI, verse 31. Djajamustapa prayed the whole night “O may (my master's) envoy be given a sign if he be given a message." 2 Canto VI; verse. 35. The spot was) red, and round, the size of a plate | (Ee mas) like blood, it was) in the very centre of the curtain which shrouded the grave of Sultan Agung of Mataram, 

52

katah erah kang badé tumibeng lemah.

Genah rusak wus pinesti tekdiripun

tan kénging tinambak

lamun wus prapta tekdirt.! So declared God and the ancestors. As Dipanegara had feared, there was to be a great and destructive war, but it had not been revealed if Dipanegara was to prosper by it. All he knew was that it was decreed by God that there was to be a war and it was his fate to be involved in it.

Djajamustapa returned home immediately and informed his master of the sign revealed to him. Dipanegara realised the full import of the sign and also its ambiguity. He had next to discover how he should fare in this impending war. Dipanegara, in Tjakranegara's eyes, had obviously begun to have designs on the kingship of Jogjakarta. He now wished to know whether he would be king. As before, Dipanegara is made to seek the answer to his guestionings by traditional means. He sent Djajamustapa on a second, more extensive mission. Djajamustapa's initial task was to journey to the town of 1 . Canto VI, verses 38 b-39 c.

Tjilatjap on the south coast of Central Java, there to seek the Djajakusuma flower which was reputed to grow on Nusakambangan, an island off the coast.

The name 'Djajakusuma' or 'Widjajakusuma' means 'flower of victory!, and its possession is a portent of victory or success. According to tradition, the Djajakusuma flower had to be sought in Nusakambangan by claimants to the throne, but if the flower could not be found it was clear that the pretender's claims were not legitimate and his cause must fail." The Babad Tanah Djawi records how Mangkurat Il, king of Mataram, succeeded in finding a Djajakusuma flower, Mangkurat II, also known as Pang€ran Adipati Anom (his official title as crown-prince), was the son of Mangkurat I; who left the kraton of Mataram in the year 1600 A.J. when the Madurese prince Trunadjaja invaded Java.” Mangkurat I died at Tegalwangi soon after his flight and Pangeran Adipati Anom succeeded to the throne of Mangkurat IL, The Dutch decided to support his claims against those of Trunadjaja who was soon driven from the rebel capital of Kediri. Mangkurat II was then crowned at Kartasura... Nevertheless, he would seem to have been unsure of his position for the Babad Tanah Djawi records that he sent his servant Pranataka to search for the Widjajakusuma flower which would

legitimize his position:

 

1

T. Roorda, ‘Verhaal van de Oorsprong en het Begin van de opstand van Dipanegara'. BKI (1860), p.171.

2

The significance of his attack in 1600 A.J. has been discussed above (Chapter II). 

54

Pranataka, you are to go to Donan or to the island Kambang. Seek the Widjajakusuma flower. Be sure to find it. Do not come back if you have not found it.1

Pranataka went to Nusakambangan and meditated for seven days and seven nights in the 'Mesdjid Watu! (Stone Mosque), the very place that Dipanegara's servants were to visit. Here he found a pair of Djajakusuma flowers and having picked them returned to his master.” Mangkurat II was very pleased with this, for it had proved his kingship to be legitimate:

The king was very happy, for he realized that his kingship would be prosperous.

Mangkurat II did in fact have a prosperous reign from 1677-1703 A.D. Moreover he was to kill the rebel Trunadjaja with his own hands soon after obtaining the Djajakusuma, and in this way was seen to remove the only threat to his

position.

WL. Olthof, Babad Tanah Djawi (Jav. version), p.176.

2 ipanegara's servants visited the Stone Mosgue, after they had failed to go to Nusakambangan where the Dja jakusuma flower grew. In view of the fact that the Babad Tanah Djawi clearly states that the flower could be found at the Stone Mosgue, it would seem that Tjakranegara was confused both about the tradition itself and the geography of the Tjilatjap-Nusakambangan region. For example he seems to call Nusakambangan by three different names: pulo Madjeti, Nini or Nini-Nini, and Brambang. Moreover from what he says in Canto VI one would assume that the Mesdjid Séla was not on Nusakambangan nor near it, principally because it cost much more to be ferried to Nusakambangan than to Mesdjid Séla. Yet the Babad Tanah Djawi story of Mangkurat II would seem to suggest that the Stone Mosque was in fact on Nusakambangan. The solution may be to accept that Tjakranegara was confused about the geography of the region and one should therefore ignore the difficulties outlined above. Tjakranegara's basic contention was that Dipanegara sought the Widjajakusuma in the area where it traditionally grew and failed to find it.

Possession of the Djajakusuma flower was therefore important for any person wishing to embark on a prosperous and successful kingship, but it also seems to have had general application. For example in the wayang lakon Wisnu Krama," Wisnu has to obtain a Djajakusuma flower before he can marry D€wi Pratiwi. Only he who finds this flower can have her hand. Wisnu obtains the flower on Mt Argadjati, but only after he has married the daughter of the seer who lives on the mountain. Another contender for Déwi Pratiwi's hand also obtains a Djajakusuma flower, but in his case it is to be found on the neck of a blue-coloured buffalo.

Dipanegara's own search for the Djajakusuma flower is therefore part of a very old Javanese tradition. To find this flower was to achieve success, just as Mangkurat IL achieved success. Not to find it was to realize that one's cause was doomed to failure.

Dipanegara gave further orders that if Djajamustapa could not obtain a Djajakusuma flower, he was to make a long pilgrimage to many places in Central Java to discover what in fact his fate would be. Djajamustapa was to visit Pasir, Gumelem, Mt Segara Windu, Tjahjana, Pekiringan, Lawet and other holy places. In all of these places Djajamustapa was to meditate and pray, beseeching God to reveal

Dipanegara's role in the coming war. A number of persons

The difficulty caused by both contenders finding the flower is solved in battle. Wisnu wins. 

56

were assigned to accompany Djajamustapa including Djanodin, his son Abukasan and a holy man from the village of Gujangan, Kjai Mopid.

When eventually sent on their way by Dipanegara, the party travelled almost due west from the city of Jogjakarta, crossing wild and heavily forested country, until they came to the Seraju River. They crossed the river in a ferry, but they were most terrified to see a very large crocodile in the river:

Agengipun kang baja kelangkung-langkung

gigiré seklasa

sami trataban atiné

aningali dumateng baja kang ngambang. They reached the other side of the river safely and they quickly disembarked, obviously a little concerned at the sighting of this crocodile.

Was this a sign? The Babad Tanah Djawi records that Djaka Tingkir did battle with a crocodile army and, having defeated them, he forced them to send one crocodile a year as tribute. This episode has been interpreted as metaphorically describing a battle between Djaka Tingkir

and the city of Surabaja, whose name ending in ‘baja! is

1 Canto VI, verse 57 i-iv. The crocodile was very large its back was as big as a mat and they were scared in their hearts seeing the floating crocodile.

 

 

57

reminiscent of the Javanese word for crocodile baja! The sighting of a crocodile on the Seraju River in South Central Java could hardly have a connection with Surabaja in East Java. It may well be that Tjakranegara may have introduced this encounter with the crocodile merely to add local colour or perhaps comic relief.

Having alighted from the boat on the other side of the river, the group continued their journey and soon came to the coastline which faces the island of Nusakambangan, some ten to fifteen miles from the mouth of the Seraju River. They followed the coastline, making for Tjilatjap.

Suddenly they saw seven deer from the island coming down to the shore” and gambolling on the waves. When spotted by the pilgrims, the deer fled into the forest. This chance meeting with the seven deer is less easy to dismiss as insignificant than their earlier encounter with the crocodile. One is compelled to ask why were seven

sighted and why were they deer? Did Tjakranegara intend that this be interpreted as a sign? The number seven has been accorded a great deal of significance and magical power by many cultures, being considered lucky and fortuitous. Deer also have been regarded as regal symbols, while the Buddha has been symbolized as a deer because his

Lis interpretation was pointed out by Professor Berg in seminars given at the A.N.U. in 1969.

As one approaches Tjilajap the coast and the shoreline of Nusakambangan converge until there remains only a narrow channel between them. The author presumably meant that when the shoreline of the island came into view they happened to see these seven deer. 

 

58

first sermon after attaining enlightenment was pre ached in the Deer Park at Benares. Thus the sighting of seven deer by the pilgrims may have been a fortuitous sign forecasting kingship for Dipanegara, but this interpretation is by no means sure and is unsupported by similar incidents in other Javanese historical works.

Late on the same day that they had sighted the seven deer, they arrived in Tjilatjap, which in those days was only a small village with few inhabitants: 'Désa suwung wung aparek wana agung! Here they stayed the night in the home of the village head Kjai Resajuda and inquired of him the cost of travelling by boat first to the Mesdjid Séla (Stone Mosque)? and then to the island of Nusakambangan where they ihtended to seek the Widjajakusuma flower.

Kjai Resajuda, to their chagrin, explained that the cost of travelling by boat to pulo Madjeti (Nusakambangan) was indeed expensive, costing 100 ringgits: lp jilatjap under the Dutch developed into an important port and the most important centre on Java's South Coast. It is interesting to note that while Tjilatjap,as early as 1905 had

approximately 16,000 inhabitants, in the middle of the

nineteenth century it was only a small hamlet.

2 'The village was inhabitated by few people, it was like a

great forest.' Canto VI, verse 63 i.

Írnis is referred to as Nini-nini island “and, as pointed out in an earlier note, the author seems to use a number of names for Nusakambangan including Nini-nini, though in fact two separate localities or islands are intended, i.e. Nusakambangan itself and a smaller island or possibly a rocky outcrop which is the 'Stone Mosque! they eventually visit instead of Nusakambangan.

1

Nusakambangan is referred to as Madjeti island. 

 

59

Jen sampé jan arsa

pulo Madjeti pernahé

pan akatah puniku weragadira

satus ringgit mangké kula terken bagus

alampah baita

pulo Madjeti marginé

nenggih ladjeng dateng pulo Nini pisan. Djajamustapa did not have 100 ringgits to pay for the boat and as a result Dipanegara failed to obtain the Djajakusuma flower, the symbol of a legitimate claimant to the throne. There was no way for Djajamustapa to reach the island where this flower grew and thus Dipanegara's future as king was placed in extreme jeopardy.

Having failed to find the Djajakusuma flower, they sought to carry out Dipanegara's supplementary orders. They asked the cost of a journey by boat to the Mesdjid Séla and Resajuda informed them that this would cost only two rials. This they could afford, and so they departed for the Mesdjid séla. They spent several days at this lonely holy place. First they cleared the interior of sand and grass and lit a fire. Each night they prayed and meditated in the cave and

during the day they went out into the open. In their

1 Canto VI, verse 66 b-7 d. If you want to go to pulo Madjeti (Nusakambangan) it will be very expensive for one hundred ringgits I will take you there by boat to the island of Madjeti and then even to the island of Nini.

prayers they asked that Mataram (Jogjakarta) prosper and that their master also be looked upon with favour:

Aneneda mring Allah kang Mahasutji ardjané Mentaram sampun kawis-kawis . ’ 1 djeng pangeran selameta.

While ki Djanodin was asleep one night in the Stone Mosque, there came the sign that they all awaited. Dipanegara appeared to ki Djanodin in a dream, riding on the cow Gumarang. This beast was as big as a hill, but its feet were caught in the roots of a Balaran vine.” The cow however hroke loose and quickly ran off carrying the prince with it.

Ki Djanodin awoke from his sleep and thought over the meaning of this sign. lt was in fact a most ominous sign, intimating that Dipanegara was to be the cause of misery and destruction in Java, The cow Gumarang is a wajang figure connected with the rice myths of Déwi Sri and Prince Sedana. There are many variations of the Déwi Sri-Prince Sedana stories, but W.H. Rassers in his article, 'On the Meaning of Javanese Drama! „> gives a precis of one story which is

helpful for an understanding of Djanodin's dream:

tcanto VII, verse 9 i-iv. They prayed to God the All Pure they prayed for the prosperity of Mataram it was hoped that the prince may prosper.

“Canto VII, verse ll i-iv.

A

This story is summarised here in the author's own words. 

“61

Batara Guru in order to obtain the favours of the lovely Ken Tisnawati has been forced to fulfil three of her wishes. She desires a garment that will not wear out; food which, once eaten, satisfies for the rest of one's life, and the gamelan ketopjak. Batara Guru calls on the demon Kala and his son Kala Gumarang to fulfil these demands. (It is interesting to note that the two demons are supposed to live on the island of Nusakambangan, while ki Djanodin dreams of the cow Gumarang in

„the Mesdjid Séla, presumably not far off from Nusakambangan).

The demon Kala Gumarang becomes arrogant as a result, and angers the gods who wish that he turn into an animal. He later meets Déwi Sri and begins to chase her. He meets Wisnu, the husband of Dewi Sri, and demands that he hand over his wife. Both Dewi Sri and Wisnu run off, chased by Kala Gumarang. Wisnu, three days: later during the chase, confronts Kala Gumarang in a wood and fires arrows at him. At this Kala Gumarang becomes a pig.

In the meantime Ken Tisnawati has died and her body, returned to earth, has brought forth various agricultural products, including rice. In his animal form Kala Gumarang still pursues Dewi Sri and coming across the new rice-fields tramples them. . To protect the rice Wisnu shoots at the pig and kills him, but from his blood proceed all kinds of insects and diseases which destroy the rice crop.

The soul of Kala Gumarang passes into the bodies of the ascetic Pufut Djantaka's childrén, all of whom have the form of animals,including a wild bull and a buffató,These animals also destroy the rice crop.Therefore the king of the country sends out his servants to kill the animals and are“largely, successful,but theswildibull and buffalo remain free, These too however are defeated and they are tethered by their conquerors to a large tree.

The two beasts thus subdued could well have been known as lembu Gumarang (the buffalo Gumarang) or the sapi Gumarang (cow Gumarang), because they had their origins in the soul of the demon Kala Gumarang, If this is so, the sapi Gumarang of the babad can be seen as

identical with the beasts which sprang from the soul of the 

 

62

demon killed by Wisnu. In this context it is important to note that the sapi Gumarang of the babad was tied down with the vine of a balaran tree. In the same way, the bull and buffalo of the rice myth were tethered by their conquerors. This striking similarity of detail strongly suggests that the cow Gumarang ridden by Dipanegara and the rampaging beasts of the rice myth are identical.

What therefore is the significance of Ki Djanodin's dream? It is suggested that the beast's breaking loose and escaping with Dipanegara on its back is most probably a prophecy that Dipanegara, in releasing the beast, would be a destructive force in Java, just as Kala Gumarang and sapi Gumarang were destructive of the rice crop as they chased after Déwi Sri. “This interpretation accords with the other ominous signs that were to be revealed as the servants of Dipanegara continued their journey.

Having received this sign at the Mesdjid Séla, the next day they all returned to the mainland and journeyed northwards to Pasir. Thereafter they visited all the holy places their master had ordered them to visit, all the time praying for the prosperity of Mataram:

Kang tineda ardjané nagri Mentawis

hajwa kongsi rusak. Their prayers may well have been more earnest now in view of the ominous pattern that had already begun to emerge. 1

Canto VII, verse 20 a-bs ‘They prayed for the prosperity of Mataram; and that it should not be destroyed.! 

 

 

63

They spent one night on a mountain called Segara Windu and here a great and terrifying storm descended on them. All during the night, wind, rain, cold and the mountain spirits assailed them.” Was this also a sign of impending doom? |

At Pekiringan the pilgrims spent the night at the burial place of the wali Prakosa:

Kawarnaa semana lampahé prapti

nenepi kuburan

sawengi makamé wali

kang arannja wali Prakosa.? Here tHey meditated and made penance during the night and again a sign was revealed to them. The wind tore down the curtain surrounding the grave and bore it away.

At Tjahjana they also spent one night in meditation at a graveside and again the curtain surrounding the burial place had disappeared by morning. These signs all troubled

Ki Mopid and Djajamustapa:

1 Canto VII, verses 21-4. 2 The walis are reputed to be the Muslim teachers who first spread Islam in Java. Their burial places are important pilgrimage spots and Javanese believe that by sleeping at such burial places, one can obtain great favours from the wali buried there. It is only natural that Dipanegara's envoys should stop there. 3 Canto VII, verse 26 i-iv. Lt is described how they arrived and did penance at the grave one night (they spent) at the burial place of the wali called wali Prakosa, 

64

Duk semana Djajamustapa lan Mopid langkung susahira sesmita datan ngénaki

deladjat negri Mentaram,

Kaja-kaja negara Mentaram iki

harep karusakan

djalarané apa béndjing

rusaké nagri Mentaram. All the signs pointed to the imminent destruction of Mataram (Jogja). The following day they climbed Mt Lawet and spent the day there praying. They were soon to be rewarded with yet another sign. The curtain surrounding the burial place on this mountain also disappeared as before, but here a ravine opened up and part of the mountain collapsed into the ravine. Thus the sign from the wali buried there agreed with the spectacular sign sent by God and revealed by the destruction of the mountain,Mataram was to be destroyed. Ki Mopid and Djajamustapa in discussing the significance of all these signs were most disturbed by their ominous portents but nevertheless recognized that if this was the will of God

then no human could avert it. They exclaimed ‘Wit ora,

 

1 Canto VII, verses 29-30, At that time Djajamustapa and ki Mopid were very disturbed there was an omen which was bad as far as the power of Mataram was concerned.

It seems as if Mataram

will be destroyed

what should be the reason

that Mataram will be destroyed. 

65

maring ora",! meaning we humans originate from nothing through the goodness of God, and we cannot avert the will of God that we should go to dust, It is the plaintive cry of those who are helpless to avoid the future fraught with destruction.

The pilgrims, having visited the two mountains Merapi and Merbabu, made their way home to Tegalredja. Drawing near to Tegalredja one evening, they were compelled to spend the night in the mosgue at Kuwaron rather than travel at night. Here ki Mopid received another sign in a dream. The ancient seer ki Gedé ing Séla (Ki Ageng Séla) appeared to him in a dream and gave him a warning which was to be transmitted to his master:

"Dipanegara bésuk

meksa arep amurwèng urip

ngrata agama sarak

djinurung Al-Sabur

sinung rahmat ingkang Mul ja

nanging ana béka rentjanané béndjing

sisip sembir wruh bakal

jén sumimpang ing patang prakawis hudjubrija tekabur sumengah

pesti lulusé karepé

jèn adoh saking iku

lamun nradjang patang prakawis

1 Canto VIII, verse 2 j. 

 

66

rahmat hidajat benggang

wangsul wahjunipun. + In this prophecy Ki Gedé ing Séla first stated that it was God's will that Dipanegara should be king and that as king he would spread the Islamic religion and its law in Java. Nevertheless God's blessings on Dipanegara would be withdrawn if at any time in the future Dipanegara should give way to conceit, vanity and recklessness,

In some ways this particular sign seems to contradict the basic theme of all the previous signs which overwhelmingly had declared that Dipanegara was not to be king, because he had failed to find the Djajakusuma flower and secondly that Dipanegara was to instigate a great war which would devastate the whole of Java. Now Ki Gedé ing Séla would: seem to be saying that all was not lost for Dipanegara if he retained the humility he had already been noted for.

Yet this also is an ominous sign for Dipanegara, It is in fact Tjakranegara's method of disposing of Dipanegara's claims to the Jogja throne and also of explaining the prince's failure in the war. Tjakranegara later shows that 1 .

Canto VIII, verses 10 iv.-11 viii. 'Dipanegara in the future will have decision over life (and death): he will spread (the Islamic) religion and ' the Sjariah law: he will be assisted by God, and he will be given the blessings of the Blessed One; But there will be a difficulty later on; I see a risk in the future; | “If he avoids these FOUR things: recklessness, pride and conceit (only three are guoted) He will succeed in his efforts. | If he strays from this path, if he falls prey to these

four things, the Blessings and the Guidance of God will disappear, nay the Light of God will disappear,

 

 

67

in proclaiming himself Sultan at Silarong at the insistence of Kjai Madja, Dipanegara neglected the advice of Ki Ageng Séla, succumbing as he did to the vain attraction of the title of Sultan. God's blessings were accordingly withdrawn from Dipanegara and thus his cause was doomed. The reader

is left to assume that Tjakranegara was well.aware of this and thus thought it wise to fight with the Dutch.

The morning after Ki Mopid's dream, the group set out and arrived at Tegalredja at noon. They immediately reported to Dipanegara that all his orders had been duly carried out. They conveyed the various signs that they had seen and explained their significance. They also had to report that they had been unable to obtain the Djajakusuma flower. Dipanegara quietly accepted the signs and their ominous portents, affirming that if he was to be the cause of destruction in the kingdom, then this was God's will and no man could avert it:

'Lamun kaja mengkonoa

pralambang kang dawuh

ija negara lientaram

hura-huru djalaran saking ing mami

2 terus karsaning Allah.

Canto VIII, verse 15 vi-ix,

“It that is the case with the predictions which have come (i. e. they have all been bad), that is to say that the state of Mataram will fall into confusion and disarray because of me, then that is the will of God.

The message of Ki Gedé ing Séla was repeated to Dipanegara by a mysterious voice as he sat meditating on the signs that had been revealed to his servants. This reinforced in Dipanegara's mind the warning that his kingship would not succeed if he gave way to conceit and vanity.

In this way Tjakranegara concludes his lengthy account of the signs revealed to Dipanegara before the outbreak of war. The whole episode is undoubtedly a fiction created by the author for his own ends, for the events recorded by him are not to be found anywhere else, in particular in the autobiography of Dipanegara. Whether fiction or not, this episode plays a most important part in Tjakranegara's babad. It is a resort to traditional magical means to explain post-eventum, Dipanegara's failure in the Java War, by showing that before the war had even begun his failure and the war itself had been predestined by God. It is also a means for Tjakranegara explaining his participation in the war on the side of the Dutch even though he obviously respected Dipanegara very much indeed, as one can gauge from the rest of his babad. In this respect it is important to note Tjakranegara's anti-Dipanegara stand in his narration of the journeying after signs. It has been generally assumed that he was wholly partial to Dipanegara, however it is clear that for largely personal motives he was prepared to question Dipanegara's actions by traditional means.

Dipanegara in his autobiography also relates how he received various signs from God. He does not claim to have

sent his servants in search of signs. .He claims to have 

received himself all the signs revealed to him. More significantly, these signs generally do not accord with those enumerated by Tjakranegara and they are nearly all propitious. For Dipanegara, the heavens foretold his kingship. When he was still a baby his great-grandfather took him in his arms and stated that this child would one day be a king, and greater than he. |

However a warning in some ways similar to that allegedly delivered by Ki Gedé ing Séla in the Tjakranegara account,. is also to be found in the autobiography. From Sunan Kali appearing before him one night as he fasted in a cave, Dipanegara claims to have received this prophecy:

heh Ngabdurahim siréku

wus pinasti hjang Suksma

lamun sira iku béndjang.

“dadi ratu ngérang-érang nuli musna.

This enigmatic warning in Dipanegara's autobiography would seem to have some connection with the pattern of signs elaborated in Tjakranegara's babad. But it would seem to be

the only point of similarity.

tp angéran Dipanegara, 'Babad Dipanegara pijambak' (ed. Rusche), 2 vols., Surakarta, 1908-9. Vol. 1, p.2.

heh Ngabdurahim

it has been determined by Goa

‘that if in thé future

as king you are humiliated, then

you will perish. | Sunan Kali(-djaga) is a famous legendary saint, popularly linked with the introduction of Islam to Java. During his pilgrimages and fasts, Dipanegara took an Arabic name, either

Ngabdurahim: or, later on, Ngabdulkamid. P.J. Louw, op,.cit, vol.l, p.92, has quite a different translation for „what must ‘be the same passage. There Louw has read 'ratu ngérang-érang!

as tratu_hiring', The difference may result from different MSS. having been used. 

70

Dipanegara also relates that he went to Imagiri, the burial place of Sultan Agung and the Mataram dynasty, and here he meditated at the junction of the Opak and Oja rivers. Here the guardian of the Mataram dynasty the queen of the Southern Ocean, Njai Rara Kidul, visited Dipanegara and offered him assistance for the fulfilment of his ambitions, just as she had offered to help Sénapati, the founder of Mataram. Sénapati, like Dipanegara, had journeyed to the shores of the Southern Ocean and he began to pray at the mouth of the Opak river, but the power of his prayers upset the balance of nature and the sea was greatly disturbed. Therefore Njai Rara Kidul, protectress of the ocean, granted all his wishes, prophesying greatness for him and his descendants; ‘You and your descendants shall surely all be kings and rule over Java and you shall have no eguals.'! |

Dipanegara most certainly thought of himself as a descendant of the Mataram dynasty and as one who had a right to share in the fame and fortune of that line. For this reason he records that he too encountered Njai Rara Kidul:

Djeng Ratu Kidul wus prapta neng arsa Sdh Ngabdurahim mapan padang djroning guwa ing djeng Ratu wus udani lamun Seh Ngabdurahim

lagi suwung tjipatanipun

datan kénging ginoda

 

1 TT. W.L, Olthof, “Babad Tanah Djawi', p.78.

 

71

dadya umatur ubanggi

lamun b€ndjang tekeng masa badé prapta."

Like several kings of Mataram before him,” Dipanegara also received the royal lustre which is the symbol of all legitimate kings. One day he was sitting meditating when from the heavens came a bolt of lightning, which then stuck in a rock, This was the arrow called Sarutama, or excellent arrow, and Dipanegara had it fashioned into a kris? In this way Dipanegara clainied for himself the receipt of the royal lustre. Every legitimate king should possess it in some form or other, and it is only to he expected that Dipanegara should make such a claim.

The autobiography also records that during one of his pilgrimages Dipanegara was acclaimed by the Ratu Adil, the traditional Javanese Messiah. Dipanegara was later to take on himself the title Erut jakra which belongs to the Messiah, but at this stage he was supposed to have merely accapted

the armies of the Messiah:

 

L Rusche, op.cit., vol.l, pe. Ratu Kidul came . before Seh Ngabdurahim (Dipanegara) it was bright in the cave the Queen knew that Sèh Ngabdurahim was deeply involved in his thoughts and he could not be disturbed then she said , that when the time came, she would come. 5 | In particular Pangéran Puger (later Pakubuwana I) who received the royal lustre in the form of a tip of light on _ the penis of his dead predecessor, Amangkurat I. See Babad Tanah Djawi (Jav. version), p.260 and S. Moertono, 'State and Statecraft in Old Java', 1968, pp.56-9. 

72

He spoke: "Hear me, Ngabdulkamid! JI have

brought you here to tell you that you must

lead my entire army into battle, Conquer

Java with it." Though Tjakranegara makes no mention of the Messiah except in connection with Dipanegara's title when proclaimed Sultan, it is important to note that Dipanegara showed a great deal more interest in it. Finally Dipanegara claims that it was God who proclaimed him Sultan, even before the war had begun. How different an interpretation is this from that put forward by Tjakranegara. The autobiography

states:

The Prince was sitting under a banyan tree, after the midday prayer, about half-—past three, in the garden called Modang when he heard from the distance a clear voice which called out to him: "Listen Ngabdulkamid! God Almighty bestows on you from now on the name of Sultan Ngabdulkamid Erutjakra Sajidin Panatagama Djawa Chalifat Rasulullah."2

The signs purported to be seen by Dipanegara vary quite radically between the babad of Tjakranegara and Dipanegara's autobiography. Their very significance is made to vary. Dipanegara himself claims to have been revealed only fortuitous signs. Tjakranegara on the contrary suggests by means of a number of traditional symbols that the Java War was inevitable and that Dipanegara's defeat in the war had been foretold. This striking difference reflects the different motives and prejudices of the authors and it also demonstrates the need to be aware not only of such prejudices,

but also the traditional and often enigmatic way in which

they can be expressed in Javanese historiography.

CHAPTER IV DIPANEGARA'S SOURCES OF SUPPORT

Tjakranegara states that immediately prior to the outbreak of war, many. people flocked to the support of Dipanegara, from all classes of society, from the villages and from the capital:

Dalu katah djalma prapti

désa mjang pradjat It is important to investigate the sources of this support, and to assess what charisma Dipanegara held for these Javanese from all sections of Jogja society. Two aspects are suggested as a partial answer. - In Part A of this chapter possible reactions to Dipanegara's devotion to Islam, and in Part B the possible impact of Javanese messianic

traditions are examined.

A Dipanegara and Islam

In Tjakranegara's depiction of Dipanegara's life-style, the Islamic religion and its mystical school, Sufism, emerge as the most important single element. This aspect was not often properly appreciated by Dutch scholars, for the Dutch had much to fear from the uniting power of Islam within the archipelago. Thus Dipanegara's devotion to Islam has been dismissed by some European commentators as fanaticism and a 1 Canto IX, 9, e-f.

At night many people came from the villages and the capital. 

74

weakness. Tjakranegara on the contrary provides a sympathetic view of Dipanegara's religiosity and it is for us to explore the „Javanese view of and reactions to this aspect of Dipanegara's character.

Unlike most of the princes and high officials of Jogjakarta, Dipanegara led a very simple life. Having wholeheartedly accepted the Islamic religion, he turned all his energies to the problem of salvation in the hereafter and the absolution of sin. He became obsessed with death and man's helplessness in the face of his sinful nature:

‘Amung kang késti wardaja ing besuk jen ingsun mati adja nganti gendong dosa jen tjilaka djroning pati sapa ingkang nulungi

ana ing neraka bésuk. siksané tumpa-tumpa”

Convinced he was carrying a great burden of sins, Dipanegara set about whittling them away by performing acts of piety and by constant prayer and meditation. He avoided licentiousness, lived an ascetic life, fasted and

made freguent gifts to the poor.

 

For example, see P.H. van der Kemp, 'Dipanegara, een Geschiedkundige Hamlettype', BKI (1896), pp.283-433.

2 Canto III, v5 . 'The only thing I desire in my heart is that if, in the future, I die may I not carry a burden of sins for if I do when I die who can help me? in hell later on the torments will pile up. 

75

The desire for a simple ascetic life was an ideal of the Sufis, the mystics of Islam." They believed that only by eschewing wealth and wordly things could one attain the eternal fruit of Gnosis or knowledge of God. The story of Ibrahim bin Adham, one of the earliest Sufi ascetics, shows how this prince abandoned the world when God warned him of its falseness:

‘My father was of Balkh,! Ibrahim bin Adham ‚is reported to have said, ‘and he was one of the kings of Khorasan. One day I was out riding with my dog, when a hare or a fox started. TI pricked on my horse; then

I heard a.voice behind me saying, 'It was not for this thou wast created: it was not this thou was charged to dot! eecee L stopped and said, 'I have been roused! A warning has come to me from the Lord of the Worlds. Verily, I will not disobey God from this day on.! Then I returned to my people, and abandoned my horse; I came to*one of my father's shepherds, and took his robe and cloak, and put my raiment upon him,

Tjakranegara describes how closely Dipanegara conformed to the Sufi ascetic ideal. When fasting, for example, he ate only once every two months. Moreover he visited his

wives in the harem on Thursdays only, and if one can judge

The Sufis were the mystical school of Islam which developed under the influence of Christian, Indian and Persian mystical beliefs. Their principal goal was personal knowledge of God through meditation and through the heart. See R.A. Nicholson, ‘The Mystics of Islam', and A.J. Arberry, 'Sufism', London, 1963. For Sufism in Java see: A.H. Johns, ‘Sufism

from the complaints of one of his wives, he abstained from sexual-intercourse even then.

For the Sufi mystic, asceticism was no more than a preparatory stage before one could properly turn to mystical and spiritual exercises. Dipanegara also did not restrict himself to outward displays of piety, but also involved himself deeply in prayer, meditation and mystical regimens. Dipanegara was accustomed to meditate in the open, sitting on the Watu Gegilan 2 or in one of the many caves he visited in the region of Jogja. Here he performed the ojrat technique of mysticism:

Pangéran Dipanegara

tan pegat amangun téki

ing guwa Silarong gonnja

winangun den busanani

sri kinarja nenepi

pangéran ngodjrat neng ngriku pangran karem tirakate” This form of meditation involved long periods of silent reflection, the rapid repetition of prayers and exhortations,

77

such as 'Allahu Akbar! (God is Great), and readings from the Kur'anand other works by mystics and Muslim scholars. Tjakranegara emphasises again and again that meditation was a constant joy to the prince.

Dipanegara was very familiar with the Kur'an. It is related how on a visit to the Upas cave, Dipanegara was impressed with the glory of the Creation when he came across a chill, limpid stream in the centre of the cave. He therefore had his servant read the Ya Sin Surah which praises the beauty of the Creation, but which also warns of God's destruction:

Alas for My bondsmen! They laugh to scorn every apostle that comes to them. Do they not see how many generations we hawe destroyed before them? Never shall they

return to them: all shall be brought before Us.

Let the once-dead earth be a sign to them.

We gave it life, and from it produced grain for their sustenance. We planted it with the palm and the vine, and watered it with gushing springs...

We have taught Mohammed no poetry, nor does it become him to be a poet. This is but a warning: an eloquent Kur'an to admonish the living and to pass judgement on the unbelievers, Every night the Kur'an was read by Dipanegara and he would also have it read to him by his servants during the day: Pangéran Dipanegara

lamun dalu matja Kur'an sang pekik

mung tiga djus wangenipun

 

1 Ya Sin Surah. N.J. Dawood (trans.), 'The Koran', Penguin

78

nimbali dasihé énd jang kinumpulan sagungé kang sepuh-sepuh kapan kinen matja Kur'an sami ndarus ganti-ganti. Dipanegara's reading was not restricted to the Kur'an. He was familiar with many Islamic works originating from the Middle East and India. Dipanegara's servants would read

to him from books on law, or from the Anbija, the 'Lives of .

the Prophets'. They would read Sufi works on gnosis

(makripat) and mysticism (tasawup). There were didactic books about the good and bad kings of Arabia and Syria, and Dipanegara drew many lessons from the tales of evil kings in the 'Fatah-ul-Muluk! (Victory of Kings). The traditional works of Javanese literature with their Hindu gods and heroes and non-Islamic philosophy were also studied.

Dipanegara often called upon his servants to read from the

Ardjunawidjaja, Serat Rama, Ardjunawiwaha and the Bomantaka. The reading of these works was a constant task. Each month the books were changed so that the prince did not become

bored.

The lessons were for the benefit of Dipanegara's irreligious and immoral brother Djarot. See Canto III, verses 41-55.

Spor Dipanegara's reading tastes, see Canto IV, verses 32-9. 

79

Dipanegara spent much of his time at Tegalredja, not far from Jogja, and at another of his estates, Sélaradja, to the east of Tegalredja. However he frequently gave up his reading and prayer in the relative comfort of his various residences, and he went out on pilgrimages, dressed in simple clothes, in order to perform more severe acts of penance. Tjakranegara relates how these pilgrimages took him to lonely places such as the South Coast and the Southern Mountains, or to caves 'far from home':

Kendel dennja sami matja

djeng pang€ran tirakat mring pasisir Pemantjingan kang djinudjug

munggah marang aldaka

Gunung Kidul Balimbing Palijan iku Sampar lawan ing Wulusan

tanapi ing gunung Giri,

lan guwa kang adoh omah

sarupané kang ageng lan kang alit.

Dipanegara also made frequent pilgrimages to caves in the vicinity of Jogjakarta. Tjakranegara relates that he visited the Sura Lanang cave, situated in the Southern 1

Canto IV, verses 39 a - 4O b.

and to the Giri mountain (Imagiri)

and to caves which were far from home both big and small.

 

80

1 Mountains, the Suleman save,” the Upas cave, west of the

3

Praga river,” and the famous cave at Silarong where Dipanegara was to declare himself Sultan.

Dipanegara's pilgrimages and his meditation in caves accord with the Sufiideal of fleeing from the world and worldliness by wandering in the desert. Like Ibrahim bin Adham who ‘went towards Iraq, wandering from land to land',> Sufis wearing their simple habits of wool went out from their homes and wandered over the Islamic world in their search for the spiritual realization of God. It has already been pointed out that Dipanegara's austerity and many of his religious practices and forms of mystical meditation seem to have been derived from Sufi practice, and this desire to wander about and live in caves accords equally well with Sufi doctrine. Thus it would seem that Dipane gara, like many other Javanese Muslims, was a follower of one of the Sufi orders and practiced the tenets of the mystical school of Islam.

It was the renowned devotion to Islam and Sufi mysticism that won for Dipanegara the support of that “section of the population of Jogjakarta wholeheartedly

devoted to Islam. In his study of a twentieth century Central Javanese town, Clifford Geertz was able to identify three distinct socio-religious groupings in Javanese society. These he named the santri, abangan and prijaji groups. The santri group were strict followers of the Islamic faith.

The abangan element were nominal Muslims but still adhered to customary beliefs and practices, many of which were pre-Islamic or pre-Hindu. The prijaji were the elite bureacracy descended from the Javanese nobility. They adhered to the Hindu-Javanese tradition though they also were nominally Muslim. Javanese society has in all probability displayed the same divisions since the introduction of Islam. It is not difficult to discern them in Jogjakarta society as portrayed by Tjakranegara. Dipanegara associated almost exclusively with the santri element, and they in turn looked to Dipanegara as the leader of the Islamic community. Many came to consider him as the Chief of Religion, a title normally reserved for the king. When the pangulu (chief) of the Islamic community, Rahmanudin,was replaced on the orders of the enemies of Dipanegara in the name of Sultan Menol, many of the Islamic scholars and lawyers refused to recognize the validity of new appointment In this they were encouraged by

Scanto V, verses 9-10, 

82

was eventually resolved by Dipanegara being regarded as

king and chief of religion, and it was Dipanegara who affirmed the appointment of the new pangulu, Kamalodiningrat, and not his nephew who was supposedly king. Thus around Dipanegara there polarized a clique which was strongly Islamic and which also sought the extension of Muslim ethics throughout the court and kingdom. Dipanegara was, as has been shown, inclined to the Islamic faith and was devoted

to it. This incidentally won him the support of one of the most important groupings within Jogja society, when the time came for him to rise against the court. For this santri group, the Java War may well have been a holy war against all unbelievers, Dutch and Javanese alike.

Though Dipanegara's devotion to Islam must be seen first of all for the honest piety that it was, one must also take account of a second role such devotion could have played when viewed in the context of traditional Javanese politico-religious theory. Non-santri elements in Jogja society in the nineteenth century still believed in spirits, protective gods and goddesses, invulnerability, divine intervention and the ability of mortal men to obtain supernatural powers and win success through tapa (asceticism and meditation). Dipanegara's love of meditation in seclusion, his pilgrimages to caves and mountains, and his religious zeal can therefore be seen in a traditional and non-Islamic light. According to traditional Javanese beliefs

the rebel in Java was a man who had to be possessed of great 

83

supernatural powers so as to ensure victory and gain

invulnerability for his supporters. This power was won by

religious devotion: The felt need for inner strength and unquestionably also for magical powers (especially invulnerability) made it natural that in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the initiative to revolt should most often be in the hands of gurus and kyais, men who by virtue of their religious life had already acquired the reputation for possessing supernatural or at least more than human capacities.t

Javanese history records how many aspirants to the throne avoided the capital and by meditating in caves and forests gained the power to seize the throne.

Moreover the Southern coast of Java has important mystical connotations for the Mataram dynasty. It was on the shores of the Southern (Ind ian) Ocean that Sénapati himself meditated with such vigour that he won the protection of Njai Rara Kidul, the spirit queen of the Southern Ocean. In marrying her, Sénapati also enlisted her support for his descendants. Each king of Mataram and each pretender to the throne had in turn to seek her approval and, having gained it, marry her. Thus the kings of Mataram were assumed to have two kratons, one in the capital and one on the shores of the Southern Ocean where they resided with Njai Rara Kidul. Dipanegara's pilgrimages to the Southern Ocean, as

described by Tjakranegara, could therefore be seen as his

courting of Njai Rara Kidul in order to gain her favours

1

S. Moertono, op.cit., p.80. 2

e.g. Airlangga: see also Moertono, op.cit., pp.79-80, 

84

prior to his rebellion, so that with the help of her armies of spirits, it would succeed. Though Tjakranegara in his account of Dipanegara's pilgrimages to the Southern Mountains and the shore of the Southern Ocean, does not mention the intervention of Njai Rara Kidul, Dipanegara in his autobiographical babad not only describes a meeting with this lady, but also relates how she bestowed her blessings on his future kingdom in Java.t Tjakranegara prefers to signal Dipanegara's prospects for kingship with signs much less propitious than intervention by Njai Rara Kidul. However the stories which must have circulated in

Jogjakarta in the years before the outbreak of war regarding Dipanegara's wanderings, where before him Sénapati had met and won the favour of the future protectress of his dynasty, must surely have signalled to many Javanese still influenced | by the old beliefs that Dipanegara was preparing himself

for rebellion in a time honoured way. He may in this manner have won the support of many abangan Javanese who looked on him as the one well prepared with magical powers and invulnerability for the task of rebellion, as one who had properly courted his potential protectress, and even as the true Messiah, the true Erutjakra, The additional aspect

of Dipanegara's pretensions to Messiah-hood are examined in the next section, but it is sufficient to state here that Dipanegara's devotion to religion as portrayed in our Javanese source may well have won support for his cause from outside the Islamic community and particularly among the

superstitious and tradition-minded peasantry.

B Dipanegara and Javanese Messianic Traditions

The yearning for a Messiah is common to many peoples. In times of war, famine and disorder, when it would seem that the world is soon to end, prophets inevitably appear proclaiming the imminent arrival of the Messiah. At his arrival, the Messiah is to save the virtuous from the horrors of the final destruction of the world, and restore to them the 'golden age! our ancient forebears once enjoyed.

The concept of the Messiah is familiar to Christians through the prophecies concerning the second coming of Christ. From the earliest days of the Church, Christians have looked for the imminent return of Christ to his earthly kingdom. Muslims also have their Messiah, who is called the Mahdi.! The word Mahdi means 'guided one', and Muslims believe that the Mahdi, having disappeared circa 880 A.D., will one day come again to save the faithful. Mahdi's have appeared in many countries, including the Sudan.” Though the belief in the Mahdi is particularly strong in the Shi'a sect of Islam, it is also widely held amongst Sunnis, the orthodox sect of Islam.

Amongst the Javanese, Messianic expectations have been

particularly popular. The Javanese Messiah is known by

1 In the following pages many references will be made to Islamic Messianic traditions. See further, A. Guillaume, ‘Islam', 1966, pp.117, 120-1; Drewes, 'Drie Javaansche Goeroe's', 1925, pp.168-88; S. Hurgronje, 'Verspreide Geschriften", 1923, vol.I, essay III.

e.g. the 'Mad Mahdi' who defeated General Gordon at Khartoum. 

86

many names — in recent times the Messiah has been called the Ratu Adil, or Just King'. However, he has also been known under the names of Erutjakra, Si Tundjung Putih, Prabu Asmarakingking and even the Mahdi. Since the seventeenth century (and perhaps before) the indigenous messianic traditions surrounding the Ratu Adil have considerably augmented the amount of support dissident princes have rallied from among the populace. Prince Dipanegara sought popular support by claiming to be the Messiah, He was however only the last of several princes who took up arms against Mataram, claiming to be the Messiah, the bringer of the golden age.

Hindu and Buddhist messianic traditions have played a large part in the moulding of the Javanese traditions. From Sanskrit works such as the Puranas,” Javanese became familiar with and adopted into their own world view, the Hindu theory of the ages of the world and its final destruction. Indian philosophies generally held that the universe is alternately in a state of being or non-being. When the universe is first created, it is at its apogee. From that time on, however, it moves inexorably and hy degrees towards its final destruction. At the destruction of the Universe begins an equal period of non-existence, until once again the Universe is created in exactly the same

form as before. This alternation of equal periods of

1 . See J. Dowson, 'A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion', London, 1957. 

87

existence and non-existence was portrayed in mythology as days and nights in the life of the supreme god, Brahma. When he slept, the world slept. With him, creation awoke.

Within the periods of existence there were four distinct ages or yugas. Each was shorter and less desirable than the preceding yuga. The four ages were, in chronological order, the krta or golden age, the trta, dvapara and kali yugas. It is the kali-yuga, the worst of all four, in which we live at the moment. According to Hindu theorists writing as early as the beginning of the Christian era, one could already see signs of the imminent destruction of the universe which is due to follow the end of the kali-yuga. For example no one obeys the caste laws. Depravity is rife. Warfare, famine, disease are all too common.

Though the kings of today are not the kings of yore, yet a good and strong king could, for a moment, arrest the decline towards destruction and reinstitute a semblance of the golden age:

For he was clear-sighted as to the difficulties of protecting the world, such as it ought to be carried out in the age of Kali; he held firm to esoteric ceremonies and religious observances, firmly adhering to the Buddhist church, so as

to imitate the honoured kings of the past, in order to consolidate the prosperity of the world.'?

Le days and nights of Brahma were constituted by hundreds of thousands of human years.

“From the Nagarakrtagama, Canto 42, verse 3 b-d, trans. from Pigeaud, 'Java in the 14th Century', 1960, vol.III, p.48. 

 

88

A bad king on the other hand merely hastened the ultimate calamity and brought misery to his people: In the event of the king being intoxicated there arise grave evils: unrighteousness leading to admixture of the castes grows in extent: there is cold in the hot season and vice versa: there is drought as well as heavy rain: diseases overtake the people: comets make their approach, inauspicious planets are seen and various evil omens 1 portending the king's destruction are visible. For the Hindu, destruction was inevitable even for the gods, but rebirth and regeneration were likewise inevitable. Just as there was the night of Brahma, so must there be the day of Brahma. Life and history therefore consisted of a never-ending sequence of ‘rebirth and regeneration - decay destruction - non-existence - rebirth - decay -— destruction.' These Hindu and Buddhist concepts were current in Java for a considerable time, and may well have been introduced during the earliest influx of Indian thought into Java. As direct contact with Hindu and Buddhist states in India and Southeast Asia became more difficult as a result of Muslim and European incursions into the area, and as Islam became more powerful in Java itself, these purely Hindu (and Buddhist ) concepts no longer remained in currency in Java. They did nevertheless influence the later indigenous developments. For example the purely Javanese pralambangs (predictions) retain the Indian terminology for the four 1 = B.

detailed examination of the signs and omens which preceded the downfall of a king.

1 ages of the world (the yugas). One of the names of the Messiah, Erutjakra, may also prove to be derived from the

name Vairocana, one of the dhyani-buddhas of Mahayana

: 2 Buddhism. Moreover the Javanese seem to have transposed into

their pictureof history several of the Hindu concepts of time and history mentioned above.

Popular Javanese historical tradition, as epitomized by the pralambangs, holds that each kingdom of Java, past, present and future, can last only a set number of years, either 100, 80, 64 or 35 years. Despite the variation, the principle was always recognized that a kingdom had a set period of existence allotted to it. The end of one kingdom and the beginning of the next was sometimes set for the turn of a century. Thus in one version of the pralambangs, the kingdoms of Mataram, Padjang II (Surakarta), the kingdoms of the first Messiah, Tandjung Putih, and of the second, Erutjakra, began in the years 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 A.J? respectively, but only after the previous kingdom had demised." Thus a king knowing that his kingdom was about to end would often depart from his capital to make way for his

usurper-successor.

The derivation of Erutjakra is discussed at length below.

5 . As did Mangkurat II in 1600 A.J. (1677 A.D.). See Chapter II.

The period between the changes of power were often periods of disorder and devastation. This was particularly true of the periods preceding the coming of the Messiahs. This alternation of periods of disorder with regular kingdoms is reminiscent of the Hindu concept of the cycle of existence revolving between rebirth and destruction.

The concept of the specific duration of kingdoms is also similar to the Hindu belief that each of the four ages had a set but diminishing time span allotted to it.

These Hindu influences were later augmented by Islamic influences. It has already been pointed out that the name Mahdi is often used for the Javanese Messiah. The Mahdi's role as a 'just king' (Ratu Adil) and the promoter of religion has also been grafted onto the Javanese traditions. The influence of Islam on the indigenous predictions has however been marginal.

In the eighteenth century A.D. a new indigenous form of Messianic tradition developed in Java. This new genre is most often referred to as the pralambangs of Djajabaja, king of Kediri. Djajabaja is the reputed author of all the pralambangs, but this claim is impossible when one considers that Djajabaja is supposed to have reigned circa 100 A.J. (1000 A.D.), according to the Javanese traditions (the historical Djajabaja however was living in the eleventh

e.g. 'The islamization [of the Javanese predictions | is limited to a few features which include in the main the prophesying of a just king who shall rule over Java, and

shall in particular restore peace and justice and reinstate religion!. G. Drewes, op.cit., p.182. 

91

century A.D.), while the pralambangs began to appear only during the eighteenth century.! Thus much of what Djajabaja 'prophesies' is in fact history (or a Javanese view of it) masquerading as prophecy. Nevertheless each pralambang does have its portion of true prophecy expressing pious hopes for an imminent Messiah. It is this actual prophecy regarding the Messiah rather than the historical pro logue which has had the greater attraction for the Javanese. <. Published versions of the Djajabaja pralambangs are few. The text of the 'Serat Djaja Baja' appears in de Hollander's anthology of Javanese writing,” Raffles

3

included some examples in his 'History of Java',” as did

Winter in his 'Zamenspraken' In 1872 Wiselius described in detail the prophecies and their contents.” In 1889 Brandes published a prototype of the predictions with a

Dutch translation.

1

There is no evidence of the existence of the pralambangs in the intervening centuries. No copies of the pralambangs could have existed from the time of their supposed composition in the ninth, tenth or eleventh centuries to be exploited in the eighteenth century, for in the Javanese climate they would have quickly rotted and disappeared. 2

The text published by Brandes in 1889 is interesting for several reasons. First, it is extremely old, as evidenced by the fact that the last date mentioned which is identifiable as historical is 1640 A.J. (1715 A.D.). Also the second Messiah is supposed to come in 1800 A.J. (1871 A.D.), whereas all later pralambangs claim the first Messiah is to come in 1800 A.J. (1871 A.D.). The text also shows no Islamic influence. Its basic framework is to be found repeated in the later pralambangs supposedly written by Djajabaja, but nowhere in this particular text is Djajabaja mentioned. For all these reasons, the text has been considered the ‘prototype! of the later predictions.

The content of the prototype is summarised by the

present anihor as follows:

Java is first to see a number of kingdoms including Madjapahit, Giri, Demak and Padjang. Specific mention is made of Anjakrakusuma (Sultan Agung). His reign is said to be followed by disturbances arising out of succession quarrels.l In 1601 A.J. (1678 A.D.) the Messiah Erutjakra is to appear. He is to establish his residence in Madiun and institute a ‘golden age’, but for a shart time only, for in 1640 A.J. (1715 A.D.) he is to disappear. Disorder will return and the ‘prediction! is made that the princes will war against themselves.

1

The disturbances referred to are the attack of Trunadjaja on Mataram in 1677 A.D., and the expulsion of Amangkurat III from Kartasura by Pangeran Puger (later Pakubuwono 1). There were also various rebellions, including the Surapati troubles. These disturbances are attested to by Dutch sources and are historical. 2

The war between Pangéran Mangkubumi and Pakubuwono II which resulted in the splitting of Mataram may be meant here, but it may also be the product of the author's imagination. 93

A new Messiah Prabu Asmarakingking is to appear in 1800 A.J. (1871 A.D.) and the prophesy is made that he will institute 100 years of good government. The text ends with a reference to this second Messiah's 2 reign: 'Djaman iku muli kadi ing trita',

In the prototype a basic pattern is distinguishable

which is to be found in the later predictions:

 

EVENTS AS RELATED IN PROTOTYPE PATTERN

 

STABILITY AnD ORDER Or ‘GOLDEN AGE!

The later pralambangs fill out and embellish the pattern of the prototype and also provide a pseudohistorical prologue which introduces Djajabaja as the

revealer of the predictions. This prologue is usually in

the following Form: °

Ennis claim is manifestly unhistorical:

‘That age reinstitutes the trta age', J. Brandes, op.cit., p.387. The trta age is the second of the yugas. The krta age of course is the best of the yugas, and it is this age which most probably was ‘intended,

The following summary, based on a summary in Wiselius' article, is the author's own. 

94

Java was originally uninhabited until the Sultan of Rum! (Turkey) sent settlers there, with priests to exorcise the local spirits. 170 years later, God sent down the first king and thereby instituted the Djaman Tirta (Skt. trta-yuga 2), There followed a series of kingdoms similar to those in the prototype: Wirata, Ngastina, Prambanan, Mendang Kamulan.

In 800 A.J. king Djajabaja established his capital at Daha (Kediri). During his reign there arrived

a sheikh from Rum, who taught him the secret sciences contained in the Kitab Musarar. From this sheikh Djajabaja learnt that only three of his descendants would rule over :Daha, whereafter this kingdom would disappear and be replaced by another. Djajabaja was also told of the seven future periods of Javanese history.

The sheikh returned to Turkey, and Djajabaja continued to rule in Daha, He later paid a visit to the Buddhist priest Ki Adjar Subrata, who lived on Mt Pandan. The king was accompanied by his son. They were served seven dishes of food on their arrival, but no sooner was the food served than Djajabaja slew the priest, and the nun who had prepared the seven dishes. In his subsequent explanation to his son of his killing of the priest, Djajabaja revealed the future history of Java. The priest had been killed because he had dared to reveal the secrets of the Kitab Musarar, for the seven dishes were allegorical representations of the seven future periods of Javanese history.

Djajabaja'ts revelations of the future history of Java

are set out in the pralambangs in the following form:

1

The first period to follow Djajabaja and his three descendants is to be the narpati period, covering the kingdoms of Djenggala, Kediri, Singasari and Ngurawan, The end of this age is to be marked by war and fighting. Next comes

the period of Padjadjaran which, after 100 years, is to be torn apart by disputes. Peace returns

In the mention of Turkey, the Kitab Musarar and the sheikh,

we can see the intrusion of Islamic cultural elements, of which the prototype was free.

2

Again the tyta age is referred to, when it is the krta age, the true golden age, that is meant, 

95

with the establishing of the Madjapahit kingdom, which is to last 100 years. After Madjapahit's demise, Demak is to establish the Islamic religion in Java, but this kingdom's power is soon to be transferred to Padjang. The combined rule of Demak and Padjang is to be 99 years.

Mataram is to succeed to Padjang and it is described as a very powerful kingdom, But only three people shall reign there, and after 100 “years the kingdom will disappear in the face of wars among the princes, In the disorder following the fall of Mataram, sea-traders (Dutch and English) shall come to Java and divide the land. One division of the land will be a second kingdom of Padjang (Surakarta). This second Padjang will last 60 years and four kings shall reign before another period of disorder and bloodshed comes, Following the second Padjang, injustices are to abound, all moral precepts are to be abandoned, crops shall fail and storms. and floods devastate the fields. Two merchants of high rank are to oppress the people, only to disappear. Devastation is to return:

"But now is the end of that kingdom nigh. Solar and. lunar. eclipses, rain, wind, earthquakes, whirlwinds, and showers of ash shall come about... everywhere the enemy (the sea- traders) change their position. They become very powerful, many of them come to Java....'"

In the midst of all this destruction there shall come the first Messiah and he shall be~-called

Si Tundjung Putih (or Erutjakra).3 He is to restore peace and order to Java. He is to ‚disappear and disorder is to return.

tthe end of Mataram is variously set at 1650 A.J., 1670 A.J., or 1600 A.J. in the predictions. The latter date of 1600 A.J, agrees exactly with the Babad Tanah Djawi's date for the tend! of Mataram. The pralambangs’ references to the end of Mataram and ensuing disorder therefore concur to some extent with the historical fact of the attack of Trunadjaja on Mataram, which technically ended the rule of Mataram, and thereby initiated a series of Succession wars in Java.

*Wiselius, opecit., p.186.

2No firm tradition was ever established about the names of the two Messiahs. The names Si Tundjung Putih (White Water Lily), Erutjakra, Prabu Asmarakingking and Mahdi, were all used to refer to either the first or second Messiah or to both, without distinction, 

96 .

However Erutjakra shall come as the second Messiah. He shall have two residences, one in Arabial and the other in Madiun. He shall institute a period of good government and his reign will last 100 years. After that, there will come a series of kingdoms alternating with periods of disunity and disorder,

It may be opportune at this moment to examine the meaning and the derivation of the Messianic title, Brutjakra, which Dipanegara later assumed, Wiselius first suggested the meaning of Erutjakra to be 'good spear'. He took ‘eru-! to be derived from Arabic 'chairun' meaning good, and '-cakra' as in Javanese was taken to mean spear! 7 This meaning was immediately challenged by Cohen-Stuart.? Though uncertain, he felt that '-stjakra! may be derived from ‘cakravartin', a Sanskrit word for king. He also felt that ‘teru! came from Arabic 'chairun', and so he suggested the meaning 'good king', arguing that this was consistent with the Islamic idea that the Messiah was a 'Just King'.

Brandes in 1889 further contended that Erutjakra in fact meant 'jewel of the world': 'eru' meaning 'jewel' and 'tjakra', tworldt

There the matter rested until of when Pigeaud

proposed a radically different solution to the problem.” He

another example of increasing Islamic influence. Viselius, opecit., p.213.

“AB. Cohen-Stuart, 'Eroe Tjakra', BKI (1872), pp.258-88. “Brandes, op.cit., p.369.

“Th. P. Pigeaud, 'Erucakra-Vairocana', in India Antiqua, Leiden, 1947, pp.270-4. 

97

argued that Erucakra was derived from vairocana, one of the dhyani-buddhas of Mahayana Buddhism. 'Eru-', he contended was derived from 'vairo-', and he explained the change of '-cana' to 'tjakra' by claiming that in later centuries people were more familiar with the termination ~tjakra in connection with kings. Thus vairocana came to be Erutjakra. In 1960 he reaffirmed his theory in his work 'Java in the 14th Century" Philologically, Pigeaud's interpretation is the most convincing but it remains to be shown why the name of a dhyani-buddha should be chosen as a name for the Javanese Messiah. It may in fact hearken back to the days of Buddhist Majapahit, and have some connection with one of the illustrious kings of that period. As yet, however, only its derivation seems determined. It remains for future En research to demonstrate the reasons for its adoption.

From the point of view of dating,” the pralambangs can

be divided into four categories:

lah. P. Pigeaud, 'Java in the 14th Century', The Hague, 1960,

vol.iV, p.130.

2

One can date with relative ease the various Djajabaja predictions, or at least provide for them dating in the form of termini a quo. The writer of a pralambang usually made the distinction between actual and post-eventum prophecy clear, For example, a reference to the kingdom of Majapahit is obviously historical, When a pralambang refers to . Anjakrakusuma, it is not to be doubted that it is referring to Sultan Agung, the greatest king of Mataram. Often the veracity of facts mentioned can be attested to by the Dutch or other European sources. However at a certain point ina pralambang, ‘historical! references become manifestly mythical. 100 years of peace, 50 yéars of unending. turbulence, the Messiah himself, are clearly prophetic. By identifying and then dating the last historical facts mentioned ina pralambang, one can establish the earliest date at which that particular pralambang could have been composed. In this way one can attempt to provide dating in the form of termini a

quo e 

98

(i) pre-Gianti (pre-1755) pralambangs ii ost-Gianti " (ii) p

(iii) post-Java War "

(iv) post-1870 " The 'prototype' of Brandes is the only extant example of the pre-Gianti pralambangs. The claim that the ancient king Djajabaja composed the pralambangs is guite impossible when one considers that this earliest example of the pralambangs dates only from the period circa 1720 to 1755 A.D. This dating of the prototype has been calculated from the reference in the text to the 'disappearance'! of the first Messiah Erutjakra in 1640 A.J. (1715 A.D.). This is the last date mentioned, and subsequent details are largely unhistorical. The 'disappearance' of Erutjakra in 1640 A.J. should be compared with the historical fact of the exile of the rebel prince Pangéran Dipanegara Erutjakra I to the

Cape of Good Hope in 1618 A.J. (172J a.p.).

A

Pangéran Dipanegara Erutjakra 1 first appears in the Babad Tanah Djawi as Raden Mas Sengkawa,! one of the 12 children of Pangeran Puger. His adult name was Raden Mas Taruna.” On the occasion of his father's accession to the: throne he was given the name Pangéran Dipanegara.” When the realm was later threatened by many rebels including some

of his own brothers, his father ceded to him half the

kingdom of Kartasura, including all the land east of Mount 1 Lawu, The similarity between this and Arilangga's division 2 of the realm to avoid schisms is striking indeed:

I have already begueathed to your younger brother Dipanegara ... the country from Mt Lawu eastwards to the land of Blambangan. You have this country to rule between the two of you. But do not try to extend your rule westwards of the Lawu.3

Dipanegara I left Kartasura and travelled eastward to his new domain. He was crowned 'Panembahan Erutjakra Sénapati ing Alaga Ngabdur - Rahman Sahidin Panatagama!" and he set up his residence in Madiun, later to become the traditional residence of Erutjakra, the Messiah. However, he ignored the orders of his father and crossed westward from Mt Lawu in search of conquests. From this point. onwards Dipanegara I was doomed to defeat. Nevertheless he was possessed of very considerable divinity, a fact which is demonstrated when one of his servants Sasranegara died a horrible death after having had intercourse with his seven concubines:

The seven concubines (of Dipanegara) were

taken by Sasranegara. After three days the penis of Sasranegara began to swell and

burst. He cried and moaned, asking forgiveness

As the Nagarakrtagama explains, the kingdom of Airlangga was divided to prevent disputes among his sons. A priest was engaged to perform the division,

This is the traditional title of the kings of Mataram, save for the addition of the title Erutjakra. Prince Dipanegara I seems to have been the first to have used the title Erutjakra,

Tembajat, the burial place of Ki Pandan Arang.

The last mention of Dipanegara I in the Meinsma Babad Tanah Djawi describes his flight to Lumadjang in 1616 A.J. (1723 A.D.) in the company of his brother Pangéran Purbaya.” However from other babads it is known that he was captured and exiled to the Cape of Good Hope in 1648 A.J.{1725 A.D.) where he died.

_The identical title of Erutjakra held by the Messiah of the prototype and by Prince Dipanegara I, the fact that both had their residences in Madiun, the similarity of their fates (exile and 'disappearancet), and the closeness ofthe 1 :

101

two dates 1640 and 1648 A.J. in connection with their similar fates strongly suggest that the Messiah Erutjakra of the prototype and Prince Dipanegara Erut jakra I are one and the same. Therefore the prototype of Brandes can only have been written after the prince's exile, that is after 1648 A.J. or 1725 \a.D.

Later post-Gianti pralambangs mention the division of the realm by the 'sea-traders! and the establishment of a second Padjang (Surakarta) either in 1600 A.J. (1677 A.D.), 1650 A.J. (1725 A.D.) or 1670 A.J. (1745 A.D.). Again the dates do not wholly agree but the idea of the creation of a second Padjang in 1745 A.D., according to some versions, is apparently a reference to the Treaty of Gianti (1755 A.D.) which settled the succession disputes within the Mataram royal family by dividing the kingdom into two parts, Jogjakarta and Surakarta. This is the last historical fact to be mentioned by this type of pralambang, for after the division of the kingdom they prophesy gross disorder and lawlessness, though it is known from Dutch sources that the treaty of Gianti restored peace to Ceritral Java for many years. Therefore the terminus a quo for this type of pralambang can be set at + 1755 A.D.!

After the Java War (1825-30 A.D.), when Dipanegara's messianic mission had failed, new prophecies were formulated setting the appearance of the first Messiah in

1800 A.J. (1871 A.D.), and the appearance of the second in

1 Wiselius (Djaja Baja op.cit.). also states this.

ry

 102

1900 A.J. (1970 A.D.). Again, after 1871 A.D. passed without the appearance of even the first Messiah, further prophecies were formulated, in particular those of the budjangga Ranggawarsita. Many of these prophecies look forward to the appearance of the first Messiah in 1900 A.J. (1970 A.D.) and the second in. 2000 A.J., or even in

2100 A.J.

It has already been noted that, for a number of reasons, Pangéran Dipanegara Brut jakra I should be considered as the historical prototype of the Messiah Erutjakra. It would seem that around this prince, who first used the name Erutjakra, there were crystallized many messianic hopes current in the period 1670-1720 A.D. This period was disturbed by the rebellions of Trunadjaja 'in 1677 A.D.,of Pakubuwana in 1704 and of Pangéran Dipanegara I

and his brothers from 1719 to 1723. This long period of

disorder and chaos, it is suggested, produced the initial

impetus for the development of the pralambangan genre. Pangéran Dipanegara I seems to have played a politicoreligious role at this time for he is attributed with divine characteristics and his father Pakubuwana I is supposed by the Babad Tanah Djawi to have given him sway over all of Eastern Java. This politico-religious aura may explain why he was taken as the prototype of a Messiah. The fact remains that in the development of the pralambang literature in the early and middle eighteenth century A.D., the memory of Pangéran Dipanegara I and his abortive rebellion was

preserved in references to a first Messiah who comes to 

103 Java, establishes his residence in Madiun, but alas soon disappears.

One of the first princes after Dipanegara I to be influenced by the predictions of an Erutjakra was Pangéran Singasari." This prince had been making war against the Dutch and the Surakarta court before the Third Succession War (1746-56) .7 His centre was East Java and his capital was Kediri, Trunadjaja's former capital and a city closely associated with the Messiah. After the 1757 Treaty of Salatiga which brought peace to Central Java he continued his rebellion in East Java, aided by the descendants of Surapati, He soon took the title of Prabu Jaka and proceeded to establish a new capital at Madjapahit, the former. centre of a renowned kingdom. Later still he took:

the title Panembahan Erut jakra.° However, the Sultans of

tsources on this Pangéran Singasari are few. See A.C.Vreede, 'Catalogus van de Javaansche en Madoereesche Handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits-Bibliotheek', Leiden, 1892,pp.95-8. - J.K.J. de Jonge, 'De opkomst van het Nederlandsch Gezag over Java', The Hague, 1883, vol.B, pp.IX-XVII.

- H.J, de Graaf, 'Geschiedenis van Indonesié', The Hague/ Bandung, 1949, pp.272-3.

i.e. the war between Pangéran Mangkubumi and his brother Pakubuwana II.

 

 

3Pangéran Singasari, Pangéran Dipanegara Erutjakra I and Dipanegara II were the only rebels who overtly took the title of Erutjakra. Professor Shrieke however speaks of Pangéran Kad joran, a contemporary of Mangkurat II and Trunadjaja, as ‘appearing! to be an Erutjakra, but Professor Shrieke sees

the concept of Erutjakra merely as a descriptive label to stick on rebels of all kinds, whether they took the title or not. In this way he can claim that 'Trunadjaja, Pangéran Puger, Pangéran Mertasana and the aged panembahan of Giri, all manifested Erutjakra characteristics'. Such a diverse and unwarranted application of the title Erutjakra dilutes its messianic overtones and reduces it in meaning to 'rebel'. The use of the title Erutjakra should properly be restricted to those who claimed it. See B, Schrieke, ‘Indonesian Sociological Studies: Vol.II', Ruler and Realm in Early Java, pp.81-95. 

104

Jogja and Solo decided to move against him and pacify East Java. In this they were aided by the Dutch who feared English overtures in the extreme East of Java. The rebellion of Pangéran Singasari was not easy to suppress, but he was eventually captured in 1767 A.D. and he died a year later in 1768. Though Pangéran Singasari's rebellion was as abortive as that of Pangéran Dipanegara I, his use of the title Erutjakra may well have firmly established its fame and function within Javanese society. | The predictions of Djajabaja would seem to have become increasingly popular after the division of Surakarta in 1755, as the Dutch became increasingly powerful and as the power of the Javanese courts waned. These two factors made the appearanee of the Messiah, 'the regeneration of the realm', even more imperative. One can imagine the growing concern among Javanese literati in view of the continuing uncertainties about the future direction of the kingdom. This concern was augmented by the confusion and disillusion felt because of the deterioration of morals and standards of conduct, referred to in several contemporary works. Such deterioration was a certain indication of the imminent destruction of the kingdom. Many Javanese became sympathetic to the idea that there soon must come some holocaust which would eliminate all sinfulness and immorality. From this destruction there would rise the Messiah in the year 1800 A.J. (1871 A.D.), as foretold in

1 S. Moertono, op.cit., pp.16-52.

 

105

the prophecies of Djajabaja, and He would institute the Golden Age. The 1870's did in fact witness sporadic, religiously inspired rebellions in Central Java, and these disturbances first turned the attention of Dutch scholars to the source of their inspiration, the predictions of Djajabaja.- The year 1800 A.J. also had some significance for the opponents of Islam. The Serat Dermagandul, written in 1878/1879 A.D. saw the year 1800 A.J. as the end of 400 years of Islamic domination in Java,” and the beginning of a new ‘Buddhist! age.” Thus for the opponents of Islam, : traditionalists, and the devotees of the Messiah, the nineteenth century and the 1870's A.D. in particular were crucial.

In this atmosphere of doubt, frustration and, at the same time, heightened expectations, many in all classes came to believe that only through violent measures could there be a rejuvenation of Javanese society:

eeethis period immediately preceding the Java

War was considered a time of decline, a time in

which society lay in a state of abject inertia.

Should we not see the Java War, then, in its

‘five-year long serenity as a desperate effort to

Prince Dipanegara II shared the same concern for the future of Java, and he turned to the predictions to signal his opposition both to the Dutch and the incapable court of Jogja. In proclaiming himself to be the Messiah, Erutjakra, he was expressing a desire to regenerate the. state, its religion (Islam in his case) and its institutions. In accepting the Messiah's mantle in 1753 A.J. (1825 A.D.), Dipanegara ignored the timetable set out in the pralambangs, whereby Messiahs appeared only at the .beginning of centuries (1800 A.J. or 1900 A.J.). Yet this did not affect the amount of support Dipanegara as Messiah was able to rally amongst both superstitious abangan villagers and the people of the capital. As Tjakranegara says, people from town and village flocked to the defence of the Messiah. The unfurling of the banner of the Messiah aroused deep: feelings and found widespread support among the mass of frustrated and confused Javanese. The Javanese Messianic traditions must therefore be seen as making important contributions to the level of support that Dipanegara was able to maintain, and it may help to explain to some extent

the bitterness and length of the war that ensued.

107 CHAPTER V

TJAKRANEGARA'S VIEW OF THE CAUSES OF THE JAVA WAR

One of the aims of this work has been to determine whether the Javanese, looking at the war from their own unique perspective, could find causes for the war, different from those advanced by Europeans. In discussing the war, Europeans have assigned to themselves a principal part in the events leading up to the war and have referred to economic causes as paramount. It is interesting therefore to note that Tjakranegara in his largely factual account of events assigns Javanese to the principal roles and the Dutch are seen to play only a marginal part. Moreover he advances as sole reason for the war the ‚increasing conflict between two cliques at the Jogjakarta court leading to the. outbreak of hostilities.

The first clique was that of Dipanegara and his supporters. The senior position of Dipanegara in the kingdom of Jogjakarta should not be overlooked. He was a great-grandson of Pangéran Mangkubumi (Sultan Hamengku Buwana) who had founded Jogjakarta. He had been of great assistance to his father when the latter was appointed to the throne by the English in 1812. He had been offered the throne by his father but had refused, making way for his younger brother. When his nephew succeeded to the throne in 1822 he had acquired a great deal of seniority as one of the few remaining princes of royal blood. Only his uncle,

Pangéran Mangkubumi had more seniority and standing. Though 

108

Dipanegara did not reside in Jogja and tried to avoid the ‘corrupting! capital as much as possible, he nevertheless presented himself at court for consultations and state business, He considered that his opinions ought to be sought on state matters, and he chided the minister Danuredja for once not bringing to his attention the cession of lands to the Dutch. Thus in his own estimation, Dipanegara was a grandee of the kingdom who by virtue of his eminence should have had an important part to play in the formulation of state policy.

Aligned with Dipanegara was the Islamic (or santri) community in Jogjakarta. Islam had not yet become fully entrenched in Central and East Java, and the court of Jogja particularly neglected religion. Tjakranegara relates that Dipanegara himself wrote to the Queen Mother regarding the immoral education she was giving to his brother, Sultan Djarot.” Dipanegara considered that his brother had forgotten religion, for he called him to Tegalkedja to tell him stories of the deeds of evil kings of Arabia and Syria. In this situation where the court did not place a high value on religion, the leaders of the Islamic community turned to Dipanegara whose devotion to Islam and Sufi mysticism was renowned. From him they sought protection and through him they furthered the interests of Islam in Jogjakarta.

Canto II, verses 23-5.

 

109

Dipanegara was also able to rally considerable support

from among the abangan peasantry. Though of different

temperaments and beliefs, nevertheless the abangan peasantry

eagerly supported Dipanegara who was linked with the

Messiah and Brutjakra.! Dipanegara's pilgrimages and visits to caves and the Southern Ocean were inevitably regarded by this group as a proper preparation for royal power. Dipanegara was for them a highly magical and powerful person. Their devotion to Dipanegara was due to the strength of traditional pre-Muslim beliefs. The group supporting Dipanegara was thus a formidable combination of santri and abangan elements.

Opposed to the Dipanegara clique and anxious to preserve the status quo in Jogja was a group composed of the Ratu Ageng, the Queen Mother who was the chief queen of Sultan Radja and mother of Djarot; Wiranegara, a Balinese who held the rank of Major in the palace guard; and the patih (minister) Danuredja IV. As this group? represented the established power it had the support of the Dutch, which made the opposition of the Islamic clique of Dipanegara even more urgent. The Queen Mother was opposed to

Dipanegara because she feared that he had ambitions to seize

1

See above, Chapter IV,

in Canto IX, verse 11, line a, Tjakranegara also relates that a number of palace functionaries and noblemen joined his cause. Dipanegara's uncle, prince Mangkubumi, also joined him immediately before the outbreak of hostilities. 3

This group corresponds well with Ggertz's prijaji, the aristocracy and government functionaries. 

110

the throne from her son Djarot and, after Djarot's death, her grandson Menol. In this context she reviled Dipanegara as the son of a lesser wife:

Kelamun ta wajah mami

tan sida madeg. hadji

kasela kang dadi ratu

pangran Dipanegara

pan iku anaké selir. She had little reason in fact to fear Dipanegara's ambition. The latter had given up his opportunity to become king when he had recognized the stronger claim of his brother who, though younger, was the child of the Chief Queen. Dipanegara also agreed to the accession to the throne of his nephew. and placed no difficulty in the way of his coronation. He made one request only, that he be relieved of the duty to act as a guardian of his nephew so that he could continue his religious devotions. Nevertheless the Queen Mother suspected Dipanegara of ambitions on the throne and she manoeuvred to alienate all possible sources of support for his claims. The Dutch residents de Salis and Smissaert she easily won over. Wiranegara was completely her creature.

The patih Danuredja willingly allied himself with the

Queen Mother to achieve their joint aim of eliminating 1 Canto III, verse 60, d-h. If my grandson does not become king in his place prince Dipanegara will become king and he is the child of a lesser wife, 

111

Dipanegara. As patih, Danuredja already held a prominent position in the state hierarchy. However he aspired to a position of pre-eminence among the princes of the realm, which would have made him the most powerful man in the kingdom, for Sultan Menol was still only a child in the years 1822-5, In these ambitions he met the opposition of Dipanegara who regarded himself quite correctly as senior prince of the royal line and more worthy of such pre-eminence. Dipanegara's feeling of superiority towards Danuredja was further increased by the fact that Dipanegara had secured the appointment of Danuredja as patih in 1812. The fact that he had risen to a position of power through the good offices of Dipanegara served only to feed the jealousy and hatred of Danuredja for the prince. Danuredja was also quick to take offence at Dipanegara's continuing failure to pay courtesy calls to his home:

kelawan para pangéran

mring Danuredja pan samja iring

mung pangéran Dipanegari

tan kersa mring wismanipun,

The concept of the struggle between cliques for

pre-eminence in the kingdom is a familar concept in Javanese -.

history. The rebellion in 1810 of Radén Rangga

 

1 Canto III, verse 69, c-f. and the various princes, they all respected Danuredja only prince Dipanegara “had no desire to go to his home, 

112

Prawirjadirdja, provoked by the patih of Jogja Danuredja

IT conforms to the pattern. Raden Rangga, openly supported by the princes Natakusuma and Natadiningrat and covertly encouraged by Sultan Sepuh, was opposed to the further extersion of Dutch power in the kingdom. He was opposed by the patih who relied on the Dutch presence for self-preservation, and also by Dipanegara's father who had early ambitions to the throne. Raden Rangga was forced into rebellion when the patih secured from the Dutch an order that the prince go to Bogor to receive punishment for certain attacks he had made against the territory of Surakarta. The splitting of Mataram was similarly the result of a personal conflict between Pangéran Mangkubumi and his brother Pakubuwono II, wherein both engaged in a struggle for pre-eminence. The Javanese state with its autocratic court reflecting no real interest of the people, but rather the personal ambition of individuals, proved to be highly unstable. Power could easily shift from one personality or clique to another as temporary alliances were forged and broken. Thus rebellion and murder often brought about substantial change in personnel at the centre.

Tjakranegara traces the clear development of the conflict between Dipanegara and the Danuredja clique through several incidents which led up to the outbreak of hostilities on 20 July 1825. Tjakranegara also emphasises that it was Danuredja who sought to provoke Dipanegara into rebellion, so that he could be crushed by the Dutch, who

would support the established order. 

 

113

The first such incident of provocation occurred at the time of the accession of Menol in 1822, The coronation had been delayed while the resident de Salis sought permission from Batavia to relieve Dipanegara of his guardianship of Menol, The Queen Mother thought that Dipanegara might be planning to seize the throne and she began to cajole the resident into ordering an immediate coronation. Danuredja

supported her in this campaign. Thus Menol was crowned only

 

three days after the death of his father and in the absence of Dipanegara, who was at Silarong engaged in meditation. Dipanegara was horrified to learn soon after that he had not been informed of, nor invited to, the ceremony. Stunned, he locked himself in his house at Selaradja where he slept for three days and three nights. When he emerged he called together his closest advisors and his friends in the Muslim community to discuss this insult:

Déné saking kangdjeng kula

jen wus serat semajané puniki

sajektiné kula mantuk

dadak kula tinilap

pan seléntja lan rembagé wau-wau

lah puniku sabab napa

akarja malaning ati

kados mekaten punika

inggih akalé ibu lawan Danured jeki

lawan Wiranegareku |

amrih nepsu kawula

 114

kados pundi jen kula nuruti nepsu

pesti gegering Ngajogdja. The Muslim scholars he had assembled cautioned him not to respond to this provocation because this was.a test of God. They pointed out that he should beware of the temptations of the devil which counselled violence. He should put out of his mind discordant feelings of revenge for these present the realization of tauhid (Divine Unity) and ma'rifat (gnosis). Dipanegara accepted this advice and the matter was forgotten.

Danuredja soon conceived a new provocation. He and Wiranegara suggested to the new resident, Smissaert, that a road be built to connect the southern areas of Jogja with the highway that led north to Semarang. It was to pass through the western areas of the kingdom avoiding the capital. The road was also to pass through land belonging to Dipanegara and on which he had established a pleasure

garden. Smissaert agreed to the proposal in principle, but

 

1 canto IV, verses 17 a - 18 f. It was my intention that when the letter (in reply) had come (from Batavia) I would certainly return to Jogja.. Suddenly I am pushed to one side what had happened is not in accordance with the former advice. Why should they cause sorrow in my heart? This must be | the trick of my mother and Danuredja together with Wiranegara they try to make me angry but what would happen if I acted on my anger surely Jogja would be torn asunder.

suri goals. 3canto IV, verse 59. 

115

warned Danuredja that he should first obtain the permission of Dipanegara before commencing work." Danuredja and Wiranegara had no intention of seeking the prince's permission. Tjakranegara continues on to describe how Dipanegara was resting in his pleasure garden when he caught sight of workmen driving stakes into his land. The gardener informed him that they were the servants of the patih and were under the supgrvision of Bratakusuma. Dipanegara was incensed and he ordered the gardener to pull up all the stakes, and if any person resisted, he was to be hit on the head. Bratakusuma and his men were quickly dispersed with sore heads and a report was made to Danuredja. Danuredja eagerly informed the Resident of Dipanegara's rebellious behaviour, but Smissaert recognized that there had been provocation and the matter was dropped:

Bijen ingsun wus wekas

den abet jik mring pangéran sidji iku

samubarang ing prakara

rembuga dipun ararih

iku sigra Bratakusuma

tanpa tembung denira masang andjir

bener kang naboki iku.?

 

Tanto IV, verses 55-7. 2 Kanto IV, verse 67 d = 68 c.

Formerly 1 (Smissaert) told you (Danureaja) to be polite towards this one prince,

all matters

should be discussed peacefully with him Bratakusuma

set out stakes without permission

he deserved a knock on the head. 

116

The hostility between Dipanegara and Danuredja increased appreciably when on a later occasion Dipanegara struck Danuredja on the cheek with a slipper. Dipanegara had summoned Danuredja to explain the cession of the © Redjawinangun sawahs to the Dutch.” The patih replied flippantly and Dipanegara struck in order to remind him of his proper station:

Umatur raden Dipatja

ririh sendu pinirsa sumengit

gya sinampluk uwangipun

lan agemé tjenéla

sanget kanggeg wirangé sadjroning kalbu

katah djalma kang wuninga. Danuredja dwelt on this humiliation for some time, and in self-defence he drew closer to the Dutch, gaining their confidence and support. Tjakranegara makes the interesting comment that in the months immediately prior to the outbreak of the war Danuredja became increasingly friendly towards the Dutch, while Dipanegara stood aloof, concentrating on meditation and his religious pursuits: Perhaps the Djabarangkah lands ceded in January 1825. This

was only seven months before the outbreak of hostilities. 2

Canto IV, verse 73 a-f. The minister replied he was joking, but Dipanegara took it seriously (the patih) was struck on the cheek with a slipper he felt very ashamed because there were many people who saw it. 

 

117

Danuredja raket Walanda djeng pangéran semu tebih eee radjaputra karsanipun donja akérat antuka.

The Dutch responded to the overtures of the patih, and began to interfere extensively in the affairs of state. Dipanegara was not asked to participate in government, and he became increasingly concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of Danuredja and the Queen Mother, who had allied themselves with the Dutch:

Narpaputra tyas kagugu ginugu saja ngranuhi gerahé werdajanira

sabab déning ibu sori sabarang-barang prakara Danuredja Wiranegari

lan Welenda kang kinantjan

narpasiwi tan tinari.

1

Canto IV, verse 77 f-g and verse 79 c-d. Danuredja drew close to the Dutch while the prince seemed far off ' his (the prince's) one desire was to attain [prosperity |] on earth and hereafter. 2 Canto V, verses 49 a - 50 b, The more the prince followed his heart the more he was sick in his heart because his mother discussed all the affairs of administration with Danuredja and Wiranegara and the Dutch who were made allies, The prince was not asked (to contribute). 

118

Tjakranegara did not hesitate to brand the growing power of this clique as destructive of religion and harmful to the well-being of Mataram:

dadi kompro kang nagari tatané agama rusuh | wit saking rekjana patih kelawan Wiranegara rina wengi ngorak-arik tan pisan ngambah agama. Dipanegara also looked on the increasing power of the Dutch with some concern: Welanda iki lawas-lawas jen saja gung tamtuné jen telas bumi ing Ngajogja kijé kena kabeh dawuhé marang Welanda.?

Within this atmosphere of mutual hate and distrust, and as Dipanegara was progressively alienated from the court and, more importantly, from the Dutch, Danuredja began to spread false rumours of Dipanegara's intention to rebel. These rumours were initiated by the Queen Mother:

1 Canto V, venses 51 f - 52 f. The state is in a bad way the rules of religion are flouted;

this is due to the minister Danuredja and Wiranegara

they destroy the rules of religion and they do not pay heed to religion. 2. Canto VI, verse 14. The Dutch become increasingly powerful the country of Jogja will certainly fall into Dutch hands,

 

119

Danurdja ngandikan agé

malbeng pura rembug lan dajinta nata

angandika wau kangdjeng ratu ibu

heh, paran kang warta,

Dipanegara sing mangke kang

sun angrungu arang-arang saba wisma

neng Silarong .....

angadeg kraman kareps.! Danuredja immediately conveyed this rumour to Smissaert, hoping that the Dutch would take guick action against Dipanegara who reputedly wished to 'Angadeg kraman' (rebel). Smissaert however made no reply, evidently aware that this 'news' of imminent rebellion was no more than a ploy of the minister to achieve the crushing of Dipanegara by means of Dutch armed strength.

It was at this time that Dipanegara, according to Tjakranegara, sent out his servants to search for signs. These pilgrimages confirmed his apparent premonition that a war was imminent and inevitably he was to play a part in it, but his success was uncertain. Tjakranegara also claims that these signs aroused in Dipanegara the resolve to fight

his enemies and the 'Kafir! Dutch, In this resolve to

 

1 Canto VI, verses 5c = 7 Ce The minister Danuredja entered the palace and talked with the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother said: "Hey, what is the news about Dipanegara? I hear rumours from his residence that in Silarong ..... he desires to declare himself a rebel".

 120

fight, Dipanegara inevitably turned to Islam for inspiration. He is depicted by Tjakranegara as linking his projected rebellion against the court and their allies, the Dutch, with the support of religion and ‘the carrying out of the laws of the Prophet!:

keraos-raos ing drija

kaja paran déningsun djumeneng adji

aneng pradja Mentaram

jèn Welanda melu amengkoni

banget geseh lan daliling kitab

..... jen wis takdiripun

jen ingsun dadi djalaran

panedaku mring Allah kang Mahasutji

muga sun tinrimaa

djumenenga naléndra agami,

madeg ana ing rat nusa Djawa

babon anglakonaké

saraké kang djeng Rasul

adja tjampur lawan wong Kapir.!

tcanto VIII, verses 16 h- 18 e. The prince thought on these things: "Perhaps I shall be king ruling over Mataram. If the Dutch meddle in affairs of state this is in conflict with the words of the Kur'an, see... if it is God's will | that I be the cause (of great destruction in the kingdom) I pray to God the all-Holy that I be accepted as the Chief of Religion ruling over the island of Java! It shall be my task to carry out the sjariah (law) of the Prophet and to avoid contact with the Kafirs (unbelievers)."

 

 

121

In this way Dipanegara came to accept that the growing conflict between his group of Islamic traditionalists and the group of Danuredja supported by the Dutch could be resolved only by violent rebellion. This had been accepted long before by Danuredja who had plotted the destruction of Dipanegara by provoking him into rebellion and using Dutch forces to suppress him. Danuredja had so far failed to impress upon the Dutch the need to suppress Dipanegara by force. The Dutch had ignored his rumours and had seen through his provocations. So far they had failed to detect any rebellious behaviour on the part of Dipanegara. Two incidents, which were the result of misunderstandings, were to convince the Dutch that Dipanegara did in fact have rebellious intentions. On two occasions Smissaert invited Dipanegara to parties. The first was in the Residency itself, and the second was held at Smissaert's country home at Bedaja. On each occasion Smissaert required that Dipanegara not bring armed servants with him. This stipulation aroused Dipanegara's suspicions and he feared that the Dutch intended to seize him. Thus on both occasions he took with him an armed escort and declinedto go inside to join the Resident and his party. Because Dipanegara had been accompanied by an armed escort and also refused to join him, Smissaert began to give credence to

“the rumours of Dipanegara's rebellious intentions.

At the same time, Dipanegara also became convinced of

the Dutch resident's intention to seize him. Tjakranegara

relates how he gave increasing weight to the rumours that 

122

the resident, in league with the prince Paku Alam, Danured ja and Wiranegara, intended to attack Tegalredja. This growing fear only strengthened his belief in the necessity fora preventive war, which had already taken on the aspect of a Holy War on behalf of the Prophet and God Almighty:

Wikan dalu atanapi sijang

osiking tjas wis pestiné

Allah kang Mahagung

ingsun murwa ing perang Sabil

lah ija pati apa

manungsa den luru

kedjaba pati utama

donja akérat wus midak saréngat Nabi

karsané Allahtangallah.!

Dipanegara therefore began to prepare the defences of Tegalredja against attack. All males in Tegalredja were ordered to be armed and to stand guard at night. He also called on all the people from surrounding villages who supported him to join the people of Tegalredja in standing guard over him at night. Soon 300 people assembled at Tegalredja each night to protect the prince. During the day

however they would disperse to their homes.

 

toanto VIII, verse 31 b - j.

Day and night

he thought to himself: "It is predestined

by God Almighty

that I should begin a Holy War,

Indeed, what sort of death

is sought by Man?

‘Surely it is a glorious death

in this world and the next I follow the religion of the Prophet.

It is the will of God Almighty."

 

 

123

As Tjakranegara himself says, it was ‘unavoidable! that news of this nightly assembly of armed supporters of the prince soon reached the capital. Danuredja learnt of it from the spies he had sent to Tegalredja and the news was relayed to Smissaert. In the tense atmosphere that had developed the initial reports of armed villagers gathering at Tegalredja to protect the prince were exaggerated until it was generally rumoured that in the month of Sura! Dipanegara would leave.the capital and declare himself king at Silarong:

Geder gumrah sapradja Mentaram mundak-mundak pawartané

kang djeng pangéran tamtu ngadeg kraman nggitik negara pand jangé kang pawarta sapradja misuwur

karsané kangdjeng pangeran

1 < . The month of Sura is the first in the Muslim year. In 1825 A.D. the month of Sura began on the 15th or 16th of August. (The Islamic lunar months are shorter than the Christian solar months, and thus occur at different times each year when compared with the Christian calendar). The striking of Danuredja by Dipanegara, it is suggested, occurred in January at the time of the cession of the Redja Winangun lands (see above), The war began on 20 July. These rumours of rebellion in August may therefore have been current as early as February 1825 or as late as June 1825. Events moved quickly after the spreading of these rumours, and therefore May-June 1825 is suggested as the more likely period for the generation and spread of the rumours.

 

124

wulan Sura wedalé saking negari neng Silarong madeg nata.

Dipanegara on hearing these rumours that he intended to rebel and declare himself king in the month of Sura was no longer disturbed at the prospect, in fact he accepted the rumours as God's call to battle:

Radjasunu mupusing galih

ija kinapakena

djer saderma iku

kabeh kang agawé warta

mobah-mosik atas Allah kang akardi

mangsa sun undurana. It would seem that Dipanegara then accepted the month of Sura as the time for his rebellion as had been rumoured, for Tjakranegara states that his supporters had received an order that they were to assemble on the night of the seventh of the month of Sura (24 August 1825 A.D.) for an attack on

the capital:

 

tcanto VIII, verse 35. “(The rumours) spread wildly through the whole of Mataram these rumours increased, (they say) the prince will certainly rebel and attack the capital the rumours were exaggerated and were known throughout the kingdom, (they say) the prince in the month of Sura will depart from the capital and will declare himself king at Silarong.

“Canto VIII, verse 36 e-j. The prince was composed in his heart: "What can I do? Those who spread the rumours are all mortal beings all living creatures are subject to the will of God I cannot argue."

 

125

Dawuhé pangéran

sampun wradin sedaja

pada pepaka

... d€sa lan negara

pan dereng prapta." Dipanegara also began to make overt military preparations appointing friendly village heads as his temenggungs (commanders). He also sent letters to surrounding villages calling on the people to join his army. As well as villagers, townspeople and soldiers in the royal army came

to Tegalredja in support of Dipanegara. An indicator of

lganto IX verses 12 c - 14 f.

ee. people from the villages and the capital

awaited the promised day

they awaited the month of Sura

but this had not yet come, Dipanegara's orders were more explicit than the rumours, specifying the seventh day of the month of Sura. Since Sura began 15-6 August in the year 1825 this puts the projected _ assembly of his supporters at 23 August and their subsequent attack on Jogja on-24 August. This is a month before the actual outbreak of hostilities, which would suggest that the Dutch and the court did in fact decide on a surprise pre-emptive attack. 

126

the wide spectrum of support rallied by Dipanegara is the mention by Tjakranegara of Buginese soldiers (daéng) joining the army at Tegalredja. In fact, Dipanegara gathered supporters from most sectors of the kingdom:

Dalu katah djalma prapti

désa mjang pradja

tuwin abdi pradjurit

es. Suranata sami prapti

pradjurit Pantjas

daéng prasami prapti.!

There can be little doubt. that Tjakranegara believed that Dipanegara had planned to rebel. The seventh of the month of Sura was, according to him, accepted by Dipanegara. and acknowledged by his opponents as the date for the commencement of his rebellion. Although it is recognized that Dipanegara planned a rebellion, Tjakranegara clearly states that Dipanegara had been subjected to provocation and threatening rumours before he determined on a Holy War, almost as an act of self-preservation.

In Canto IX, Tjakranegara provides a graphic picture of the three days that directly led up to the war.? These three days were filled with negotiations, and hasty En

preparations for war by both sides, On 18 July Smissaert

 

tcanto IX, verses 9 e~g and 11 e-g.

By night many people came

returned from his country residence at Bedaya." He had been forced to return because of disturbances in the region, probably caused by the call to arms sent out by Dipanegara. He returned to a capital in fear of an attack from Dipanegara. There were firm indications that such an attack might come on 24 August, a month away. Many had already left the capital to join the prince, while many in the native armed forces had gone over to the prince's side. Noblemen too had allied themselves with Dipanegara. Though the situation had possibly deteriorated too far for conciliation Smissaert nevertheless tried to retrieve it

by sending an envoy, Sindunegara, to Tegalredja-calling on the prince to come to the Residency to discuss the reasons for his discontent.

Dipanegara rejected two missions from Sindunegara on the 18th and 19th, anda mission by his uncle Pangeran Mangkubumi. on the 19th resulted in the latter joining the rebels! cause. By 20 July, Smissaert had become convinced that prince Dipanegara could be subdued by force alone. Thus on the morning of the 20th a force of Javanese and Dutch soldiers were prepared and set out to disperse the supporters of Dipanegara and arrest him in order to avert a war. Danuredja and Wiranegara led the Javanese forces, undoubtedly overjoyed that the Dutch had at last been. forced to arrest Dipanegara. .

1 P,H. van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', op.cit., p.391.

 

 

128

As they set out on that morning the Dutch were certain of victory, and Danuredja perhaps visualized the imminent exile of Dipanegara to the Outer Islands, just as former rebels had been exiled to Ceylon or the Cape of Good Hope. It is clear however that both the Dutch and the Danuredja/ Queen Mother clique had seriously underestimated the support that Dipanegara had rallied. Dipanegara's reputation as a Holy Man and the aura of a Holy War against the unbelievers had won support from devoted Muslims, while Messianic: beliefs and the hope for a new Erutjakra had also won over traditionalist and superstitious villagers.

In the battle at Tegalredja the forces of Dipanegara were dispersed, but the prince himself escaped. His supporters were to rally at Silarong where the rumours of the preceding months were proved true. Here Dipanegara called upon the people of Java to rebel, and he was declared Sultan of Mataram and the Messiah Erutjakra.

For his opponents in the court, their plans had failed badly. The subjugation of Dipanegara was to take five years. In Tjakranegara's view of the cause of the war, the personal conflict between Dipanegara on the one hand and Danuredja and the Queen Mother on the- other, had led to division and polarization within Javanese society, which had given way to open warfare, In his estimation the patih of Jogjakarta, Danuredja, had been the evil genius who forced this personal conflict to the point of war, The Dutch had

been drawn into the conflict as an instrument of Danuredja

 

 

129

and the Queen Mother. However at the conclusion of the lengthy war, only the Dutch could claim victory. Dipanegara had been sent into exile, as his enemies had desired, but Danuredja, who had used the Dutch as his instrument before the war, had been reduced to impotence

by the Dutch and had become no more than their puppet.

PRINCIPLES OF TRANSCRIPTION OF KITLV OR 13

The system of spelling used is that generally adopted

for romanised Modern Javanese.

As far as possible spelling inconsistencies have been eliminated from the transcription. A number of irregularities regarding spelling in the MS., which have been removed from the transcription, should be noted: (a) [èl ana [é] are not distinguished; (b) [a] and [d] are not often distinguished. (d) is used regularly in the MS. for (d); (c) (a) in open syllables is often represented by Lo]; (d) for the suffix (-iréki), MS. regularly has [-ereki];(e) (a) is used at the beginning and end, and in the middle of words to separate vowels. The transcription has been given verse and canto numbers. A Variae Lectiones follows the transcription. Where amendments have been made to the MS., there appears an asterisk which refers to the Variae Lectiones. Comments on metre are placed as footnotes to the text. A summary of metres used, with notes,is placed after the transcription.

An English summary of the transcription is appended.

'Warga' has the meaning six, which when taken with resi (7) ‘and ningrat (1) gives 1-7-6-3 as the chronogram. This means 1835 A.D., an impossible date for the event referred to. However if 'warga' is read as warna (warna) (and the symbols for (g) and (n) are similar enough to allow for a copyist!s error) then 'warna' which has the value 4 gives the chronogram 1-7-4-3, which is 1814 (1815 A.D.).

OF THE TEXT*

Numbers next to paragraphs denote the verse number from which the summary begins. A paragraph may summarise more than one verse. 

 

263 CANTO I

Introduction:

1) I am delighted to begin this story of Prince Dipanegara, Jt am pleased to copy this work for I, a Javanese gentleman living in Semarang, am in jail. 3) I am Mas B2hi Suranegara, an excellent patih of Semarang. 5) I began to copy this work in the year Tata-lawang-adjaringwong (1866 A.D.), TI am copying the work of the bupati of Purwared ja»,

6) The bupati has been promoted to the rank of raden dipati. It is the Dutch who have promoted him. He wrote

this story in the year Bumi-ardi-resi-sid ji (1843 A.D.).

8) This story begins when the kingdom of Mataram (Jogjakarta) was visited by the punishment of God. The country was visited by a devastating storm and all the ulamas, santris and pangulus prayed that it might abate, but without success.

13) Because of the arrival of God's judgement the

reigning king (Sultan Sepuh) was exiled from the country and

1

In traditional Javanese literature wars, famine and natural disasters were depicted as the visitation of God's anger

and punishment. God's anger was normally brought against the evil kings who ruled at the end of a millenium. Thus in Tjakranegara's estimation this particular disaster visited upon Sultan Sepuh presaged the end of Mataram. Many other signs were to confirm this. The 'storm' referred to here, and the visiting of God's punishment on Java, are poetical allusions to the invasion of Java by British forces in 1811, under the leadership of Governor Raffles, | 

264

his son succeeded him with the title Sunan Radja.! This king had sinned against his father.

14) Sunan Radja had two sons. The eldest was born of a minor wife and his name was Pangeran Dipanegara. The name of his younger son by the chief gueen was Raden Mas Bagus Suradja.

16) When his rule was established the king felt pity for his eldest son and called him to his presence. He declared that Dipanegara was to be made Crown Prince because it had already been promised to him, ° and his brother moreover was still young and incapable of ruling.

20) Dipanegara however tearfully requested that his younger brother be made Crown Prince. The king agreed to this request and he offered Dipanegara rich lands in return, but the prince refused even these.

38) The king informed General Buntermas? (the ruler in Batavia) of his decision to appoint his younger son Raden Mas Bagus, Crown Prince. 18) General Buntermas agreed to

this and returned to Batavia.

 

1

1812 A.D. 2

See Chapter II, History of Mataram. 3

The name Buntermas would seem to be derived from Thomas, the christian name of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the Lt.-Governor of Java from 1811 to 1816. While in Java, Raffles became closely involved with events at the Jogjakarta court. The nomination of Raden Mas Bagus as Crown Prince occurred between 1812 and 1814 (the year of his accession to the throne on the death of his father) and the English were ruling Java at this time. Raffles would therefore have been in a position to approve this elevation to the position of Crown Prince. 

 

265 CANTO IL

1) The king of Jogja soon came to regret his actions in helping the Welanda” exile of his father. In return for English assistance he had given away lands in Kedu and the and the Mant janegara.* For these reasons he was sad in his heart, contemplating the destruction of his kingdom.

4) “The king called his younger son the Crown Prince to his side and called on him to obey his elder brother Dipanegara, The king related how Dipanegara, when offered the position of Crown Prince, gave it up in favour of his younger brother. He then repeated his order that Dipanegara be obeyed. He also warned his son of Dipanegara's dislike of the Dutch: ‘Your elder brother I have ordered to obey the President but he still desires to oppose the Dutch.' (7, e-f).

8) When he had been on the throne three years, the king went riding on horseback in the alun-alun (square). As he was making his third circuit of the square ‘he became very sick. He trembled and began to sweat. He was immediately carried into the palace but he died.

11) All the religious scholars and teachers assembled

in the Sri Menganti hall and prayed for the king. In the

tthe Javanese word for Dutchmen, but Tjakranegara uses it

consistently to refer to the English.

The Mantjanegara were the outlying areas of the kingdom of 'Mataram' (Jogja-Surakarta), including the areas of Madiun, Magetan, Panaraga, Blitar and Kediri. The distinction was maintained in Java between the outer and inner precincts of the kingdom. See further S, Moertono, op.cit., pp.111-8, 'Territorial division of the Realm'. 

266

presence of Hadji Hedrim, the Chief of the hadjis,! the body was washed. The ceremonies over, gifts were distributed

to the mourners; the Chief of the Islamic religion received nine rials, the anom ketibs? three rials, the djadjar ketibs two rials, and all the hadjis and the mod ins? each received one rial. The poor also received alms.

13) One modin reflected that the death of the king had brought him prosperity. For three days his child had not eaten, but now he had one ringgit as his fee for praying for the dead Sultan. He took the money home to his wife who eagerly took it and said, smiling: 'O my husband, great are the blessings which fall on us because the Sultan has died,'

18) The palace awaited the arrival of a messenger from Batavia with a letter confirming the Crown Prince's

5

elevation to the kingship. Twenty days~ after the death of

the former king the letter came and the Crown Prince was

6 . made king. His reign name was Sultan Bagus.

Surely a veiled comment on the evils of the Sultan's reign. 5 Tn Sultan Raja died on 3.11.1814 and Sultan Djarot was installed as his successor on 16.11.1814. Thus the actual delay seems to have been 13 days, and not 20 as stated here. 6 .

The chronogram given in the text is 'Telu-warnaning-resi ningrat', which is 1743 A.J. This gives the year 1814/15 A.D. Western sources reveal that Sultan Bagus (Djarot) became king in 1814 A.D. (c.f. Note 5 above). See verse 19, line 6. Ka 7

He is better known as Djarot.

 

267

21) The new king was just reaching adolescence and his mother spoilt him a great deal. He was given young princesses as companions and his nurse was ordered to instruct him (in sexual matters). Dipanegara soon heard of this and was very angry.

23) He sent a letter to the Queen Mother complaining that the young king should not be educated in such things, because it would cause the degradation of the kingdom. She answered the letter immediately, agreeing to all that Dipanegara had said.

27) When he came of age, the king married, and the princess he chose was the daughter of the Danuredja who had been murdered in the kraton by Sultan Sepuh." They loved each other and lived harmoniously.

29) One day the king ordered all his soldiers to wear Dutch uniforms.

30) When the king went out in his carriage for a pleasure ride, he was accompanied by 200 soldiers all dressed in Dutch uniforms, 100 preceded the carriage, 100 followed after.

31) The king ordered the houses within the fort to be arranged in quarters. Roads were to be marked by piles and if any house protruded beyond the markers it was to be pulled 1 his was Danuredja Il, grandson of the first prince to hold this position peculiar to Jogjakarta. He was 'minister' from 1799 until his murder in 1811. Danuredja II was particularly hated by Sultan Sepuh because the former had assisted Governor-General Daendels to depose him in 1810 and replace him with his son (later Sultan Radja). With the arrival of the English in 1811 Sultan Sepuh regained the

throne and used this opportunity to kill Danuredja II soon after his return to power.

down immediately. Coconut trees too were cut down. The populace were worried by these acts and said among themselves: ‘This is a sign that there will be no prosperity.' (32 j)

33) The king went riding in his carriage. The accompanying soldiers rode on horses. The carriage went quickly, flying like the wind. Many soldiers were killed, being trampled by the following horses pulling the carriage and also by the wheels of the carriage. The king knew soldiers were being killed and trampled by the horses of his carriage, yet each day he went driving and each day soldiers fell from their horses and were killed by the speeding carriage.

37) The king never thought of good works, he only followed his own desires. The only thing he observed. was his father's order to honour his elder brother. This he did not neglect.

38) At the same time Dipanegara was doing penance, unceasingly performing the Odjrat meditation. He was trying to protect the good name of the king and prayed that he | would return to being a good king. Every day Dipanegara performed the luha prayer, next he read the Kur'an, -AIl:these things he did every day, at Sélaradja. He performed the Odjrat rites on a stone, and there he also read the Kur'an, When finished with the Kurtanhe would then take up

the 'Fatah-ul-Muluk' .! This work contained stories of good

 

1 . ie, 'The Victory of Kings' an Arabic work presumably relating the lives of good and bad kings of the Muslim world. 

269

kings of the past. Reading this work Dipanegara was reminded of the evil deeds of his younger brother. He therefore sent a letter to his younger brother calling on him to visit him to receive instruction.

46) The king left immediately for Sélaradja with only forty servants, and wearing ragged clothes.

47) On his arrival, the king was greeted by Dipanegara and they both sat down on the stone. Dipanegara then told two stories from the 'Fatah-ul-Muluk' in order to instruct the king, his younger brother, in the proper actions of rulers:

48) 'There once was a mighty king whose kingdom was very great and who lived in a large palace. He was only interested in pleasure and he ignored his Lord, the Prophet of God. He dressed in beautiful clothes, he ate and drank well, he danced with palace girls and he had the gamelan orchestra to please his heart. Though he neglected religion, he conquered many countries, 51) One day the king saw a magnificent horse. He ordered his attendants to hold it while he mounted. Then he rode it around the palace. Suddenly it reared up and tossed the king from its back.

The king fell on a stone and was killed,

52) In Adjam (Syria) there was a king who enjoyed himself every day, pursuing his desires. He called together all his regents and nobles for a great party and as they drank and ate, there came a great wind. It was dark within

the city, and the palace trembled and shook. Finally the

 

 

270

palace was destroyed and it was carried away by a whirlwind, The king and all his nobles were killed,'!

54) Finishing his stories, Dipanegara implored his younger brother to remember the lesson of the two stories. As for the king, he felt that he had been chided by his brother, He asked leave to return home and when he had come to the palace he felt despondent.

55) The king however did not change, and his desires

did not decrease. At Tegalredja Dipanegara ordered all his servants to pray and whoever did not perform their religious duties was

to be sent away, whether he be young or old.

CANTO III

1) Prince Dipanegara unceasingly performed the Odjrat penance in the cave at Silarong. The cave had been improved and decorated so that it was a suitable place for

meditation. The prince also performed ascetic acts at

3 .

7 2 Pemantjingan, Parang Wedang and Parang Kusuma.

l, 2, 3

These are all districts and villages in the southern regions of Jogjakarta. Parang Wédang is presumably a hot spring and Parang Kusuma could be the name given to a place where there was a rock shaped like a flower. As verse 2 states, the prince went often to the southern districts bordering the Southern Ocean. This area has been and remains important for the royal house of Mataram and Jogja. According to tradition the protectress of the Mataram dynasty, Njai Rara Kidul, resides in the Southern Ocean. The Babad Tanah Djawi (W.L. Olthof, Jav. version, p.80) records how S€napati, founder of the dynasty, did penance on the shores of the Southern Ocean and obtained the protection of Njai Rara Kidul for his descendants. Dipanegara, as a descendant of Sénapati and an aspirant to regal power, was therefore following a well established tradition by making pilgrimages to this region. 

271

2) He also visited the Suléman cave,! taking with him two servants. He made pilgrimages to the Southern Ocean, and the gunung Kidul, the Sura Lanang cave and the Sarungga Mountain.

3) On his pilgrimages the prince wore only a dark skirt; the red jacket of kings and the back of the skirt was raised, He fasted, eating only once every one or two months. 4) Dipanegara performed these severe penances because he believed that if one did good works during one's life then one would achieve eternal pleasure in heaven.

If one failed to carry out all the prescriptions of the prophet, then one would remain eternally in hell.

9) The prince once travelled westwards, and crossing the Praga river he made for the Upas cave. He was accompanied by Djajamustapa. Reaching the cave the two entered, crawling on their hands and knees for the entrance was very narrow. They soon reached an open part of the cave and from the roof there dripped ice-cold water. Dipanegara then gave thanks for all God's mercies and in particular for the Creation: ‘He was moved in his heart receiving from God all that moved and all that was still these were certainly the works of God.' (13 f-i).

1

The Suleman cave may have been a cave near Sleman, north of Jogjakarta. Alternatively the translation 'cave of Solomon' may have been the meaning intended.

2 : .

The districts mentioned in this verse would also seem to be Situated to the south of Jogja (see Notes 1,2 and 3 on p.270). The gunung Kidul, 'Southern Mountains', "is the mountain range south of Jogja which runs along the Indian Ocean coast. Today gunung Kidul is the name of a kabupaten in the region, with its capital at Wonosari. 

272

14) His one servant (Djajamustapa) was ordered to read and learn by heart the Ja Sin surah. Seven days and seven nights he remained in the cave praying and asking God for forgiveness.

15) Suddenly there was a rockfall in the cave. There was a ghost whose roaring thundered in the cave. Stones fell like rain. Because of the beating of his heart, Dipanegara forgot God,

17) Djajamustapa and Dipanegara went out of the cave. Dipanegara was upset because he felt that the rockfall had been a test of Satan and by forgetting God he had been found wanting in faith.

21) Djajamustapa reassured him by pointing out that it was not in fact a test of Satan, that the cave was not an ordinary cave, and that the ghost in it was not an ordinary ghost. He asserted that it had been nothing other than a sign from God that his penance had been accepted and that his former sins were forgiven.

23-4) Dipanegara was still disturbed by the incident and still felt shame for having forgotten God.

25) Djajamustapa therefore related a story to prove his

point:

1

One of the surahs of the Kur'an (see Kurtan, p.170). This surah is held to be particularly sacred as it mentions the

creation: ‘When He creates a thing He need only say: "Be" and it is.' The Upas cave, perhaps because of its grandeur

and mystery (the chill water) obviously moved Dipanegara to wonder at the Creation and the Ya Sin surah accords with his musings in verse 13.

 

273

'The king of Sabur was most religious and he did not deviate from the sjariah.! He listened to all the holy men. He practised nasoka (devotions).?

There came a great disturbance: the world was shaken, the rocks of the mountains fell down, the wind and the rain were swirled around.

This was the sign that the king's sins had been forgiven.'? Dipane gara was relieved and both returned to Tegalredja.

29) Sultan Djarot one day went riding in his carriage; when tired of that, he went inside the palace and relaxed with the young maidens. The gamelan orchestra soothed his

heart.

35) The king asked for food and food was brought from outside the palace, from prince Mangkubumi.

36) As he was eating a fish, he became sick, The fish was still in his mouth when he fell down and died.”

38) When the Resident? came to see the body he desired

to have the dead king's thigh cut open. Dipanegara

‘Muslim law.

*Like Ojrat, a form of mystic devotion and meditation. Tt is derived from the Arabic nuska 'devotion'. See J.G. Hara S.J. '‘Arabic-English Dictionary', Catholic Press, Beirut,

p.767314 is interesting to note that a natural disaster could confirm a King's virtue. Normally tradition held that such occurrences were a sign of impending doom because of the evil of the reigning king.

‘Uncle of the king. °16 December 1822, A.D.

rhe ‘Resident! was acting Resident Baron de Salis who

replaced van Nahuys only little more than a month before Djarot's death. He is referred to by Tjakranegara as the 'Residen bongos' - the 'fat' Resident. | 

274

objected. However the Resident insisted saying that the

poison in his body would be able to flow out and the king

would live again. The Queen Mother agreed and the king's thigh was cut, but no blood came out.

43) The king's body was washed and placed in the coffin. All the religious teachers and scholars gathered to pray. 44) They chanted the Usali prayer. The coffin was decorated, and under an escort of guards it was taken to the royal graveyard.

47-8) News of the king's death was taken to Batavia.” The Rateni® met together to discuss it. 50) They decided that the son of the dead king should succeed to the throne

and that Dipanegara should act as his wakil (guardian).

1 According to Islamic belief, the dead king would carry the wound of the cut forever in the afterlife. With the resurrection of the body in heaven, thé body should be whole. As Dipanegara himself says to the Resident:

If he came to life,

I would be very happy,

if he is cut, but does not live again

then he is dead and he also bears wounds. (41, c-f) 2 In the following verses Tjakranegara describes drawn out | plotting and delays in the coronation of Menol, which like this consultation with the Raad van Indie in Batavia just could not have happened or at least have been long and drawn out. The fact is that Menol was installed on 19 December 1822, three days after his father's death on the 16th. This completely discounts a road trip to Semarang and a boat trip from there to Batavia - and back! Delays there may have been, and there was most probably plotting amongst the Queen Mother - Danuredja clique, but it must be seen as telescoped into three days and not as occurring over a period of time as Tjakranegara seems to suggest. 3 A Javanese corruption of Raad van Indie, the Council of the Indies, This body advised the Governor-General on matters of policy.

 

275 55-7) The advice of the Rateni was transmitted to Jogjakarta. Dipanegara agreed that his nephew should be king: 1 As for my son he should be king. (56 a-b) However he refused to act as guardian claiming that he wanted to become a santri and a holy man. He asked that 2 | ; prince Mangkubumi be the only guardian. The Resident could not agree to this, because he was afraid to change the Governor-General's orders. Dipanegara then asked that the Resident request permission: from Batavia and that while a reply was awaited, the coronation of the king be postponed. The assembled nobles then departed. ~ 59-64) The Queen Mother, the wife of Sultan Radja.’ and grandmother of the young king, became concerned, She feared that Prince Dipanegara intended to make himself king, instead of her grandson: If my grandson doesnot succeed in becoming king the vacant kingship

will be filled by prince Dipanegara and he is the son of a lesser wife.

(60 a-n)

The Resident was summoned into the palace and asked to

3

explain why her grandson had not been made king. She stated

that if Dipanegara's wishes were followed there would be no

peace.

1

In fact, his nephew. 2

Uncleof Dipanegara. 3

The word used for describing Dipanegara's mother, one of the Queen Mother's fellow 'wives!', is selir, which can range in meaning from lesser wife to mistress. 

276

65) Still no letter came from Batavia. The Resident began to go to the palace quite often. He visited there at nights. He loved the Queen Mother very much and he followed all her wishes.

66) The Queen Mother plotted with Danuredja and Wiranegara. She urged the Resident:

Let us not await | the letter from Batavia, 7 (68 b-c)

Danuredja supported her:

It would be best if the wishes of the Queen Mother were followed.

(68 e-f)

69) Danuredja did this because he thought that it would bring about a dispute between Dipanegara and the Dutch. Danuredja had a personal dislike for Dipanegara. Other princes respected Danuredja and they came to his house. Only Dipanegara did not come to visit him. Danuredja also disliked Dipanegara because he had become a minister through the good offices of Dipanegara.

70-1) The people of Jogjakarta awaited the arrival of

the letter from Batavia.

1

Danuredja had been elevated to that position in June 1812 at the same time as Sultan Sepuh.was replaced by his son Sultan Radja. This was effected by Raffles: and his English troops but Crawford, the English Resident, does record that Dipanegara negotiated with him to have his father ‘put on _ the throne. We have seen in Cantos I and II that the Crown Princeship had been ‘promised! to Dipanegara, presumably because of his assistance to his father and the English in 1812, It may well be that, as Tjakranegara states here, Dipanegara also manoeuvred with the English to have Danuredja appointed, (This claim is repeated in Canto IV, verse 75).

CANTO IV

1-3) The prince returning from the capital had left his Tegalredja residence the same afternoon and travelled to the Silarong cave to meditate and pray. He took two attendants with him.

4) He had been there three days! when in the morning he heard the sound of cannon, perhaps announcing the arrival of the letter, He returned home immediately.

6) There his servant, Kertadjaja, informed him that he had heard at the house of Sindudjaja that the young prince had been installed as king. 7) Dipanegara had been ignored, and he knew that this was the work of Danuredja, Wiranegara and the Queen Mother. 8) Upset and ashamed, Dipanegara locked himself in his residence at Sélaradja for three days and nights. He asked himself why he was not called to the coronation:

I have no intention of seizing the throne. and yet I am suspected of bad things. (9 e-f) He realized that he was powerless to redress this affront: If Ido not acquiesce to this then certainly the state will be destroyed. (11 a-b)

 

1

Above the question was raisedof the author's credibility with respect to the time which he seems to imply elapsed between the death of Djarot and the accession of Menol. It was in fact only three days, but Tjakranegara spoke of consultations with Batavia, and delays and plots. Here however he states correctly that there was only a gap of three days from the time Dipanegara left Jogja and the installation of Menol.

 

278

12) Dipanegara called his advisers and the pangulu" of Jogja, Amad Bahwi, to discuss this matter. Dipanegara was seated on the Séla Gilang” and he ordered Sastrawinangun, a servant, to read the Ardjunawidjaja, starting from the story of misery and penance.

14-9) Dipanegara then explained to the pangulu how he had been set aside due to the machinations of Danuredja, Wiranegara and the Queen Mother, and had not been called to the coronation of his nephew. He continued: |

This has been done so as to anger me, and yet if I acted on my anger, | then the country of Jogja would certainly be

disturbed. (19 d-f)

20) The pangulu counselled moderation. He called this incident a test of God. If the prince intended to react violently, then his mind would become impure and union with God and the mystical knowledge of the Godhead would become impossible. To seize the throne now while the heart was full of revenge and impure thoughts would only result in failure. The prince accepted this.

25) A letter arrived from the Residency and

Dipanegara replied to it.

1 The head of the Islamic religion. 2 The stone on which he meditated. 3

An appropriate piece of Javanese literature, under the circumstances.

This letter presumably informed him of the installation of Menol as Sultan. |

 

279

26) After some time! the Residen bongos (de Salis) was

replaced, because the rumours of his actions had spread. He had not been good in the position, and he only sought his own pleasure. He was replaced by Semitsar (Smissaert). The kingdom then began to prosper and Dipanegara and Smissaert made a friendly accord.

| 32) Dipanegara spent his time involved in religious practices. At night he would read three chapters of the Kur'an. In the morning he gathered about him all his retainers and they all read in turn. After reading another three chapters they would stop to eat. They would also read out various kinds of books on theology, mysticism, union with the Godhead etc. They read the Tuhfah> books on worship and the work 'Hakik-ul-Modin'3 After a month they would change and start to sing the

Suluks." They would change again and read the 'Serat

lomi ssaert replaced Baron de Salis on 10 February 1823, two months after the accession of Menol.

2 . The Tuhfah is a Sjafi'i law book. See I. de Vries,

'Kitab Toehpah', Verhandelingen KGB vol.68, 4th part, Batavia 1929; and T. Roordra,'Kitab Toehpah, een Javaansch Handboek voor het Mohammedaansche Regt', 2nd edition, Leiden 1874. Roordra's work provides the text in Javanese characters; de Vries has a Dutch translation and he compares the Javanese Tuhfah with its Arabic source the 'Tuhfat al Muhtadj 1i sjarkh al Minhadj' of Ibn Hajar (1504-67) . ;

3Like the Fatah-ul-Muluk, both the Hakik-ul-Modin and

Niskat-ul-Muluk are didactic and edifying works. See Pigeaud, 'Literature of Java', vol.II, pp.94-101.

Anbija' (The Lives of the Prophets‘).

26) When finished the 'Serat Ambija't, they then read the Niskat-ul-—Muluk, which told of the good and bad kings of yore in the lands of Arabia and Syria.

37) After another month they changed again, and they recited the Ardunawidjaja,” the Serat Rama? up until the time of Rama's arrival in Ayodhya, the Ardunawiwaha and

the Bomantaka.?

38) After yet another month they would change and read the commentaries on the Kurtan. Then they read the Kur'tan again.

39) When tired of the readings the prince went to do

penance on the southern coast. He went to Pemantjingan,

 

TAnbiya (the text shows the corrupted form Ambija) is the Arabic plural of the work nabi, 'prophet!. Muhammad was the Seal of the Prophets, and before him there were many prophets, to whom God had revealed only part of his word. Nabi Isa (Jesus), nabi Ibrahim (Abraham) nabi Adam (Adam) and other Old Testament figures reappear in the Kur'an and Islamic religious literature. Stories of their lives and trials made good reading, it seems, for the pious. See Pigeaud, ‘Literature of Java‘, vol.I, pp.129-33.

“The Ardjuna Wiwaha was studied assiduously by Javanese authors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as well as by modern European scholars.

the Gunung Kidul area, Balimbing, Sampar, Wulusan and Giri Mountain." He visited caves far from his residence, taking

with him only three servants.

41) At Sélaradja Dipanegara continued his penance. Only on Thursdays did he go to his harem to be with his wives. One wife complained of his infrequent visits: What should be the result,

day and night I think of you, but,my heart is. frozen, because we seldom receive "gifts" from you, my lord.

(42 def)

She continued:

If he comes to my bed, then during the night we do not move at all.

(45 ab)

16-50) Dipanegara rarely attended audiences in the capital. Occasionally he met Danuredja, the Resident, the Queen Mother, and the young king, who at this time was four years old.” Dipanegara was very fond of the young king and acted as his father. Menol was often brought to Tegalredja

to see his uncle,

50-4) One day Danuredja and Wiranegara were talking

with Resident Smissaert, Danuredja' was plotting to “arouse

Dipanegara!s. feelings and so-he proposed.that’.a new.road be

Is this Imagiri, where the burial place of the Mataram kings was situatéd? In his wanderings Dipanegara did visit the burial places of his ancestors to divine their intentions or seek their approval for his ambitions. 5

This mention of Menolts age enables us to date surrounding events circa early 1824 (Menol was born 25 January 1820). Thus just over a year had passed since Dipanegara had been angered by his non attendance at his nephew's coronation. 

282

built, connecting the mountaineous areas of the south with the Great North Road," but bypassing the city of Jogja. The road would pass through Silarong and Tompe jan (the lands of Dipanegara).

55) The Resident agreed to this proposal, provided Dipanegara also agreed.

58-9) Danuredja and Wiranegara returned home to build this road, which would run through the pleasure garden of Dipanegara at Tompé jan.

64) The messenger of the patih Danuredja soon arrived in Tompé jan and his name. was Bratakusuma. His work -—gang placed stakes on Dipanegara's ground. Dipanegara was at that moment resting in his pleasure garden and asked his gardener who was putting in the stakes. He replied that it was Bratakusuma, envoy of the patih.

64-7) Dipanegara was extremely angry and he ordered his gardener to go andpull out the stakes and if they resisted he was to hit Bratakusuma on the head. This he did, and Bratakusuma and his supporters ran to the house of the patih to inform him,

67-8) Danuredja went immediately to the Lodji (Residency) to inform the Resident of Dipanegara's treasonable defiance. Smissaert rebuked him, saying that he had given permission for the road only if Dipanegara agreed to it. Bratakusuma had put down stakes without first

asking permission and he deserved to be hit on the head. Danuredja became even more hateful as a result of this rebuttal.

70) Later Dipanegara came to the palace because the Queen Mother had become very sick. Here he met the patih, whom he called to his presence. Dipanegara and the patih Danuredja spoke for a long time, and Dipanegara rebuked him for agreeing to the cession of the Redjawinangun sawahs to the Dutch." Dipanegara stated that the lands were not his to give and he should not seek to perform favours for the Dutch, using that which was not his.

72) Dipanegara could be so frank with the patih because he had caused him to be made Danuredja in the first place. Danuredja had forgotten his beginnings.”

73) Danuredja answered the charges frivolously, and Dipanegara hit him on the cheek with his slipper.

74) Danuredja was incensed by this and went home

humiliated. He asked himself:

 

L

These rice fields may well be the Djabarangkah and Karangkobar lands which the Dutch acquired from Jogja and Solo on 1 January 1825. Dutch writers have seen their cession to the Dutch as one of the causes of the war, but it is obvious here that the question of the loss of these sawahs is secondary to the bitter personality conflict. For a discussion of the cession of the Karangkobar and Djabarangkah Jands see P.H. van der Kemp, 'De Economische Orrzaken!, BKI volgreeks IIIe deel 1897 (vo1.47), pp.1-48; in particular = section III, 'De Ontneming der Landen Karangkobar en Djabarangkah!, 2

His appointment as Patih (Minister) was due to Dipanegara. 

284

Who dares to depose me? if I am on gocd terms with the Dutch who dares to stand up to me?

(74 e-g) 75-7) As a result of his humiliation, Danuredja drew closer to the Dutch. 79-80) The pangulu' Rahmanudin wds replaced, and his post was taken by Kamalodinningrat who was appointed by Danuredja, the Queen Mother and the Resident. Dipanegara

was not consulted.

CANTO V

1) Dipanegara felt that the appointment of a new pangulu was the work of Danuredja and the Queen Mother, in collusion with the Dutch. He argued that only the king could appoint a new pangulu, not Danuredja. But was the young king himself capable of appointing a pangulu? Dipanegara remembered one of the articles in the Tuhfah:*

If there is a king,

who has not yet attained his majority, but reigns as

king, his exercise of power is not legal.

(9 a-c)

10) Further, if a young king could not legally exercise power, then he could not implement laws, nor could he appoint a pangulu.

11) Dipanegara called together the Muslim legal

scholars and asked whether this rule applied to the reign

 

Le Head of the Islamic religion,

2 Sjafi'i book on Fikh (Islamic law). In Canto IV Dipanegara is described as calling on his retainers to read to him from this work. See Summary, Canto IV, verse 32. 285

of his nephew. They agreed that it did.

12-7) Dipanegara wrote to the Queen Mother, saying that the appointment of the panguilu was not legal and explained his reasons for saying so. The Queen Mother replied that he should not try to cause trouble over what was already settled. Dipanegara acquiesced in this.

18) Soon the Pinggir people ceased to marry." Those who had children could not marry them for no one could appoint a wali. The pangulu could not marry the Pinggir people, only the king could marry them, but he had not yet attained his majority. As there was consequently much

confusion in the kingdom, the pangulu consulted the legal

scholars. 21) The scholars replied that only Dipanegara had the power to appoint a. judge as wali to marry the Pinggir

people.

1

The Pinggir people were originally people from Balambangan and Pati who, being captured in war, were brought to Jogja and made slaves of the king. Their name (pinggir means edge, rim) may be derived from their residing in the outer sections of the city. As slaves of the king, they could only marry with his permission and through his good offices. Islamic law holds that no one can marry without the intervention of a wali i.e. a go-between, usually appointed by the girl's father. In the case of the Pinggirs, the wali had to be appointed by the king, who functioned as their tfather!. Thus the Pinggir people could not be married, because by law Menol was not able to exercise the royal powers. Even the pangulu could not take it upon himself to marry the wards of the king. This embarrassing position was only relieved by recognizing that Dipanegara exercised royal power (until, we presume, his nephew had reached adulthood). This situation also called into the question the legality of the penguluts appointment. In this matter too Dipanegara exercised the royal power that was implicitly recognized in respect of the marrying of the Pinggir people. 

 

286

22-30) The opinion of the scholars was conveyed to the Gueen Mother and Danuredja. The Queen Mother ordered Danuredja to inform Kamalodinningrat, the new pangulu, that he should go to Dipanegara and seek approval of his appointment as pangulu. He should also ask that Dipanegara give him the power to appoint a wali to marry the Pinggir people. Kamalodin agreed and departed for Tegalredja with his retinue.

34) The pangulu arrived at Tegalredja and came into the presence of Dipanegara who was seated on the S£la Gilang.

36) The pangulu then asked Dipanegara most politely for his approval that he become pangulu of 'Mataram!, and | that he also be allowed to marry the Pinggir people, using a judge as wali. He added: |

It is only you my Lord Prince,

who has the sole right to power in Mataram; it is so written in the Scriptures.

(39 anc)

39-10) The prince smiled, remembering the letter of the Queen Mother. He was not mistaken and the Queen Mother had been proved wrong. She should not have refused to heed his letter.

41) In spite of the offence given him by the Queen Mother's letter he determined to approve the pangulu's request. To do otherwise would prejudice the safety of the kingdom. |

42) The prince therefore gave permission for Kamalodin

to become pangulu of 'Mataram Jogjakarta Adiningrat'. 

287

45) Kamalodin returned to the capital and informed Danuredja that his appointment was now legal, ‘according to the Scriptures!. Danuredja hearing this only smiled and said nothing. .

16-8) Dipanegara continued to pray and meditate. He distributed money to holymen and the poor.

19-52) Dipanegara became disturbed in his heart, seeing how Danuredja, the Queen Mother and Wiranegara plotted and cooperated with the Dutch. Even the young king was keen to have the affection of Resident Smissaert, Things became bad in the kingdom. All the people deviated from the rules of Islam. No one thought of religion any longer. This was all

due to Danuredja and Wiranegara. Dipanegara felt regret in

his hearts

CANTO VI

1) The relationship between Dipanegara on the one hand and Danuredja, the Queen Mother and the Dutch on the other continued to deteriorate. Dipanegara was suspected of attempting to set up his own power base in Silarong. Danuredja, still mindful of the occasion when Dipanegara had struck him on the cheek with a slipper, aroused suspicion of Dipanegara by spreading false rumours of mobilization at Silarong. The Queen Mother was easily persuaded.

7) He told her that he had a spy in Dipanegara's

service who had informed him that the prince intended to 288

leave the capital and establish himself as a kraman” at Silarong. The Queen Mother was horrified and ordered Danuredja to inform the Resident Smissaert of Dipanegara's plans. 25) The Resident heard him in silence,

26) Dipanegara also was disturbed. 27) He was beginning to realise that his enemies were preparing to remove him with the assistance of the Dutch. He feared that the Dutch might seize the kingdom of Jogjakarta,

28) Concerned for the future of Java, Dipanegara decided to seek advice in the form of signs from various traditional sources.

He ordered his servant, Djajamustapa, to go to the burial place of Sultan Agung at Imagiri, there to meditate and do penance in the hope of receiving some oracle or hint as to the future. Djajamustapa went to Imagiri and spent a night in prayer, asking that God send a sign. 32) The following morning Djajaniustapa and. the attendant Ki Balad entered the precincts of the sarcophagus and were surprised to see a red spot in the centre of the curtain which surrounded the tomb. 38-9) Ki Balad explained that the appearance of this spot with the colour of blood was a bad sign, as it meant that much blood would soon be spilt in Java.

40) Djajamustapa returned to Dipanegara and informed him of the sign he had seen. Dipanegara admitted that a 1

289

great war was to come to Java and much blood would be spilt, put he recognized that this was the will of God and he as a creature of God could only carry out the wishes of the Almighty. He knew that if God had decided that he should be the cause of that war, then no number of holy men could alter this fact.

hl) Dipanegara now sent Djajamustapa on a much more extensive mission. He was to go to the island of Brambang (present-day Nusakambangan, opposite the port of Tjilatjap) and the Mesjid-Watu (Stone Mosque). He was to try to obtain the Djajakusuma flower (Victory Flower). If he could not find it then he was to return northwards from the southern shores and undertake a pilgrimage to a number of centres, all the time searching for signs. Some of the places he was asked to visit included Gumelem, Segara Windu, Tjahjana, Mt Lawet and Pekiringan. Djajamustapa was given the assistance of Djanodin and Kjai Mopid. 50) The next day the party left Sélaradja and headed southwards to Telatjap (Tjilatjap), stopping here and there. While crossing the Seraju river, they saw a very large crocodile and were very frightened. Arriving on the other side of the river, they continued their journey along the shores of the Southern Ocean. 61) There were seven deer from the island of Brambang gambolling on the waves. 62) They soon arrived in Tjilatjap. 66) With thepriest of the village, Kjai

Resajuda, they discussed the cost of travelling to where 

290

the Djajakusuma flower grows. Kjai Resajuda said that to go by boat to the island would cost 100 ringgits.” This

the party could not afford and in this way Dipanegara was robbed of his chance to acquire the Djajakusuma flower. However the cost of travelling to the Mesdjid Sela was only two rials and so the party decided to carry out Dipanegara's secondary orders and undertake a pilerimage to various holy

places. 71) The next moming they set out by boat for the

Mesdjid Séla.

CANTO VII

1) Kjai Djajamustapa and his companions arrived at the Mesdjid Séla. Here they prayed the whole night, beseeching God to bring blessings on the kingdom of Mataram and asking that their lord, Dipanegara, might prosper. 10) While asleep Ki Djanodin received a sign. He saw Dipanegara riding the buffalo called sapi Gumarang, The buffalo was as tall as a mountain, and its feet were entwined in the roots of a 'Balaran! tree, The buffalo broke free and bore the prince away on its back.

14) Two days later the party returned to Tjilatjap. They then made for Pasir, crossing the Bengawan river on the 1 It is called either Nini-nini Island, Madjeti Island or Brambang Island. The Mesdjid Sela must be situated on some rocky outcrop near Tjilatjap and not necessarily on the island of Nusakambangan where the flower grows, judging by

291

way. After two days travel they arrived in Pasir and spent seven days and seven nights at a burial place, praying and meditating. Thereafter they journeyed towards the Segara Windu, stopping at several places on the way. 22) Arriving at the Segara Windu, a great storm descended on the party during the night. 25) The following morning they continued their pilgrimage, stopping at Gumelem and Pekiringan.

26) They hext spent a night at the burial place of the wali Prakosa. 27) The party saw a sign here. The curtain surrounding the sarcophagus was torn away and blown off by the wind, while many trees were uprooted. This was interpreted as prophesying the destruction of Jogjakarta and reinforced the concern felt by Djajamustapa and Ki Mopid after having seen Dipanegara mounted on the sapi Gumarang.

31) The next day they proceeded to Mt Lawet, but spent the night on the road. Next day they climbed the mountain and prayed at the burial place of a holy man buried there. Here another sign was revealed to them. Again the curtain surrounding the grave disappeared and a ravine opened and a part of the mountain fell into the ravine. This sign from

God was as ominous as those previously revealed.

CANTO VIIT 1) The group descended from the mountain and discussed the signs that had been received. It was agreed that if it was Godts will that the world be destroyed, then it must be

SO 292

3) They next journeyed to Mt Merbabu and Ngargadalem, They went very close to the edge of the volcano and Djajamustapa was overcome by the fumes. His friends then had to carry him down, Thick clouds and a storm surrounded them as they descended. The storm abated at evening and they were able to continue their journey.

8) They next climbed Mt Merapi and spent two nights by

the crater of the volcano.

9) At this stage they had been away for 50 days and they began their journey home to Tegalredja. When close to home they were overtaken by nightfall and they passed the night in the mosque at Kuwaron. In a dream Ki Gedé in Séla came to Ki Mopid and advised him:

Dipanegara in the future

will certainly have decision over life and death

he will spread the religion of the sjariah

and he will be assisted by God al-—Sabur

and to him will be given the grace of God

but there will be difficulties later on

knowing the future there are risks

by avoiding four things

recklessness, pride, conceit,

he will certainly succeed in his efforts.

If not,

if he falls prey to those four things,

the blessings and the guidance of God will disappear and so also the light of God

and there will be robbery

if he is not aware of this, he will fail to become king.. Beware lest the friends of the king are bad.

(10d-11j) 12) At noon the next day they reached Tegalredja and immediately reported to Dipanegara. They informed him that

they had been unable to obtain the Djajakusuma flower and

 

1 In fact, only three are mentioned. 

293 |

they also told of the signs they mad seen. Dipanegara accepted the message of the signs: If such is the case

if those are the signs which have come if Mataram

is to be devastated in the future because of me then it is the will of God.

(15 g-k)

16) The travellers then dispersed and left Dipanegara alone to think over the meaning of the signs. He was disturbed and depressed that he should be the cause of the destruction of Mataram, How could he carry out his desire to stop Dutch interference and to spread the Islamic religion in Java as its head?

17) <As he dwelt on these things and prayed to God, there came a voice which whispered:

It is already approved by God

that you should become king

as for recklessness, ,if you fall prey to it you will not succeed.

(20 b-j)

21) Dipanegara immediately called Djajamustapa and asked whether the voice was the voice of the devil or of an angel. Djajamustapa answered that since his master had been praying when the voice was heard, it could only be the voice of an angel. Dipanegara then dismissed Djajamustapa and fell asleep on the stone called the sêla Gegilang.

- 23) At this time Dipanegara was being spied upon by the Dutch. Danuredja had already spoken to Resident Smissaert (of Dipanegarats treasonable tendencies). Smissaert had not believed him then, but Smissaert was to

see with his own eyes and he was no longer to be in doubt.

 

 

294

26) Dipanegara was invited to a party at the Residency, but he was asked not to bring many retainers. Dipanegara was wary, thinking it a Dutch ruse to arrest him. So when he went to the Residency he took many retainers with him and he remained with them outside the Residency.

27) Dipanegara was again invited to a party, this time at the country home of the Resident at Bedaja. Dipanegara was again wary of the Dutch intentions, and brought 100 soldiers with him. Again Dipanegara remained outside. When invited inside, he refused.

30) As a result of these incidents Dipanegara began to give more credence to the rumours that the Resident, in league with Danuredja and also the prince Mangkualam (Paku Alam), intended to attack Tegalredja and arrest him. Dipanegara's thoughts turned to a Holy War:

it is the predestination of God Almighty

that I should begin a Holy War

what kind of death

does a man seek

other than an honourable death.

(31 d-h)

Dipanegara therefore ordered that all the people of Tegalredja should stand guard at night with their weapons. People from other villages came to Tegalredja at night to guard Dipanegara. 33) These people numbered about 300. More and more people came as word of Dipanegara's call for assistance spread through the state.

The people assembled at Tegalredja took on the appearance of an army. 34) The order went out to the village people to be on the alert, for !Dutch soldiers had

already been seen’. 

295

35) The activities at Tegalredja also gave rise to

wild rumours: The rumours increased: (they say) that the prince will certainly rebel and attack the capital. The rumours were exaggerated and were known throughout the kingdom: (they say) the prince in the month of Sura will depart from the capital and will declare Himself king at Silarong.

(verse 35) 36) The prince was disturbed at the rumours that stated that he intended to make himself king. However he did

nothing, accepting the situation as an expression of God's

CANTO IX

1) Dipanegara called together his elderly retainers and asked them for their advice as to what he should do about the rumours that were widespread concerning his intention to rebel and make himself king. They replied that Tegalredja was certain to be attacked and that preparations should be made to meet the attack. They pointed out that the Dutch through their spies were already aware of the presence of large numbers of people at Tegalredja.

6) Dipanegara, realising that the Dutch would oppose him regardless of anything he might do, decided to send a letter to all the village people who supported him. The letter called on the villagers to assemble in support of Dipanegara, Senior people were appointed commanders. With this army Dipanegara now intended to start a Holy War and

establish Islam in Java. 296

9) In response to this call, many people flocked to Tegalredja. They came from the capital and the villages. They included soldiers from the royal army. Dipanegarats supporters awaited the seventh day of the month of Sura (August 1825): | 7 They all knew exactly the day

that they should be ready in the month of Sura.

(12 d-g)

15) The Resident Smissaert was also aware of the warlike preparations at Tegalredja. He was kept informed by the spies of Danuredja who mixed with the people. at Tegalredja. Smissaert called a meeting of Dutch officials and loyal princes. Smissaert said that it would be better if the Dutch could nip the rebellion in the bud. If they were to wait, many more people would die. The Queen Mother sent word to Smissaert that an early attack should be made on Tegalredja while the number of supporters was still small.

19) Smissaert however procrastinated. He then sent a bupati, Kjai Sindunegara, to Dipanegara calling on him to come to the Residency.

21) If Dipanegara refused to come, Sindunegara was to ask him why so many people had assembled at Tegalredja.

22) Sindunegara arrived at Tegalredja and invited

Dipanegara to come to. the Residency. Dipanegara in turn

 

1

Western sources record that the procrastination Tjakranegara speaks of, was due to the fact that Smissaert had been holidaying at Bedaja for some time and he returned to Jogja only on 18 July. His return was made necessary by the outbreak of disturbances in the Bedaja area, perhaps resulting from Dipanegara's call to arms. It was on 18 July that Smissaert sent Sindunegara on his first mission to Tegalredja. 

297

asked the advice of his supporters who told him not to go, for even though there were many relatives of Dipanegara in the capital it was doubtful whether they would sacrifice themselves to rescue Dipanegara from the Dutch. When told that Dipanegara did not intend going to the Residency, Sindunegara asked why so many people had assembled at Tegalredja. Dipanegara replied:

The reason for many people coming here

is that they love me

all of them,

Therefore they come to guard me T am threatened by robbers and thieves.

(29e - 30b)

Sindunegara asked who would dare threaten the prince, and Dipanegara replied that it was better to be on one's guard.

31) Sindunegara then returned to Jogja and informed Resident Smissaert of the failure of his mission. Smissaert was most angered by Dipanegara!s reply to his invitation:

The Resident was extremely angry

he stamped his foot, and threw his hat down on the table

he said loudly:

Well, Sindunegara

he truly wants to rebel he does dare to oppose the Dutch.

(32 a-f)

33) At this time Dipanegara became concerned that his forces were too unprepared and were unready for a possible early attack. He therefore sent another letter to his supporters calling on them to increase their preparedness.

35) The next day (19 July 1825) military preparations were well advanced in Jogja and the Residency. The Dutch

dragoons were there with cannon, together with the forces of

 

 

298

prince Paku Alam and Danuredja. 36) Sindunegara was sent early in the morning on another mission to Dipanegara. He was to tell the prince that the Resident was prepared to meet him either in the Residency, the palace or even in the home of prince Mangkubumi, Dipanegara's uncle.

41) Dipanegara again refused to meet Smissaert anywhere and he relayed to Sindunegara what he demanded from the Resident:

What I demand is none other than

that Danuredja and Wiranegara be dismissed for the good of Mataram.

(41 dg)

43) Sindunegara then retumed to Jogja, but soon after his departure prince Mangkubumi arrived. He had been sent by Smissaert to arrange a meeting and to act as a surety for Dipanegara.

45) Dipanegara resolutely refused to cooperate and he called on his uncle to join his cause:

Uncle, choose between these two things to die for Islam, or to die with the unbelievers.

(46, cd)

48) Mangkubumi resolved to stay with Dipanegara and support him. Dipanegara then ordered his wife to move to Silarong in the company of Mangkubumi and to take with her supplies and the treasury. 49) That night they left for Silarong with columns of soldiers and groups of non-combatants.

57) The next morning (20 July 1825) Sindunegara was sent yet again to Tegalredja, but in Jogja preparations were already in hand for an attack that day. Danuredja and Wiranegara were confident of success and told the Resident

that Dipanegara was ‘already in their grasp’. 

299

61) Sindunegara however was already at Tegalredja, informing Dipanegara that Wiranegara was in chains at that very moment and that the Resident merely awaited Dipanegara'ts advice as to what was to be done with Wiranegara. Did he want him to be cut into pieces?

63) Dipanegara wavered. He then told Sindunegara that he would go to meet the Resident.

64) But suddenly the sound of cannon was heard.

65) Sindunegara wisely departed, claiming that he would

try to stop the advance of the army. All about was the

sound of cannon and rifles. There was shouting as the people of Tegalredja joined battle with the approaching forces of the Dutch and the Javanese princes. The war had begun.

66) Danuredja and Wiranegara led the opposing forces. Coming from the south they pushed back the defenders of Tegalredja. The battle was fierce, and many were killed. Tegalredja was however overrun,

Dipanegara and Mangkubumi came down to the battlefield to participate personally in the battle while:

The rifles and cannon fired continuously

bullets spread in all directions whistling falling like soft rain.

(75 e-g)

76) In the heat of the battle, Mangkubumi became afraid and he asked Dipanegara to retire from the field for the enemy was too strong.

77) Dipanegara's forces retired to the west, and they crossed the Bajem river. With his comrades, Djajamustapa

fought a rearguard action. Though the Dutch eventually gave 

300

up the chase, Djajamustapa was wounded in the ankle. By dint of great effort, he struggled on towards Silarong where his

master was already rallying his supporters.

Thus began the Java War on 20 July 1825

The translation - only goes as far as Dipanegara's proclamation as Sultan while at Silarong, which took place soon after the outbreak of war. Only three copies of this early volume of the BKI are to be found in Australian libraries: at the Queensland, Melbourne, and Monash University Libraries.

[^3]: The 'Bataviaasch Genootschap voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen', founded to promote the study of the indigenous Indonesian cultures.

[^4]: The record of the Society's vacillating interest in Dipanegara's autobiography is to be found in the 'Notulen Bataviaansch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen', vol.II, p.252, vol.VI, pp.28 and 29 and vol.XV, p.94. The ‘Notulen! are not available in Australia but the most relevant passages are reproduced in Van Praag, ‘Onrust op Java! , pp. 18-23.

[^5]: Javanese for 'verse', 'stanza'.

[^6]: Roorda had published it in 1860, while the debate on the value of Dipanegara's autobiography went on from about 1864 to 1876 when it was finally decided that it was historically valueless. 

[^7]: Van Praag, op.ecit. p.23. The ‘cultures’ mentioned are the cash crops forcibly cultivated by the Javanese peasants.

A microfiche copy of this translation is available in the Australian National University Library (Cat.No.MZ-OS-I). Negatives are available from the Leiden University Library. There may also be copies of Palmer van den Broek's translation in the Museum Pusat in Djakarta: Pigeaud mentions without comment three Babad Dipanegara in Dutch from the collection of the former Batavia Society (BG 246, B15 and 317). See Pigeaud, 'Literature of Java', vol.II, pp.876 and 877. It was the Batavia Society which commissioned the translation and it is very likely that these are copies of the translation finally prepared by Palmer van den Broek.

[^14-11]: LOR 2114 was presumably known to Roorda for it came from his own collection, However, it was naturally of no use to him, as it was a completely different version from the one he translated in 1860. This MS., which is only a fragment of some original work, has attracted little attention from scholars. It is described at some length in Vreede, 'Catalogus', 1892, pp.143-5, and is briefly mentioned in Pigeaud, op. cit., vol,II, Pe 69.

[18-1]: This problem was most obvious when the need arose to prepare notes for a résumé of the history of Mataram from the sixteenth century to 1822 (see Chapter II). In Hall's 'History of Southeast Asia' this period is covered by two chapters whose titles betray their Europe-centrism: Chapter 16 'The Zenith and Decline of the V.O.C.'; and Chapter 25 'Indonesia from the Fall of the V.0.C, to the Recall of Raffles, 1799-1816'. This approach to the history of the period was common to the majority of works consulted. To read this Europe-centric history, one would imagine that the Dutch overwhelmed the Javanese, whose courts and social institutions had consequently ceased to function or be of importance. This is of course nonsense and there are a number of Javanese babads which could demonstrate that Javanese society still functioned quite healthily.

[^18-2]: Resink, in a recapitulation of his views on the relations that obtained between the Netherlands and her East India domains, emphasised that both legally and in practice the Netherlands' power in 'East India' was very much a veneer. Indigenous society in the native states (and these included Jogjakarta and Solo) still flourished under the umbrella of Dutch suzerainty. It is this indigenous society and its history to which we should increasingly turn our attention. See G.J. Resink, 'Indonesia's History Between the Myths,' The Hague, 1968, especially 'The All-but-inverted Image,' pp.327-48. | . \ .

[^18-4]: An important exception to this, is the growing body of post-1945 Indonesian histories of Dipanegara and the war. These are written with a nationalist bias, and refute the Western interpretations. In these works Dipanegara becomes a nationalist, a supporter of ideas suspiciously akin to Pantjasila. (Pantjasila: The Five Principles, the Indonesian State ideology embracing Belief in God; Nationalism; Humanitarianism; Democracy; Social Justice). See Sagimun, 'Pahlawan Dipanegara Berdjuang', Jogjakarta, 1947; J.H, Tarumetor, 'Aku Pangeran Dipanegara', Gunung Agung,Djakarta, 1967; Tamar Djaja, 'Pusaka Indonesia', Djakarta, 1966, Pp.385-107, ‘Pangeran Diponegoro.'

[^19-1]: There has been considerable debate on the usefulness of traditionalist histories to the Western historian whose principal preoccupation is 'fact'. There has been a tendency to wholly reject the babads as fictional and mythical. However studies by scholars such as Professor Berg have demonstrated that there is much valuable material in the babads, and techniques and insights have been suggested to facilitate the sifting of historical facts from the mvth and fiction.
