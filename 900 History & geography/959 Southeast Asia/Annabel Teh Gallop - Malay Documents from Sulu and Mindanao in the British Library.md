## Abstract

The British Library is an important repository for primary source materials on the Philippines in the 18th century, a period when the southern Philippine islands of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago were of great interest to the English East India Company as potential sites for a trading base on the route to China. British involvement in the Philippines in this period culminated in the capture and brief occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764, until its return to Spain at the end of the Seven Years War. The archival materials, largely held in the India Office Records in British Library, are reasonably well-known and studied. But alongside the majority of papers in English and Spanish are a few documents in local languages such as Malay, Maguindanao, and Tausug, written in the modified form of the Arabic script known as Jawi. The contents of some of these documents are known from translations or parallel versions in English, and it is these versions which have been referenced in studies of this period. The original Jawi documents, however, have never been thoroughly examined. This paper focuses on the documents in Malay, with particular attention paid to use of language and formal diplomatic aspects such as annotations, calligraphy, and seals. Final remarks explore the richly multilingual landscape of Sulu and Mindanao, and the relative usage of Malay with respect to Tausug and Maguindanao, as well as foreign languages such as Arabic and Spanish.

## Introduction

The British Library is an important repository of primary source materials on the Philippines in the eighteenth century, a period when the southern Philippine islands of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago were of great interest to the English East India Company as potential sites for a trading base on the route to China. British involvement in the Philippines in this period culminated in the capture and brief occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764, until its return to Spain at the end of the Seven Years War. The archival materials, largely held in the India Office Records in the British Library, are reasonably well-known and studied.<sup>1</sup> But alongside the majority of papers in English and Spanish are a few documents in local languages, such as Malay, Maguindanao, and Tausug, written in the modified form of the Arabic script known as Jawi. These include treaty documents in Malay and Tausug signed with the sultanate of Sulu by Alexander Dalrymple acting for the East India Company in the early 1760s, and two royal Malay letters from Mindanao dated 1775 brought back to Britain by Thomas Forrest, one addressed to King George III and the other to the directors of the East India Company. In some cases, the contents of these documents are known from translations or parallel versions in English, and it is these versions that have been referenced in studies of this period. The original Jawi documents, however, have never been examined, even though a close reading reveals numerous small differences from the English versions, and it is the documents in Malay that will be the focus of this paper.<sup>2</sup>

## The Sulu Treaties 1761 1764

In January 1761, Alexander Dalrymple (1737-1808), a servant of the East India Company, arrived in Jolo, the seat of the sultan of Sulu, charged with the task of negotiating with the sultan to acquire a trading base in the Sulu archipelago. The then ruler of Sulu was Sultan Muhammad Muizzuddin (r. 1748-1763), also known as Bantilan.<sup>3</sup> He was the younger brother of Sultan Azimuddin I (r.1735-1748, 1764-1774), who at the time of Dalrymple's visit was in exile in Manila because of local opposition to his policy of friendship toward Spanish Jesuit missionaries.<sup>4</sup> Following the death of Muizzuddin in 1763 and the brief accession of his son, Sultan Muhammad Azimuddin II (r.1763-1764, 1778-d.1791),<sup>5</sup> Dalrymple was instrumental in helping Sultan Azimuddin I (usually referred to in European-language sources as "Alimuddin") to return From Manila to Sulu and re-accede to the throne in 1764.

Between 1761 and 1764, Dalrymple negotiated and signed four major treaties with successive sultans of Sulu, and most of the original treaty papers have survived in the British Library. All the treaties were bilingual: the first treaty of 1761 was in Malay and English; the second treaty of 1763 was also originally in Malay and English, but only the Spanish translation of the Malay has survived; and the third and fourth treaties of 1764 were in Tausug and English.<sup>6</sup> English versions of these treaties have been published, with a succinct introduction, in A Collection of Treaties and Other Documents Affecting the States of Malaysia 1761-1963, edited by J. de V. Allen, A.J. Stockwell, and L.R. Wright.<sup>7</sup> This article will focus on the first treaty of 1761.

The papers of the first Sulu treaty consist of two documents comprising two bifolia, totaling eight pages (pp. 455-58 and 459-62), now bound into volume 629 of the Home Miscellaneous series of the India Office Records in the British Library. The original treaty, dated 28 January 1761, is written on two facing pages, with the Malay on the left (p. 456) and the English on the right (p. 457), and bears the red ink seals of the sultan and of the East India Company (figure 1). There is an addendum in Malay with English translation on the verso of the Malay treaty (p. 455) clarifying prohibited goods (figure 2); and on the last page (p. 458) is a description of the document in the following words:

Treaty of Friendship & Trade Between the English & Sooloogan nan or Sooloos - Concluded at Soo-oog 28th Jany 1761

[signed] Dalrymple

[diff hand] Ratified by the Dato's & Orankays Sept 1761 [initialed:] D

[diff hand] By Sultan Allamoodin Nov. 20th 1761 -

[diff hand] Recd from Mr Dalrymple 26th October 1768

The second bifolium (pp. 459-62) contains a second copy of the Malay text of the treaty on p. 460, with a different seal of the sultan, and with the names of twenty-four notables of Sulu who ratified it on p. 461 (figure 3); according to the note on p. 458, this document can be dated to September 1761. On the first page, p. 459, is a further ratification by Sultan Muhammad Azimuddin I in Manila dated 20 November 1761 (figure 4). On the last page (p. 462) is annotated: Dato Bandahara & the Other Chief Men Their Ratification of the Treaty Nov 1761. Recd from Mr Dalrymple 26th October 1768. All these documents are reproduced in the appendix, with transliterations of the Malay texts and English translations.

In comparing the English and Malay texts of the treaty, there are a number of differences, some negligible, others not so.<sup>8</sup> or example, clause 5 in the English version, giving the English the right to cultivate plantations, is absent in the Malay, and yet it could be regarded as subsumed in clause 1; of greater import is the presence of the word "perpetual" in the English clause 1, absent in the Malay version. There is an intriguing difference in clause 12: in the English version, for goods salvaged from a shipwrecked vessel in the sultan's dominions, the sultan's share will be two-thirds, but in the Malay version, the sultan receives only one-third, with two-thirds accruing to the owner of the vessel. And yet this is the proportion decreed in such cases in the Malay legal code of the kingdom of Melaka, the Undang-Undang Melaka, which was widely adopted throughout the Muslim courts of Southeast Asia.<sup>9</sup> Particularly intriguing from a linguistic angle is clause 4: the English version mentions "the Chinese," but in the Malay version this community is referred to as orang membuat kain (the makers of cloth), despite the term Cina being a long-established Malay word for "Chinese," which is used in the Maguindanao letters below. A possible explanation is found in Thomas Forrest's account of Mindanao (discussed further below), in which he explains that the common currency in the Sulu and Mindanao was the kangan, a piece of Chinese coarse cloth, which was brought in quantity to Sulu by Chinese traders, and which thence circulated onward to Mindanao.<sup>10</sup> This Fundamental association of cloth with the Chinese may account tor the unusual term used in the treaty.

Perhaps one the most poignant aspects of this treaty is the addendum found on the reverse of the Malay version. Unlike the treaty itself, which was so evidently composed in English to suit the requirements of the East India Company, and then translated or "straightjacketed" into Malay, the addendum on the back-a strong rejection of the sale of opium, and a tight control on the sale of arms-appears to have been included at the request of the Malay side, judging from the detailed exposition in four lines of Malay, compared with the laconic one-line English translation, "Opium is contraband & arms & ammunition to any but the Sultan." This unnumbered clause is not found in the published text of the treaty.<sup>11</sup> In fact, this prohibition was strongly supported by Dalrymple himself;<sup>12</sup> the culprit responsible for developing the Sulu trade in opium and arms from the British base at Balambangan was the unscrupulous chief John Herbert, who also presided over the "colossal fraud" effected in Balambangan against the East India Company itself.<sup>13</sup>

Turning from the content of the treaty to its form, the first observation that can be made is the excellent formal standard of the Malay language used in the treaty, with no evident localisms, coupled with fine calligraphy. Of particular interest is the stylish execution of the letter nun, "n" of "sultan," written with a flourish and positioned above the rest of the word.<sup>14</sup> This same calligraphic nicety can be observed not only in the work of the professional scribe who drew up the treaty in Jolo in January 1761, but also in the signature of Sultan Azimuddin I, in his ratification of the treaty written in Manila in October of that year (figure 4).

An unusual aspect of the diplomatics of the document is when the various royal Sulu seals were used on documents that extended to two pages; the two sheets of paper were first folded along an inner vertical margin, with the seal applied across the folds, resulting in an impression of two halves when the paper was flattened out (figures 1, 3, and 6). On the other hand, the East India Company seals on the same documents are simply impressed on the flattened sheet of paper. This peculiar method ol scaling is not found in any other Muslim kingdom in Southeast Asia.<sup>15</sup> Finally, attention should be called to the ratification of the treaty by a large number of Sulu Datuk and Orang Kaya, reflecting the role of the Sulu nobility in the legislature of the state.<sup>16</sup>

## Royal Letters From Mindanao, 1776

Thomas Forrest (1729-1802) was a British sea captain who spent half a century plying the waters of the Malay archipelago, mostly in the service of the East India Company, but for the last decade of his life as a "Free Mariner" or independent trader. While employed in the Marine division of the East India Company settlement at Bengkulu in west Sumatra, Forrest undertook a voyage in 1775 to survey the north coast of New Guinea. Forrest traveled via the island of Balambangan off the north coast of Borneo, where a British trading post led by the aforementioned John Herbert had been established in 1773, arising out of Dalrymple's negotiations with the sultans of Sulu in the 1760s. On the return journey to Balambangan, Forrest spent eight months, from 5 May 1775 to 8 January 1776, in the sultanate of Maguindanao on the west coast of the island of Mindanao, during which time he was courteously hosted by the Rajah Moodo (Raja Muda, the viceroy or heir apparent) of Maguindanao and his father Fakymolano (Fakih Maulana), the former sultan Muhammad Khairuddin (r.1748-1755).<sup>17</sup>

In his account of the voyage (first published in London in 1779, with a second improved edition with plates issued in 1780 and republished in facsimile in 1969), Forrest gives a valuable description of the social, cultural, political, and economic life of Maguindanao in the late eighteenth century. On arrival, Forrest had to tread delicately due to the evident rift between Sultan Fakharuddin (r. 1755-€.1780), younger brother of Fakih Maulana, and the Raja Muda. Acting on the sage advice of his Bugis guide Tuan Haji, while ensuring that he paid respects to the sultan, Forrest allied himself with the court of the Raja Muda, and lodged in his fort. While in Maguindanao, Forrest received news that Balambangan had been sacked by the Sulus, and he therefore used his time in Mindanao to explore and survey possible alternative sites for a British trading settlement. On his departure in January 1776, Forrest carried with him two letters:

>I then took respectful leave of Raja Moodo. He delivered to me the two letters already mentioned; one to his Majesty, the other to the Company, with the presents. Nobody knew what they were, but himself and his father Fakymolano, who wrote the letters.<sup>18</sup>

The two letters, written in Malay, are now held in the British Library. They have never before been published, but their presence was not unknown: the letter to King George (figure 8) was exhibited (probably in the form of a color slide) in a talk on "the archives of the Honourable East India Company" by William Foster at the Royal Society of Arts in 1923, described as "a letter in Malay, from the Sultan of Mindanao (the most southerly of the Philippine Islands), to George III, offering an alliance, offensive and defensive, and promising facilities for British trade in his country.<sup>19</sup> The two letters are given below in the appendix in transliteration and English translation, accompanied by Forrest's own translation of the letter addressed to the king (doubtless the source of Foster's comments above).

The contents of the letters contain a few surprises, as they bear out Forrest's own account of the substance of his discussions with Fakih Maulana and the Raja Muda. The letters commence by proclaiming Raja Muda as the effective ruler of the state, raja di tana Maguindanao, stating that "the sultan is old and has relinquished his rule over all his coasts into the hands of the Raja Muda." An offer is made to the British for the use of any of the islands in the realm, such as Miangis or Ipa, as a site for a fortified post, with the promise of a further grant of a piece of land on the side facing mainland. Mutual assistance is agreed in the case of hostilities, followed by a proposal relating to currency:

>I am sending to you Sir a copper kusing, weighing two Chinese mace, if the Company wishes to send these here, of whatever quantity, I will accept them as currency in my dominions, 96 for one peso, 192 halfpieces for one peso, or 384 quarter pieces for one peso.

This suggestion appears to have been planted by Forrest for he writes in his book:

>Fakymolano and Rajah Moodo are willing to admit, as currency, a copper coin of two Chinese mace in weight, with the name of Kybad Zachariel on one side, and the Company's arms on the other; ninety-six of them were to pass for a Spanish dollar: this number was pitched upon as most divisible.<sup>20</sup>

The two letters-to King George III and the directors of the East India Company-are essentially the same in content, but statemanship is at work in the difference of nuance. That to the king is more bland in tone and pays compliments to the renown of the British name, anticipating Napoleon's famous characterization of the English as "a nation of shopkeepers" by stating, "the Spanish are all for interfering in our [religion] - the Dutch are all for taking over our government - but the English just want to trade." The episotle to the Company is rather more brisk and businesslike. While the letter to the king states "I agree to help the Company against its enemies and in return I ask the Company to assist me in Maguindanao," that to the Company states "I agree to help the Company against its enemies in the land of Maguindanao, but I do not agree to help beyond Maguindanao."

Forrest's own translation, which is only available for the letter to the king, appears to be faithful to the Malay original. The only obvious liberty taken is that in the Malay letters the gift to the king is specified as a glass stone - apparently some kind of mineral rarity<sup>21</sup> - while that to the Company is a consignment of cinnamon. The decision had evidently been taken by the East India Company that both gifts should go to the king, for Forrest's translation states, "I send to your Majesty a piece of glass stone, & a little cinnamon as a sample of what my Country Produces."

Turning from the content to the form, the letter is in many respects not a typical royal Malay letter, not least in that it was not written by a professional palace scribe, but by Fakih Maulana himself. His great learning is alluded to in the title by which he was commonly known, the Arabic Faqīh Mawlāna (Our Lord the Legal Expert). Fakih Maulana's handwriting is workaday rather than stylish, but the letters are written with care, and certain words, mainly of foreign origin, are fully vocalized. There is no religious letter heading or kepala surat as is commonly found in formal Malay letters, but the opening words are fully in accordance with standard Malay protocol: Surat ini dengan tanda puti hati datang dari ... (This letter comes with sincerity from ...). Thereafter, however, the language used is colloquial rather than courtly, evoking the working vocabulary of commerce and daily communication throughout the archipelago; for example, the address to the king uses the casual preposition sama for "to" rather than the more formal kepada or ke hadapan. In layout, the letter is also untraditional in that many of the lines are presented in new paragraphs, and dashes are employed at the end of sentences; traditional Malay in Jawi script did not employ punctuation or paragraphing. The letters end with the full names of Fakih Maulana and the Raja Muda in both Arabic and Latin script, followed by the Raja Muda's signature in Latin script. Both letters bear the lampblack seal of the Raja Muda, impressed on the top right corner of the sheet of paper.

The biggest surprise comes at the very bottom of both letters: the date. This is written very clearly in Malay as lima hari bulan Rabiulakhir pada hari Arba hijrat seribu serutus delapan puluh sembilan tahun dal 1189 (the 5th day of the month of Rabiulakhir, on Wednesday, the year of the hijrah one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine, the year dal, 1189), with the numerical form of the date, 1189, written in "European Arabic" numerals.<sup>22</sup> 5 Rabiulakhir 1189 is equivalent to 5 June 1775, just one month after Forrest arrived in Maguindanao; yet he clearly states that he the letters from the Raja Muda on the morning of his departure, 8 January 1776. The hijrah year 1189 lasted from 4 March 1775 to 20 February 1776, and the date of Forrest's departure, 8 January 1776, equates to 16 Zulkaidah 1189. It is highly unlikely that the learned Fakih Maulana mistakenly wrote Rabiulakhir, the fourth month of the year, for Zulkaidah, the eleventh month, in both the letters. On the other hand, it could be seen as surprising that in both letters the islands of Miangis and Ipa are suggested as possible sites for a British base, while Forrest had in fact decided on the island of Bunwoot as the best choice, and had secured its prant in September 1775. The implication is therefore that the letters were indeed written on 5 June 1775 but were not presented to Forrest until his departure.

Another manuscript document written by Fakih Maulana is held in the British Library: a map of riverine settlements in Maguindanao, annotated by Fakih Maulana in Arabic script and by Forrest in Latin script (figure 11). The document is described by Forrest in his book: "the chart of these countries and rivers, drawn by Fakymolano, is deposited in the British Museum" and was used as the basis for the map in Plate 18<sup>23</sup> of the second edition of 1780.<sup>24</sup>

Lastly, it is interesting to note Forrest's own analysis of the basis of the excellent relationship of mutual regard and respect that developed between him and Fakih Maulana and Raja Muda during his stay in Maguindanao, and that he was able to avoid getting embroiled in the local politics: he was not there to sell anything.

>I consider myself very lucky amongst them in having no cargo to dispose of. Had I brought any thing of that kind, I much question if I could have steered so clear of party<sup>25</sup> as I did: I might have gone to Topang<sup>26</sup> to sell my merchandise. On the contrary, having nothing but what was to bear my expenses, my freedom of mind enabled me to keep a certain line of conduct, without deviation.<sup>27</sup>

## The Linguistic Landscape Of Sulu And Mindanao

The writing traditions of the Muslim south of the Philippine islands have a long history, which is only gradually being revealed. So far, the earliest dateable examples known of manuscript documents written in Arabic script from the southern Philippines are two royal letters in Malay, one from Maguindanao dated 1701 and one from Sulu dated 1702, held in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Spain, recently documented by Roderick Orlina.<sup>28</sup> A small quantity of other eighteenth-century documents in Malay, Tausug, or Maguindanao written in Jawi are known (including those discussed in this paper), but it is only from the nineteenth century that larger volumes of such material survive, held primarily in the national archives of the Philippines, the USA, and the United Kingdom.<sup>29</sup>

Even more elusive are collections of manuscript books Sulu and Mindanao. Najeeb Saleeby's seminal work Moro History, Law and Religion, first published in 1905, described and published extracts from over twelve manuscripts on history, law, and sermons written in Maguindanao and Lausug,<sup>30</sup> but there has never been a published catalogue of manuscripts in these languages held in any institution, whether in the Philippines or elsewhere.<sup>31</sup> Undoubtedly, armed conflict has caused great losses, and such manuscripts that do survive have tended to be closely guarded and rarely made acessible, but some recent publications reflect the efforts of anthropologists and historians who have spent long periods of fieldwork gaining the trust of owners of private libraries.<sup>32</sup> It is primarily the religious manuscripts that have been documented through these initiatives: copies of the Qur'an, prayer books in praise of the Prophet Muhammad, and works on religious obligations and law, written mainly in Arabic and Malay, Tausug and Maranao.<sup>33</sup> The manuscripts studied so far confirm close links between religious scholars (ulama) in Mindanao and Sulu and other parts of the archipelago, particularly with Java and Aceh; Mirat al-tullab, a Malay work on Islamic law by the famous seventeenth-century Acehnese scholar Abdul Rauf, is mentioned as one of the sources of the Luwaran, the Maguindanao code of laws.<sup>34</sup>

Among the many details of interest in Forrest's account of Maguindanao are his scattered comments pertaining to language use and writing. Maguindanao was the language of daily use and in the court, and its use seems to have been widespread across the western part of the island of Mindanao. Most aristocrats knew Malay,<sup>35</sup> as did some of the women including the wife of the Raja Muda.<sup>36</sup> "The Sultan can speak good Malay, but chose to converse with me by an interpreter."<sup>37</sup>

Fakih Maulana and the Raja Muda knew Spanish<sup>38</sup> and could write in that language,<sup>39</sup> and the Raja Muda also knew some Latin.<sup>40</sup>

Fakih Maulana's literacy and learnedness is evident on numerous occasions, and Forrest often records him making notes.<sup>41</sup> He certainly owned some manuscripts:

>The following short account of the history of Maguindanao, is drawn from original records, in the possession of Fakymolano ... they wrote in the Magindanao tongue, and Arabic character. I took it down from Fakymolano's own mouth, who dictated in Malay.<sup>42</sup>

And yet Forrest never mentions a library or collection of books in the royal houses, though one relevant factor may be that during the civil war thirty years previously, "the great palace at the town was first plundered, and then burnt." When the sultan, Fakih Maulana and the Raja Muda signed and sealed a grant of the island of Bunwoot to the English East India Company on 12 September 1775, it was written in Spanish "by Abderagani, a native of Pampanga-once a slave, who, by turning Mussulman, had obtained his liberty."<sup>43</sup>

The use of written communications in Maguindanao to record certain important decisions, and the literacy of the sultan, is illustrated by Forrest's account of his departure. When he asked the Raja Muda for leave to depart, the Raja Muda said, "Go to the Sultan; and if he approves of your departure, desire him to write me a note, which you will bring yourself." During his audience, Forrest watched as the sultan "wrote on a slip of paper" the required assent.<sup>44</sup>

The general impression gained from Forrest's account 18 that Maguindanao was the main oral and written medium within the kingdom, and the British Library also holds two letters in Maguindanao dated 1746 written to the Spanish admiral Don Pedro Zacarias Villareal, one from Fakih Maulana, bearing his seal in the name of "Sultan Muhammad Syah Amiruddin" and signed in Latin characters with his name Jamdsa (Hamza), and the other bearing the seal of "Sultan Muhyiuddin ibn Sultan Djauddin."<sup>45</sup> Malay was used when necessary for communication with foreigners, and there was also familiarity with Spanish for important written documents, such as the land grant. What is perhaps surprising, in view of Forrest's very close intercourse with the Maguindanao nobility-during his eight months lodging in the Raja Muda's fort, Forrest spent nearly every evening with the Raja Muda and Fakih Maulana<sup>46</sup> - and lack of prejudice in his account, so unusual for that age,<sup>47</sup> is that there is no mention of the Arabic language or of Islamic books including the Qur'an. There must have been several people with knowledge of Arabic, including probably Fakih Maulana himself, for the Raja Muda seal bears an Arabic inscription with a grandiose title, āmir al-amarā' (prince of princes). One exception is therefore notable: as part of the funeral rites for the Watamama (the second in line to the throne after the Raja Muda), his distant relatives "by book sang dirges in honour of the defunct, and for the repose of his soul,"<sup>48</sup> indicating the use of what must have been a prayer book in Arabic.

From Mindanao, Forrest proceeded to Sulu, where he mentions that the "Sooloo tongue" (i.e., Tausug) was written in Arabic, with some variation; he also found that the "better sort speak Malay, and those who trade abroad, generally understand it."<sup>49</sup> The fine calligraphic hand of Sultan Azimuddin I has already been commented on above, and indeed he was fluent in both Arabic and Malay, having spent time in his youth with the Arab community in Batavia.<sup>50</sup> When he wrote to the Spanish king Philip V in 1847, his letters were in Arabic and Spanish,<sup>51</sup> and he also wrote to the sultan of Maguindanao in 1751 in Arabic.<sup>52</sup> It is therefore surprising to find that while the first two Sulu treaties-signed by Dalrymple with Muizzuddin in 1761 and Azimuddin II in 1763-were written in Malay and English, the third and fourth, signed in Azimuddin I's restoration, were in Tausug and English.

By the nineteenth century, there seems to have been a decline in the use of Malay in the southern Philippine islands, certainly for documents circulating within Spanish dominions; a brief survey of Arabic-script documents from Mindanao and Sulu in the National Archives of the Philippines yielded many in Tausug and Maguindanao but hardly any in Malay, although correspondence between Sulu and the British was still conducted in Malay. This compilation of references on language use and writing simply brings into focus how much work still needs to be done to gain a better understanding of the factors underpinning the choice of language for a variety of oral and written communications, in the richly multilingual environment of Sulu and Mindanao.
