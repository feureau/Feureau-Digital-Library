# Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje In Memory of the Centennial of His Birth

ROBERT VAN NIEL

This year academic circles in the Netherlands are celebrating the centennial of the birth of C. Snouck Hurgronje; Arabist, scholar of Indonesian affairs, and formateur of Dutch colonial policy. Most Dutch scholars and many students of Indonesian affairs would readily agree that few men have had as intimate acquaintance with the Indonesian archipelago and its people and have had as wide a reputation as an expert on this part of the world as the late Snouck Hurgronje. Unfortunately his writings and policies are known to English-reading scholars only at second hand. Except for a few brief articles, only his books, Mekka and The Achehnese? and his lectures in Mohammedanism* have appeared in English. Other important writings have appeared in German and French, but the great bulk are in Dutch. There are presently plans to translate some parts of Snouck Hurgronje's collected workst and also to make available certain writings which were done after the collected works were published, but the publication plans for these translations and reprints are still indefinite.

Of more definite and immediate interest to the students of Indonesian affairs, but in no way solving the problem of making Snouck Hurgronje's writings available in a wider field, is the appearance this year of the first volume of what promises to be a three-volume collection of the recommendations which Snouck Hurgronje made to the Netherlands Indian government.‘ These volumes will be strictly food for specialists, for they make no promise to deal with any subject matter which has not already been touched upon in the collected works. They should, however, provide the specialist with a better understanding of the man, Snouck Hurgronje, and of his struggles and difficulties in establishing his ideas, and of details of the many problems with which he had to cope. For these purposes they will be invaluable and their appearance will be eagerly awaited as a contribution to our understanding of Indonesian social and political development.

Professor Van Niel is in the Department of History at Russell Sage College.

Snouck Hurgronje’s life was devoted to scholarship and was focused on the academic circles of Europe. It is only fitting, therefore, that the centennial activities of this year should be conducted mainly at academie centers and be directed chiefly toward academicians, for Snouck Hurgronje was part of this atmosphere and his students and colleagues carry on in the same spirit there today. Few academicians anywhere and anytime, however, have led as active and adventurous a life as Snouck Hurgronje.

‘The story of his visit to Mecea in 1884-85 has become legend among students of Arabian affairs the world over. As a young professor of Islamic law and religion at the University of Leiden he conceived the notion of verifying some of his ideas at the Muslim religious center of Mecca. Disguised as an Arab he lived in Mecca for several months as a Muslim scholar. From this experience came his book on. ‘Meeca* which placed him in the top ranks of Arabists. The Mecea adventure also revealed characteristics which were always to be identified with him: the seientist’s desire for firsthand information and verification, and the humanist’s striving to understand the spirit and ambitions of a people.

A scholar with such an intimate knowledge of Islam was a valuable asset to a government which in the Far Tast ruled over a predominantly Muslim people. Already in 1889, the year the Mecea book appeared, the Netherlands government began consulting Snouck Hurgronje, and the following year he arrived in Netherlands India to serve as adviser to the government on Islamic Affairs. Although he left Netherlands India in 1906 to return to his academic chair at Leiden, he continued to advise the government on Islamic affairs and on general policy in Indonesia until his death in 1936.

Snouck Hurgronje did more than influence the Islamic policy of the colonial government: in a very real sense he created it and, along with his successors, implemented it. In Indonesia religion cannot be divorced from the other aspects of life, and similarly Islamie policy could not be separated from general policies toward the indigenous people. This extension of work was reflected in the change of his official designation to Adviser for Native and Arabie Affairs in 1809.

Upon reaching the East Indies his first step toward gradually constructing, an Islamic poliey was to dispel the prevailing prejudices and misunderstandings concerning Islam. His work on Mecea had contributed to this clarification in that it refuted the prevailing imputation of fanaticism aseribed to those Indonesians who had made the pilgrimage to the Muslim holy places. He had observed that only a few Indonesian pilgrims, specifically the Achinese of North Sumatra, who since 1874 had been engaged by government troops in a desultory war, were rabidly opposed to the Netherlands Indian government. Most Indonesian Muslims were rather complaisant with the government. Their disposition, Snouck Hurgronje believed, would grow even friendlier as the government improved conditions within the archipelago. Sympathy and noninterference toward ‘Muslim institutions and aims formed a cornerstone of the policy which Snouck Hurgronje evolved.

But this sympathy and noninterference were to have limits. Movements which

resorted to the call of a holy war against. nonbelievers in order to disturb the peace of the archipelago were to be dealt with severely. Snouck Hurgronje was well aware that a government of nonbelievers is by its very nature illegal in the eyes of Islam. He also realized that unchecked uprisings in the name of Muslim unity would by their very nature force the temporizing messes of Muslims to support them or at least to tolerate them passively. Therefore his policy toward dissidence was unequivocal: it was to be dealt with severely by the government.

‘This aspect of his policy is clearly shown in his attitude toward the war in 'Achin. Soon after his arrival in the archipelago he had spent several months living among the Achinese before sending his report to the government in Batavia, In a revised form this was later published as his second major work, De Atjehers.? His immediate recommendations were that the conflict be pushed with the utmost vigor to a rapid conclusion. Previous policies had considered the dissident Achinese as rabble rousers who would soon be dispatched from Achinese society by the more peace-loving citizenry. Snouck Hurgronje realized, however, that this internal cleansing could never occur in the face of extremist Muslim sentiment, and consequently he urged his policy of decisive action to bring the war to a close, Once the strife was ended, however, he recommended that all energies be turned to the reestablishment and reintegration of Achinese life. The ultimate failure of the government to follow this final advice was a major factor in his decision to return to his academic chair at Leiden.

Kindness, humanism, and understanding toward the Indonesian life patterns were, however, the real basis of Snouck Hurgronje’s work. Nowhere is this more ‘clearly shown than in the series of letters he wrote to a Semarang newspaper in the guise of a retired Indonesian civil servant. Much as he liked and understood Indonesian culture, however, he was convinced that the West had something of value to offer Indonesians. Much of his life was directed toward creating among Indonesians a sense of enlightened self-interest which would enable them to understand what Western culture could do for them. In this realm of cultural synthesis, Snouck Hurgronje was to conduct his greatest and most thankless work

It isimpossible to set forth in brief the full scope of Snouck Hurgronje’s work of cultural synthesis, but two major aims seem to emerge as dominant themes. These are the aim of improving the quality of the corps of colonial administrators, and the desire to bring Western education—not merely instruction—to the Indonesians.

Since about 1870 the colonial civil administration had been stripped of much of its regulatory function, and had, at least in theory, been placed in an advisory position. Snouck Hurgronje felt that this advisory personnel should be the finest possible bearers and exponents of Western culture, for in their intimate contacts with Indonesians they were in key positions to influence the Indonesian way of life. Consequently he continually urged measures for improving and broadening

the education of the Dutch civil administrators. His efforts were crowned with success about the time of the First, World War when the recommendations of his commission to investigate the education of these administrators were accepted.

Less succossful were his efforts in two correlated problems. Though endeavoring to improve the caliber of the Dutch civil administration, he maintained that this corps should be consistently withdrawn as a factor in Indonesian life and should eventually disappear entirely. The trend of the times seemed to dictate just the opposite, however, so that the years after 1900 witnessed a burgeoning of the Dutch civil administration. He was further dismayed by the well-intentioned but persistent interference by the Dutch administrators in Indonesian life. Gentle pressure by the European adviser upon the Indonesian administrators to accomplish European-formulated aims seemed to become the accepted manner of operation. This had not been Snouck Hurgronje’s intention. He raised his voice against this practice, but with limited success.

‘The second major theme of Snouck Hurgronje’s work was to make Westernstyle education available to Indonesians. He was thoroughly convinced that the best way to strengthen the imperial bonds between the Netherlands and Netherlands India was to effect an “association” of Indonesians with Dutch culture. This was to be accomplished by making the best in Dutch culture available to Indonesians, but not by forcing them to become brown-skinned Dutchmen. Universal education for all Indonesians was his ultimate aim, and a self-regulating, efficent, and progressive Indonesian society deeply loyal to the motherland was his ultimate hope. How this dream went astray is a major part of the story of Netherlands India during the early twentieth century, and it is a story that carries far beyond the confines of Snouck Hurgronje’s life and policies.

In recalling this hundredth anniversary of Snouck Hurgronje’s birth, we can perhaps do no better than to reiterate the eulogy of a French observer of Indonesian affairs at the turn of the century. Chailley-Bert, after discoursing upon Snouck Hurgronje’s abilities and contributions, said, “... il est de cos ouvrages que Dieu tire à peu d’exemplaires.”®
