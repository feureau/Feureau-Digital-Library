PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Despite the existence of a large body of Javanese historical (babad) literature on
Dipanagara (1785-1855) and the period of the Java War (1825-30), very few texts
have been published or made available in any form.' The following edition
and translation in English and Indonesian Malay of Codex Orientalis 2114 (Babed
Dipanagara) of the Leiden University Library is thus intended to partially fill this
gap in modern Javanese historiography. In particular, the text and detailed historical
notes are offered as a contribution to the understanding of the Javanese view of
events during a crucially important period of Javanese history.

The present babad, which was originally translated as part of the present
author's doctoral thesis," has been singled out for publication for a variety of
reasons. First, because it is one of the earliest contemporary accounts available, hav-
ing been written at the Surakarta court shortly after the outbreak of the Java War in
July 1825. Secondly, because this text, which is written in a clear court idiom, is
short enough (52 folio sized pages in manuscript) to be translated without too much
difficulty. Most of the other historical accounts dealing with Dipanagara go into
many hundreds of folios in the originals and frequently present problems of textual
interpretation. Thirdly, because the Surakarta babad provides an interesting and criti-
cal view of Dipanagara, written as it was at a court which was both hostile to
Yogyakarta and deplored the prince's relations with the religious communities.
Finally, because, for the short period of weeks covered by this babad, there are
numerous other sources, both European and Javanese, which can be used to cor-
roborate and refute the babad's descriptions. Thus it is possible to establish a
reasonably accurate account of the events and, at the same time, test the overall
reliability of the present text as a source in its own right. In this instance the degree
of historical reliability is remarkable and throughout his work, the babad writer has
shown a grasp of accurate detail which can be confirmed time and again in the other
Javanese and European sources. In a wider context, therefore, the present text can
be regarded as a test case for assessing the historical value of Javanese babad materi-
als in the early nineteenth century. At a time when powerful arguments have been
advanced to support the theory of a decline in the accuracy of certain branches of
Javanese historiography in the eighteenth century,} it is important to be able to
stress the fact that the writing of Javanese accounts dealing with contemporary
events remained as versatile and as precise as ever.

On the other levels too, this babad is of value especially for the study of
Javanese social and cultural history. The literary construction of the chronicle, for
example, in a number of different scenes, reflects the theatre forms which domi-
nated cultural life in Surakarta in the early nineteenth century. Indeed, the text is
suffused with the imagery and drama of the wayang Aulit (shadow puppet theatre)
and wayang topeng (masked dance theatre), which are known to have been favoured
by the Surakarta ruler, Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820), himself a great patron of the
arts. The babad thus provides a useful insight into the hitherto unresearched artistic
milieu of the Surakarta court during the reign of Pakubuwana IV and his successors.

Babed Dipanagara

Furthermore, there are many descriptions and vignettes in the narrative which are
enlightening for social historians. These include the descriptions of Dipanagara's
improvements to his lands at Sélarong (L. 12-16), the unscrupulous methods of the
Yogyakarta police officials (Maceran) (II. 14-16), the jago (lit.: 'fighting cock") qual-
ities associated with Javanese bandit chiefs (IIL 18-19), the difficulties of road con-
struction work in the minutely fragmented core regions (nager ageng) of the Cen-
tral Javanese courts (VI. 1-10), the types of money in circulation (II. 16; IV. 4) and
the sorts of clothes worn by people in Java at this time (IL 14; VHI 11; VIII 16;
X1. 5). All these details help to deepen our understanding of Javanese society on
the eve of the Java War. They also refute the claim, made by some critics of Javan-
ese babad sources, that the latter only mirror the narrow viewpoint of court and
ignore social realities. In this edition, the social comments have been set in the con-
text of other contemporary sources, mostly European, which deal with the economic
and social conditions in Java in the early nineteenth century. The notes from these
sources are intended to go some way towards sketching in the main social and
economic issues which precipitated the Java War, although a full discussion of

developments during this period must await.the outcome of further monographic
study.*

As an historian, I make no prétensions to great expertise in the field of Javan-
ese literature. The fact that-this text has reached publication at all is due to the
generous help of numerous scholars and friends. The first draft of the transliteration
of the manuscript was completed in Jakarta in 1971 by Bapak Djoko Hardojo, an
editor of the Javanese magazine Kenthi. 'The preliminary English translation was
then prepared in Yogyakarta with the help of the late Drs. Mudjanattistomo. Later,
the drafts were read through by Prof. P.J. Zoetmulder, SJ., Dr. Th.G.Th. Pigeaud
and Dr. M.C. Ricklefs, who all offered valuable comments on the translation. In
particular, Prof. G.W.J. Drewes painstakingly corrected my numerous initial errors
and helped me to establish a more accurate final version of the English translation.
Meanwhile, my rendering of the Javanese text in Indonesian Malay was kindly
checked through by my wife, Noes Carey, and by Dra: Dewi Mariah, both native
speakers of Indonesian. The collection of European manuscript materials was facili-
tated by the constant assistance of Mr. F.G.P. Jaquet of the Koninklijk Instituut
(Leiden), Mr. M.G.H.A. de Graaff of the Algemeen Rijksarchief (The Hague) and
Miss Soemartini, the Director of the Indonesian:National Archives (Arsip Nasional)
in Jakarta. Thanks are also due to the Council of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal
Asiatic Society for publishing this study, which lies far outside the normal bounds of
Malaysian history, and to Magdalen College (Oxford) for providing me with gener-
ous financial support, good company and fine surroundings in which to work.

To all those named above and to many others, especially in Indonesia and the
Netherlands, I owe a deep debt of gratitude for their help made this monograph

possible. But any faults and shortcomings which remain are entirely my own and I
assume sole responsibility for these.

The two year delay in the publication of this book has been caused by local publishing difficulties in Malaysia. That
it has appeared at all is due to the unstinting efforts of the Editor of the MBRAS, Tan Sri Dato Mubin Sheppard, to
whom go my heartfelt thanks

NOTE ON THE SPELLING, PRONUNCIATION
AND ETYMOLOGY OF THE NAME 'DIPANAGARA'

is the linguistically correct romanised spelling of the prince's name and it has
been used throughout this book. 'Dipanegara' is a variant spelling which occurs
frequently in contemporary documents and is used by many present-day writers. It is less
linguistically correct, although 'nagara' and 'négara' have become fully interchangeable in
Modern Javanese.

The consonant indicators (ha', 'na', 'ca', 'ra', 'a' etc.), known as ak saras in Javanese,
are always pronounced with an 'o' (8) sound (as in the English 'taught") provided they are
not followed by a syllable with a different vowel sound (e.g. 'r', "k1") or occur in a 'closed"
syllable (e.g. 'rar', 'kar'). In these cases the aksaras are pronounced with a flat 'a' (a) (as in
the English 'father'): hence "arf, 'dku', 'raras' and 'karta'. Also in words with three
'simple' aksaras (i.e. those without special vowel indicators), the "&" sound of the first
changes into an 'a" sound: hence 'sigara', 'nagara', Thus the correct Modern Javanese
pronunciation of Dipanagara's name is 'Dipnagard', or Dipdnegara' if the variant
spelling is used. Most of the prince's modern descendants: (e.g. those living in Ujung
Pandang) spell their family name phonetically: 'Diponegoro'.

In his conversations with Lt. J.H; Knoerle (Journal', p. 10), Dipanagara gave an
interesting etymological analysis of his name stating that was derived from
the Sanskrit 'Dipa' ('lamp') and meant someone 'who spread enlightenment or who
possessed life and force'. Since 'nagara' is the equivalent of 'an area, province or country',
Dipanagara considered his name to indicate a man 'who gave enlightenment, power and
prosperity to a country'. The usual derivation of the Javanese 'Dipa' as used in Javanese
proper names is from the Sanskrit 'Dwipa' ('elephant'), see GR, vol. I, p. 587,

INTRODUCTION

I. THE MANUSCRIPT

The Javanese babad transliterated and translated here under the title, 'An Account
of the Outbreak of the Java War (1825-30) is contained in Codex Orientalis 2114
of the Leiden University Library collection of oriental manuscripts. This manuscript,
which formed part of the private collection of Professor Taco Roorda, was bought
from his heirs by the library in 1874 along with various other Javanese manuscripts
mainly of Surakarta origin.' It has a pencil note-on the first page written in Roorda's
own handwriting describing it as the 'Babad Dhiponogoro' and has his signature
below it. On the next page, by way of an introduction, the babad copyist has put the
title Strat Babadipun Dipantgaran (Chronicle of Dipanagara). A.C. Vreede, in his
catalogue of Javanese manuscripts in the Leiden collection,* wrote that it consisted
of a fragment of the history of Dipanagara written in the beautiful hand of the cariks
(scribes) of the Surakarta court, He noticed that it deviated completely from all the
other Leiden manuscript versions of the Bubad Dipanagere, the collection of Javan-
ese chronicles dealing with the life and times of Dipanagara." The manuscript itself
is only 52 folio sized pages long and is written. on Netherlands-Indies government
paper in a fine black quadratic script with red and green rubrics at the start of the
cantos and verses." It ends abruptly at the top of the fifty second folio and it appears
that another canto, with an unidentifiable metre, was meant to follow.

The origins of the manuscript are not clear, but it is possible that it was a frag-
ment taken from a much longer court chronicle: The use of Dutch government
paper points to the fact thatit was a copy:and on the title page, in the same hand,
three other manuscripts are- referred to which may have formed part of the same
bundle." The date of the manuscript (see below pt. 11) suggests that it might have
been made for the gifted Javanese linguist, A.D. Cornets de Groot Jr., who served
in Surakarta first as an dre voor de Javaansche Taal (student in the Javanese language)
(1819-23) and then as Secretary of the Residency (1823-27). It is known, for
example, that he was on especially close terms with the Surakarta Patih (prime
minister), Raden Adipati Sasradiningrat II (1812-1846), who lent him many Javan-
ese manuscripts from the Surakarta kraton (court) for his language studies'" and who
may have been the patron under whose aegis this babad was written (see below pt.
111). But it is significant that there is no mention of a Babad D/panagare amongst the
Javanese and Malay manuscripts bought by the missionary scholar J.F.C. Gericke,
from the estate of Cornets de Groot, after the latter's untimely death in the Nether-

lands in 1829.!* Furthermore, if it had been retained by his heirs, it should have
formed part of the A.D. Cornets de Groot collection which was deposited in the

Leiden University Library in 1871."

XV

Babad Dipanagara

A more likely explanation is that the babad was copied either for use in the
Javanese Language Institute (Instituut voor de Javaansche Taal) which Gericke set
up in the Sunan's capital in 1832, or directly for Roorda himself after he had
become Professor at the Delft Royal Academy for engineers and colonial civil ser-
vants in 1842.!* Both C.F. Winter Sr., the official interpreter (¢ranslatewr) of Javan-
ese at the Surakarta Residency (1825-1859), and J. A. Wilkens (1813-1888), a stu-
dent of Winter, were active in collecting Javanese manuscripts in Surakarca at this
time and the copy could have been made on their orders. The manuscript could
then have reached Roorda when the materials of the Surakarta Language Institute
were sent to Delft after its disbandment in 1843, or dispatched directly to Roorda at
a later date. Roorda's handwriting is the earliest to appear on the babad and materi-
als for the study of Javanese were much in demand in Delft after the Royal
Academy had just been opened.'" The three other manuscripts which were copied
at the same time as the Babad Dipanagare can also be traced in Roorda's collection."

Whatever the origins of the babad were, it does not appear that Roorda made
any use of it during his lifetime, despite the fact that in 1860 he published a Dutch
translation of a portion of another version of the Babed Dipanagera which deals
with the outbreak of the Java War.!" The -first person to make a brief summary of
the contents of the present manuscript was Vreede in 1892 and it bears notes writ-
ten by him in pencil in the margins as well as some corrections to the text.!" Since
Vreede's survey, it has not been the subject of further study.

IL THE DATE OF THE MANUSCRIPT

The date given at the beginning of the manuscript, Kemis Wage, 19 Besar, teu» Be,
AJ. 1752, converts into Thursday 4 August 1825. The: scribe mentioned that he
began writing at eleven o'clock at night, which, according to Javanese reckoning
would fix the date on the fourth. This is because the Javanese day changes at sunset
and not at midnight as in western systems. If the latter was strictly adopted, the
date should read Wednesday 3 August 1825, since the manuscript was begun at ele-
ven p.m. on that day, This means that the composition of the babad was commenced
exactly two weeks after the- Dutch attack on Dipanagara's residence at Tégalréja just
outside Yogyakarta (Wednesday 20 July 1825), an action which marked the start of
the Java War. The chronicle was therefore written when Dipanagara's campaign
against the Dutch and their allies in the Yogyakarta kraton was in its very earliest
stages. Furthermore, the babad does not seem to have spanned a very long period.
The latest date which can be identified in the episodes referred to in the text is
Friday 5 August. This was the day when the Yogyakarta official, Raden Tuménggung
Ranadiningrat, was wounded in a skirmish with Dipanagara's forces in the streets of
the Sultan's capital."" The earliest incidents covered by the babad are those con-
nected with the improvements to the minor roads around Yogyakarta which took
place in late May and early June 1825 and which caused Dipanagara's final break
with the Dutch.?" Thus the text covers a time span of just over two months and
deals in detail with the immediate developments leading up to the outbreak of the

Java War, the Dutch reactions to the events and the first hostilities (see below pr.
X).

If the date given in the babad is accepted as being genuine this would make it
the oldest extant manuscript version of the Babad Dipanagare written by an

XVI

Introduction

immediate contemporary. Dipanagara's own autobiographical account, which he
drew up in exile in Menado, was not composed until nearly two years after the end
of the Java War in 1830 (see below pt. V.A.). Whereas the two other accounts writ-
ten by participants in the events, Cakranagara's Buke Kédbung Kibo and Jayadining-
rat's 'Sketches on the Java War', were not put together until 1842-3 and 1857
respectively (see below pt. V.B. and E.). It should be noted, however, that the dat
ing of the present babad as it now stands is somewhat unusual. In particular, it is
rare for an early nineteenth century chronicle to have numerals and not Javanese
chronograms («mdraséngkala) to indicate the dates. Likewise, the inclusion of the
Christian year, 1825, alongside the Javanese date reflects a certain degree of Euro-
pean influence on the manuscript's composition. This is further borne out by the
spelling of many Dutch. names with the sasra swara (letter), 'a', and by the pre-
sence of a handful of Dutch words in the manuscript." The earliest period that dat-
ing from the Christian calendar was used in other Javanese manuscripts relating to
Dipanagara was in 1876, when the first copy of Pangeran Suryanagara's court
chronicle was composed in Yogyakarta (see below pr. V.C.). Before that time only
chronograms and Javanese dates were employed. Perhaps the peculiarities of the
present text in this respect are an indication of-the greater Dutch influence on the
mores of the Surakarta court when compared to those of Yogyakarta during the same
period."" They may also be connected with the fact that the manuscript was prob-
ably copied on the orders of the Dutch. But they do not necessarily mean that the
dates given at the start of this babad should be rejected as unauthentic.

III. THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE MANUSCRIPT

Neither the name of the patron who commissioned the work nor that of the scribe
are mentioned in the babad, but Vreede's opinion that the script used in the text
originates from Surakarta is undoubtedly correct. The same neat quadratic script was
used on official Surakerta correspondence dating from the period of Pakubuwana VI
(1823-30), and it can be considered peculiar to the Sunan's court."" Unfortunately,
this does not help us to locate the original author or patron of the work. Since the
present manuscript was almost certainly a copy, it was probably transcribed by a
court cerik working on the orders of Cornets de'Groot, Winter or Wilkens. After a
study of the text, however, it seems possible to hazard the suggestion that the origi-
nal babad was written under the'patronage of Raden Adipati Sasradiningrat II of
Surakarta. Besides the latter's interest in Javanese literature, he also wielded consid-
erable influence in the Surakarta kraton at the time of the outbreak of the Java War
by virtue of his position as an unofficial guardian of the young Sunan, Pakubuwana
VL** If Sasradiningrat was the patron of the babad, this would explain why so much
information concerning co-operation with Yogyakarta on road construction projects
was included in the text and why the Yogyakarta Patih, Danuréja IV (1813-1847),
occupies such a central place in the narrative."

The office of the Surakarta prime minister could be expected to have main-
tained close contacts with Yogyakarta throughout this period. There were many
matters which had to be dealt with in common by both courts. Various legal, ter-
ritorial and agrarian questions, which arose in the nagars agung (core regions of the
realm), were officially settled by the Patihs who met periodically at Klathen, mid-
way between the courts. The two prime ministers also corresponded with each other
over criminal cases, for it was common for criminals to seek refuge in the territories

XVI

Babad Dipanagara

controlled by different princely states." Moreover, apart from these official con-
tacts, there were many clandestine links between the Central Javanese kratons which
sometimes involved the Patihs. Thus, in 1812, Sasradiningrat's predecessor, Raden
Adipati Cakranagara (1810-12), played a leading role in maintaining the secret cor-
respondence between the Sunan and the Sultan which eventually precipitated the
British attack on Yogyakarta (19-20 June 1812). Indeed, it is interesting that the
correspondence itself was largely instigated by Pakubuwana IV, because he wished
to keep himself better informed on the viewpoints of his Yogyakarta rival.?"

Other members of the court communities also had their own channels of com-
munication. Mangkunigara II of Surakarta (1796-1835), an unswerving enemy
of the Sultan, kept a close watch on the Yogyakarta court and apparently en-
joyed relating malicious gossip about his opponent to the Surakarta Resident."*
Personal relationships between princes at the different courts were likewise impor-
tant. Some religious teachers counted members of both kratons amongst their pupils
and this must have led to closer personal contacts between noblemen and officials in
Yogyakarta and Surakarta at this time."" Occasionally, private visits were paid by
moblemen to opposing courts: shortly before the Java War, for example,
Pakubuwana VI's army commander was reported to have made a clandestine, night
call to one of the princes. in the Yogya kraton," and later Dipanagara recalled that
he had made the acquaintance of two Surakarta Pangerans on the occasion of their
visits to Yogyakarta." Meanwhile, a flow of unofficial messengers kept the links
between the courts open. In 1812, sxtnis (men of religion) from both kratons car-
ried secret messages between the rulers, and, in 1815, at the time of the abortive
Sepoy plot in Central Java, members of the gladhags (porters'.guilds) served as emis-
saries for Pakubuwana IV and the British-Indian soldiers in the Yogya and Sala
garrisons."

The territorial situation in Central Java was also more fluid before 1825 than it
came to be after the Java War, This was because of the close juxtaposition of
Surakarta, Yogyakarta-and MangkunZgaran landholdings in the nagare the
central apanage areas of Mataram, Pajang and Kédhu. In these regions, villages and
tracts of land held by one court were often placed directly adjacent to desas and
areas controlled by another court. It was sometimes even the case that separate vil-
lages were divided between all three courts."? This gave rise to interesting situations,
for Dutch officials resident in one court town would frequently get information
about developments in an area ruled by another princely state, before their col-
leagues who were accredited to that state. Thus, in July 1825, firm news of
Dipanagara's warlike intentions reached the Yogyakarea Resident, A.H. Smissaert,
first by way of the Resident of Surakarta, who reported a movement in a village
belonging to Dipanagara near Surakarta in the Pajang area."" Later, during the Java
War itself, many Surakarta desas were forced to make common cause with
Dipanagara's supporters because they lay between Yogyakarta territory.""

All these contacts, both official and unofficial, m~ant that the degree of accurate
information concerning events in Central Java was considerable at both courts in the
early nineteenth century. Moreover, situations which were likely to prove difficult
or politically dangerous were closely watched. In October 1823, when Raden Mas
Sapérdan's appointment as Sunan Pakubuwana VI threatened to throw Surakarta

XVII

Introduction

into confusion, Dipanagara related that people in Yogyakarta at the time were of the
frm conviction that the appointment would give rise to a rebellion of the Surakarta
princes against the Dutch government.>® Likewise, in July 1825, the Surakarta court
seems to have been in close touch with the events which were taking place in
Yogyakarta through the medium of religious teachers such as Kyai Maja. Indeed,
many princes appear to have been on the verge of going over to Dipanagara, before
the prompt arrival of General H.M. de Kock on 30 July, reassured them that the
Dutch were taking measures to contain the rebellion."" After the General's arrival,
they probably continued ty receive detailed reports about the early course of the
fighting against Dipanagara from the MangkunZgaran and Kasunanan troop detach-
ments which were sent to reinforce the Yogyakarta garrison in late July3® It is
interesting in this respect that the first person to provide accurate information to the
Dutch about Dipanagara's headquarters at Sélarong was a cavalry captain (rifmeesfer)
of the Mangkun@garan Legion who was captured by Dipanagara's forces in carly
August whilst on convoy duty.""

In view of the above, it is not surprising that a Surakarta pzjangge (court poet)
should have been in a position to write a highly accurate account of the events sur-
rounding the outbreak of the Java War in Yogyakarta. Moreover, if he had connec-
tions with Sasradiningrat, who occupied such an influential position in Surakarta at
this time and who was directly involved with the dispatch of the Sunan's troops to
Yogyakarta, the amount of information available to him would have been all the
greater. We shall see below how another member of the Surakarta Patih's staff, the
future Raden Adipati Cakranagara I of Purwaréja, was also able to draw up a
detailed and precise history of the same period on the basis of reports available to
him in Surakarta and his own experiences on the battlefront (see below pr. V.B.)

Iv. THE VIEWPOINT OF THE AUTHOR

Although there was very little sympathy in Surakarta for the person of Dipanagara,
many people at the Sunan's court secretly supported his stand against the Dutch.
Both courts had suffered equally from the sweeping annexations of their territory by
the European government-during the period of Daendels (1808-11) and Raffles
(1811-16), and from the precipitate abolition of the land rent in the princely states
in May 1823. At the same time, the Dutch government's handling of the Jabarang-
kah and Karang Kobar annexations in January 1825 and its scarcely concealed ter-
ritorial designs on the western mancanagare provinces of Bagélen and Banyumas had
caused as much anxiety in Surakarta as in Yogyakarta." The politics of the Sunan's
court were never as overtly hostile to the Dutch as those pursued in Yogyakarta,
but deep feelings of bitterness towards the colonial government always existed
below the surface. Thus, whilst Surakarta afforded Dipanagara no direct assistance at
the start of the hostilities and few of the Sunan's officials fought for the prince during
the war itself, there is evidence that many Sala courtiers were privately pleased by
his campaign against the Dutch. One of these silent admirers was Pakubuwana VI,
who, emulating the policies of previous Surakarta rulers, planned to reap substantial
political rewards from the disturbances in the Sultanate.*' This generally favourable
attitude in Surakarta court circles towards Dipanagara's resolute anti-European
stance is clearly reflected in the present babad. Thus the author has evidently taken
some relish in depicting the prince's humiliating treatment of Dutch officials (VIL.
22-24) and he has portrayed the latter as being totally dependant on the advice of

XIX

Babad Dipanagare

their Javanese colleagues. In Yogyakarta, Surakarta and Semarang, the Residents are
shown to defer completely to the political expertise of the local Javanese officials
(IV. 19-29; VL 4-8; VL 17-23; VL 32-36; VIL 2-10; VIII 2-6; VIII 45-47;
X. 16-21; XII 9-17; XII. 26-28). He also seems to have understood the nature
of Dipanagara's enmity with various members of the Yogya court on the eve of the
Java War. Figures with whom Dipanagara was particularly at variance, such as
Wiranagara and Paku Alam, are therefore described in a disparaging way as cowards
and fops (V. 32-34; VIII. 49-50). Of the prince's antagonists, only Danuréja is cast
in a positive light in the babad, an exception which may derive from Sasradiningrat's
role in the composition of the text."

One of the most interesting features of the babad writer's portrayal of the main
characters in his narrative, is the way in which he has almost instinctively compared
them to figures in the Javanese wayang (shadow puppet theatre). Wiranagara, for
example, the double-dealing commander of the Sultan's bodyguard, is brilliantly
equated with Patih Arya Sangkuni, the devious adviser of the Kurawa faction in the
Mahabharata cycle of wayang plays (VIL 50).-Similarly, Dipanagara is likened in a
critical way to the handsome but shallow Raden Samba, the son of Prabu Krésna,
ruler of Dwarawati (VIII 21 and see below). Meanwhile, the Dutch officials, Smiss-
aett and Chevallier, are depicted alternately as giants (bursa) and clown-retainers
(panakawan) (IV, 8-12), two classifications which seem to have sprung readily to
the minds of Javanese when dealing with the Dusch in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries What makes these descriptions eve more intriguing is that
in some cases they clearly firted the physical appearances of the historical figures
concerned. Thus Smissaert, who was characterised in one European source as a
'small, fat and shy man', was portrayed by another contemporary observer as a 'fine,

little Sancho (Panza), the most archetypal parakawan-figure in European litera-
ture. **

The use of wayang imagery in the Javanese chronicles concerning Dipanagara
can also be seen in Cakranagata's Buk Kédbang Keo and in Dipanagara's autobio-
graphical babad (see below pt. V.A.and-B): But, whereas in these two latter works,
the imagery was evoked for specific purposes of spiritual and political legitimation,
in this babad it has been used mainly for dramatic effect."" Indeed, the work itself
seems to have been conceived and written up in the manner of a wayang wong or
wayang topeng performance with set scenes (adigan) and sharply delineated actors.
Nowhere is this influence of the wayang on the artistic structure of the babad
clearer than in the description of the Yogyakarta police corps (Macenar) as they
prepared to set out for Tégalréja (II. 14). The description of their arrogant posture
and cwirled black moustaches distinctly recalls the appearance of the gegab (forceful)
male dancers in Javanese dance dramas.+* The battle scenes are also cast in a classi-
cal wayang manner: in the fight between the Macarnen and Dipanagara's men at
Tegalreja, for example, the latter are shown to prevail over their undisciplined
adversaries (II. 12-17), in much the same fashion as the setria (warriors) conquer
the flailing butas (giants) in the prang £¥mbang episodes in the wayang.*" Even the
humoristic interludes (Gnyolan), which are an integral part of all wayang perfor-
mance, are to be found in this babad. One of these is the scene when the defeated
police official, Macan Laut, is deprived of his uniform by Dipanagara's bodyguards
(IH. 20-25).4®

Introduction

These artistic and theatrical effects in the present text undoubtedly reflect the
arest popularity of wayang performances at the Surakarta court in the early
sineteenth century. One of Pakubuwana VI's favourite banyolans, for example was
reported to have been rather similar to the one reproduced in this text.*" But it was
Pakubuwana VI's grandfather, Pakubuwana IV, who was particularly renowned as a
great patron of the theatrical arts. Besides being an author of repute, he was also an
sccomplished dancer and puppeteer (@Whalang)5° During his reign, Javanese war
dances, such as the arrow-dance (bike jéhing) and the fighting dance (bokse
prawireng), as well as the masked dance performances (wayeng topeng) from the
Panji cycle appear to have been especially popular. On certain occasions, the Sunan
himself would take part in dance performances with a few of his close relations and
he kept troops of prawireng and tepeng dancers at court."" Wayang kulit and wayang
élithik (shadow theatre with wooden puppets depicting plays from the Damar Wulan
cycle) were also frequently performed. The former were so well liked that the offi-
cial wives of the Sunan used to play with diminutive gold and jewel encrusted
wayang figures as a pastime." During an earlier period, when the Mataram rul-
ers had been allowed to mint their own money, wayang gidbog (shadow puppets of
the Panji cycle) and wayeng £lizhik figures had even appeared on their coinage."

Wayang was not only popular at the courts. In the countryside too, perfor-
mances were extremely well frequented: areas like. Kedhu and Ledhok were
renowned for their shadow plays and the European administration derived a substan-
tial income from the taxes paid on wayang performances in government controlled
provinces." In the Batavia-Bogor region, for example, wayang wong troupes were
allowed to tour the countryside playing in local pasers and throughout Java perfor-
mers and dbalangs wandered from village to village giving wayang shows." The lat-
ter, together with the satria Rlana (wandering noblemen), caused the Dutch
authorities particular concern during periods of agrarian unrest, for they often
emerged as local leaders.®® The tales which they performed of adventurers who had
raised themselves to princely status fired the imagination of the rural population,
especially the numpangs (unmarried landless labourers), who earned a marginal exis-
tence as porters on the roads or as unofficial bodyguards of prominent courtiers.""
The great popularity of wayang at this time can be seen too in the number of proper
names and toponyms which were characters and places in the wayang."" At
the same time, the use of Javanese orchestras which were played as an
accompaniment to wayang performances, was also widespread. During the Java War,
many chiefs who rallied to Dipanagara brought their own orchestras with them and
select instruments, in particular the small cymbals (bénahe), drums (&embur) and
gongs, were used during battle engagements to strengthen the morale of their
troops.5® A beautiful example of this mixture of music, dance and the martial ares
can be found in a European eye-witness description of Dipanagara during his flight
from Tégalréja. This mentioned that the prince, who was dressed completely in

white and was mounted on a prancing horse, looked as though he was dancing
(randhak) in the midst of his lance bearing bodyguard."

Although the wayang imagery used in the babad was primarily included to
heighten the dramatic effect of many of the scenes, it also provides the main clue to
the author's assessment of Dipanagara's character. Thus his choice of the wayang
figure, Raden Samba, with whom to equate the prince, highlights his two main critic-
isms of Dipanagara: first the latter's close associations with the religious com-
munities, and secondly the flaws in his character deriving from personal ambition

XXI

Babad Dipanagara

(pamrib). As he is portrayed in the Javanese shadow theatre, Samba is on the one
hand a quintessentially courtly figure who would be out of place in the company of
rural sentris, and, on the other hand, he is a satria (knight) without any spiritual
power (Rasékten). A handsome figure and a fine talker with a good eye for women,
Samba is nevertheless a devious and shallow character in the shadow theatre. On
one occasion in the wayang tales, he is able to acquire spiritual power by virtue of a
magical tattoo on his hand given to him by a pandbite (sage). As long as the efficacy
of this tattoo lasts, Samba enjoys a period of real power and is able to conquer
hitherto invincible r2ksasas (demons). But his glory is short lived. When the magical
tattoo wears off, Samba returns to being his normal self again and his power is at an
end.®" By comparing Dipanagara with Samba, the author has therefore clearly indi-
cated his view of the prince's character and his chances against the Dutch. According
to him, Dipanagara would prevail for a while through the potency of the magic arts
such as the powers of invulnerability bestowed on his troops (VIII. 15). But, as with
Samba, his period of fame would be of short duration. His borrowed Aasééter would
eventually loose its efficacy and he would become an ordinary person again, no
longer of any consequence against the Dutch

Much the same attitude towards Dipanagara can be seen in Cakranagara's Bur,
where Dipanagara is likened to Suyudana, head of.the Kurawas, a great ruler and a
fine warrior, yet fated to destroy himself and his house because of his overweening
vanity. In the same text, the author made it clear that, in his opinion, it was not the
right time (during miangse) to drive the Dutch from Java and thar Dipanagara's
efforts were doomed to failure on account of his personal ambition (Pamrib): a view
which is still generally held today in Surakarta court circles.©" Needless to say the
wayang figures which appear in Dipanagara's own autobiographical babad are very
different, and it seems that he consciously modelled himself on Arjuna, the third of
the five Pandbawa brothers, who is renowned in the wayang for his physical beauty
and great spiritual strength."

Just as the example of Samba was chosen by the babad writer to indicate his
view of the prince's character, so the figure was also picked to stress Dipanagara's
courtly origins and the incongruity of his connections with the santris. The author
has thus taken pains to portray the'prince environment. At the start of
the babad, he is shown to live amongst his retainers at Tegalréja and Stlarong in a
style appropriate to his rank (I. 16-17) and after the skirmish with Danuréja's men
outside his residence, he is portrayed distributing largesse in a manner which would
have been expected of a nobleman (IV. 1-5). All these descriptions build up to the
magnificent picture of Dipanagara before the fight with the Dutch at Téegalrcja, when
he is compared directly with Samba (VIII 21). Shaded by a state umbrella (Gayung)
and mounted on a superbly caparisoned horse, the prince is shown to ake litle
direct part in the fighting apart from his brief (and probably fictitious) hand-to-hand
conflict with Wiranagara (IX. 19-25). Such an aloof position would again have been
suitable for a person of high noble birth.©* Furthermore, the babad writer found no
difficulty in reconciling setnia (knightly) and saniri (religious) values by describing
Dipanagara both as being dressed in the white raiments of the Holy War (Prang
sabil) and as having his symbol of princely authority, his payng, held over his head
(VIII. 16, 21). The author even went so far as to qualify the latter as a symbol of
the Holy War (X. 28), a remark which underlined the highly syncretic kraton
approach to Islam in general.*

The emphasis in the babad on Dipanagara as a Javanese aristocrat had the pur-
XXH

Introduction

pose of making his associations with the religious communities seem all the more
incongruous. Thus the phrase which the babad writer put into the mouth of Resi-
dent Smissaert undoubtedly sums up the highly critical attitude of many members of
the Javanese courts towards the prince's sen/ri connections:

$0»

It is a sham, his giving himself over to religion

9. and often going away to perform asceticism.
He is hand in glove with the santris.
He has given up the sense of honour of the safrias,
for he has accepted the sense of honour of the santris.

10..

He mixes with the scum of the nation
(and) is arrogant enough to invite battle,
but these sentriz, what do they amount to?**

In the view of the babad writer and of numerous others in the Central Javanese
kratons, Dipanagara had not been loyal to his caste. He had thrown over his obliga-
tions as a Javanese nobleman and had demeaned himself by associating with the «an-
tris, most of whom were drawn from a rural background and had a very different
social status from the courtly elite; The same attitude towards Dipanagara can be seen
in Cakranagara's Bzkw,®" and even aristocrats who fought for the prince, such as Ali
Basah Prawiradirja (Sentot), maintained a critical view of the religious leaders who
served under Dipanagara, Sentot's viewpoint was later epitomised by Dipanagara
when he remarked that the young nobleman could 'neither read nor write and from
his earliest childhood bad shown a violent dislike for Dipanagara's intention to edu-
cate him for the position of a 'priest' (sic)."*" Indeed, Dipanagara and his family were
to some extent unique amongst their kraton contemporaries a this time because of
the depth of their, devotion to Islam and their numerous links with leading religious
teachers and mystics."" We shall see below (pt. IX) how this situation can be traced
to Dipanagara's rather unusual upbringing at Tégalr&ja, some distance away from the
Yogya court. Many of Dipanagara's santri associates later rallied to him at the start
of the Java War (V. 1-15) and they were of considerable use in organising a follow-
ing for Dipanagara at the village level. But their support eventually proved a liability
to him. Irreconcilable tensions developed between the prince's kraton and santr/
supporters over questions of landholdings, military tactics, the treatment of prison-
ers and the role of religion in areas controlled by Dipanagara."" These difficulties,
which effectively split Dipanagara's followers, hastened the prince's defeat at the
hands of the Dutch, especially after Kyai Maja's defection in November 1828. The
comments in this babad thus afford a useful insight into the deep-seated suspicion of
the religious communities in Javanese court circles and the impossibility of any last-
ing alliance between the two groups.

Besides his attack on Dipanagara's relationship with the religious communities,
the author also contrived to introduce a histrionic note into his portrayal of
Dipanagara as an aristocrat turned religious leader. In various passages it seems that,
with conscious irony, he was casting the Yogya prince in the role of a latter-day
Prophet Muhammad. Thus Dipanagara's insistence that he wished to be driven away
from the capital (Yogyakarta) and his demands of pledges of loyalty from his follow-
ers (I. 18-19), read as a burlesque of the Prophet's famous hijrab (flight) of the
year 622 from Mecca to Medina. The same is true of the prince's decision to
embark on the Holy War (preng sabif) against the Europeans and the Chinese in

XXI

Babed Dipanagara

Java, which he is depicted as announcing in high-flown rhetoric (V. 1-6) and which
seemed to emulate Mubammad's own declaration of the #ibad on the unbelievers in
Mecca."" The historical example of the great Prophet of Islam may have been used
by the babad writer to offset what he viewed as absurdly histrionic gestures of
Dipanagara's part and to attack yet again the pretensions of the santri.

Finally, it should be noted that the viewpoint of the author is throughout that
of a Surakarta official and his attitude towards Yogyakarta is coloured by the long
standing rivalry between the two courts. Thus, the author has incorporated various
small illusions into his text to highlight the fact that, in his estimation, Surakarta was
the senior court in Central Java and took precedence over Yogyakarta. During the
discussions in the babad about road building projects in the nagare agung, for exam-
ple, Surakarta is referred to pointedly as a nagar? (state) as opposed to Yogyakarta
which is dismissed as a mere Autha (town) (VI. 6). In the same scene, Danuréja, the
Yogya Patih, is also made to allude to his Surakarta colleague as Kang Mas Adipatys
(my elder brother the Adipati), another recognition of Surakarta seniority (VI. 20-
21). Meanwhile, Danuréja's initiative in the matter of road construction is shown by
the babad writer to have been grounded on an incorrect understanding of previous
adat (custom) (VI. 4-7), so once again Yogyakarta is made to appear at a disadvan-
tage.

In conclusion, the author's attitude in the babad with regard to Dipanagara,
Yogyakarta and the Dutch can be characterised as a highly critical one. Although he
evinced some sympathy for Dipanagara's stand against the European government,
this sympathy was tempered by an unequivocal disapproval of the prince's san/r/ con-
nections and a censorious view of the prince's own character. Above all, he ques-
tioned Dipanagara's personal motives, and, by comparing him with Samba, predicted
his ultimate defeat at the hands of the Dutch. The author's account is thus steeped in
the prejudices and assumptions of a member of the Surakarta court, a viewpoint which
can be seen most clearly in his treatment of the religious communities and his dispar-
agement of Yogyakarta. This critical approach, combined with the highly contempor-
ary nature and historical accuracy: of the babad, makes it an invaluable source for
students of this period. In particular; it is a useful text to set beside Dipanagara's own
autobiographical babad, which gives his personal justification for his actions; the
Yogyakarta kraton chronicle, which espouses the viewpoint of the Sultan's court, and
the Buku Kidhung Keto, which was written under the aegis of one of Dipanagara's
most formidable provincial adversaries: Cakranagara 1 of Purwaréja. The existence of
these four Javanese chronicle traditions concerning Dipanagara and the Java War,
provides historians with a unique opportunity to produce a balanced appraisal of the
historiography of the period.

V. THE OTHER JAVANESE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS

V.A. Dipanagara's Autobiographical Chronicle: Babad Dipanagara

The most important of the four main chronicle traditions is that which was written
under Dipanagara's orders in Menado during the first part of his exile in Sulawesi
(1830-33). According to the dates given in the text, his account, usually known as
the Babad Dipanegara, was composed in just under nine months (8 Besar, A.J. 1758
- 1 Ramélan, A.J. 1759; 20 May 1831 - 3 February 1832)."" In slightly over
1,000 folio sized pages, it covers the history of Java from the fall of Majapahit
(c. 1527) to the peace of Giyanti (1755) (one third of the work), and the period of

XXIV

Introduction

Dipanagara's own life and times from his birth in 1785 down to his exile in Menado
in 1830. No original manuscript of this babad is now extant, but in the 1870's the
Dutch scholar, A.B. Cohen Stuart, made a series of copies of the manuscript owned
by Dipanagara's descendants who were living in Makasar." This family manuscript
may well have been the original, as it was written in pegon (Javanese written in
unvocalised Arabic letters), a script which was widely used amongst the more self-
consciously religious circles in Java and by Dipanagara himself."" But there is no
means of checking its authenticity as it has now apparently been lost. "5 The first
copy made by Cohen Stuart, also in Prgor script, and various other copies in Javanese
script are, however, in the library of the Museum Pusat in Jakarta. Unfortunately the
pegon copy, which is probably the most accurate for purposes of historical research,
has been allowed to deteriorate so badly that many pages are now illegible and its
use for students is at present limited." The copy which is referred to in the present
study is one in Javanese script which is now in the Leiden University Library and
classified as LOr 6547 a-d. This four volume quarto transcription of the Bubad
Dipanagara is from the collection of the late Professor G.A.J. Hazeu and closely
resembles one of the copies in Javanese script in the Museum Pusat collection. The
text of the Rusche edition of the last two thirds of Dipanagara's babad, first printed

in Surakarta in 1908-1909, also seems to have been based on a similar manu-
script.""

According to Dipanagata, the idea of writing such an autobiographical account
was first suggested to him by the Resident of Menado, D.F.W. Pietermast (1826-
1832), who had asked him about the reasons for his exile. The prince undertook to
write the history of his life and times after he had made the Resident promise that
he would deliver a letter to King William I of the Netherlands (1813-40) request-
ing permission for him to make the pilgrimage to Mecca (b4;)."* Despite this intrigu-
ing insight into the genesis of Dipanagara's babad, the which it was actu-
ally written down is still unclear. It is unlikely that Dipanagara himself was respon-
sible for drawing up the work, for, although he was a fascinating talker, he wrote
Javanese very badly.?" Moreover, the only surviving manuscripts from his hand are
in prose and not in Javanese fembang (verse)."" Instead, it is possible that Dipanagara
may have sketched the outlines of his chronicle orally or in prose and then left it to
an amanuensis to convert into Yemhang. This seems to have been the technique
which was used later by Cakranagara when he wrote the Buku Kédbung Kébo in the
1840's and many other contemporary Javanese babads were composed in a similar
fashion at this time." Dipanagara had with him in his entourage in Menado one of
his brothers-in-law named Tumenggung Dipawiyana, who apparently wrote Javanese
fluently in both pegon and Javanese script, and later (Aug. 1830) a scribe was sent from
Tondano to help the prince. So either of these two men might have been in a position to
cast Dipanagara's babad in rembang and compose the final version.** But there is nothing
in the Dutch sources to confirm this and the Resident of Menado made no mention in his
official letters of any literary activities on Dipanagara's part.*

Although there is very little firm information about the background to the
composition of Dipanagara's autobiography, its importance as an historical source
has long been recognised. The Dutch military historian, P.J.F. Louw, who drew on
the babad extensively for his history of the Java War, wrote that 'unhesitatingly we
would attribute such a high historical value to the babad of Dipanagara, that any
history of the Java War could undoubtedly be branded as highly incomplete if it had

XXV

Babad Dipanagara

not used the babad as a source'.®* Louw made use of Dutch and Malay translations of
the original manuscript which are often faulty®3, and his main interest in the babad
was in order to check the details of military engagements, in which field the account
is the least accurate of all. But, even after detailed comparison with the available
Dutch military reports, Louw still accorded the babad his highest praise: 'his
(Dipanagara's) account is as far as we can judge an ingenuous one and can on most
points not only ... sustain the control of European sources but ... it gives more than
these!." It is the opinion of the present writer that the babad is most useful for
checking the details concerning the history of Yogyakarta before the Java War and
Dipanagara's own activities in Téegalréja. Louw's historical appraisal of the work is
therefore amply justified for this period and perhaps also for Dipanagara's view of
events during the Java War itself. It cannot, however, in any sense be designated an
'ingenuous' source, for Dipanagara's prejudices and assumptions are clearly marked
in the babad. In the political alignments in the Yogyakarta kraton, for example,
Dipanagara supported his father (the future Sultan Haméngkubuwana III) against
the party of Pangeran Natakusuma (later Paku Alam 1) and even against the follow-
ers of the second Sultan. The account thus reflects Dipanagara's highly personal and
partisan view of the Sultan's.court.

V.B. Cakranagara's Family Chronicle: Buku Kedhung Kébo

The second most important group of Javanese accounts about the period of
Dipanagara, which are sometimes referred to loosely as. Babad Dipanagera, are the
various recensions of the Buku Kédhung Kebo (chronicle :of Kedhung Kebo').
Kedhung Kébo (buffaloes watering hole") was the picturesque local name for the
settlement on the Bagawanta river (Bagélen) which was later known by the more
dignified toponym Purwaréja ('the beginning of prosperity). The original manuscript
of the Buku was written under the orders of Raden Adipati Cakranagara I (1830-
62), the first Bupati of Purwareja after the Dutch annexation of the area in 1830."
Cakranagara came from a family of prominent Kyais (country gentlemen) in the
Bagélen area and served for a time as Mantri gladhag, an official in charge of the
porters guild, in Surakatta before the outbreak .of the Java War, His name at this
time was Mas Ngabehi Resadiwirya and the first mention of him in the sources is in
1810, when, as a priyey Aepatiban (an official of the. Patih's office in Surakarca), he
was sent to Ampel near Bayalali to investigate an irrigation question.®* It is unlikely
that he knew Dipanagara before the Java War, although there is an unsubstantiated
oral account that the two men studied Aébetiner (Javanese spiritual disciplines)
together under the same gure (teacher) just outside Surakarta."" During the war
itself, Cakranagara was ordered to return to Bagélen with a detachment of Surakarta
troops. His duties there were initially those of a guide to the local Dutch comman-
der, Colonel J.B. Cleerens, but he later made himself useful in military matters as
well and in 1829 he replaced his Surakarta superior, Pangeran Kusumayuda. His
exploits in the fighting against Dipanagara's forces in the area earned him the posi-
tion of provincial head (Bupati) of the newly created Aebupaten (administrative area)
of Purwaréja at the end of the war. In many ways he was typical of the 'new men',
mostly provincial gentry, who were favoured by the Dutch in 1830 over the heads
of the old court grandees like Pangeran Kusumayuda who had hitherto administered
the outlying areas in the name of the Central Javanese rulers. As a 'new man', Cak-
ranagara felt the need to justify his rapid rise to prominence, so, amongst other things
(like the building of an impressive residence), he commissioned the B& to illustrate his
career in the service of the Sunan and the Dutch. The account of his life and times was

XXVI

Introduction

also designed to serve as a foundation charter for his family, four of whom succeeded him
as Bupatis in Purwar¥ja."" Most of the work concerns his activities in Bagélen during the
Java War and the history of the Purwaréja Kabupaten after 1830 (until c. 1840),
but nine introductory cantos are included which deal with Dipanagara and the
events in Yogyakarta between 1812 and 1825. As a piece of literature the is
mot fine, since it is written in coarse provincial Javanese and incorporates many
Malay words and idioms, which are used especially in the conversations between
Dutch and Javanese officials depicted in the text. It cannot thus be compared in
terms of literary style with the polished cadences of the kraton babads or even with
the dignified simplicity of Dipanagara's autobiographical chronicle.

Cakranagara's position as an official of the Surakarta Aipatiben in the years
before the Java War, meant that he probably had access to a considerable amount of
information concerning political developments in Yogyakarta during the 1812-25
period. His colourful account of the fighting in the early weeks of the war, when he
himself was still in the Sunan's capital, could likewise have been based on the
reports which came back to Surakarta from the members of the Sunan's forces who
served in Yogyakarta (see above pt. TV). But the Bwéz's insights into Dipanagara's
character and motives are so detailed, that there is some doubt about how much
Cakranagara himself contributed to the early passages concerning the prince and his
circle at Apart from the tenuous oral tradition of a contact with
Dipanagara, there is no other evidence to suggest that Cakranagara had any direct
knowledge of the latter's life in Yogyakarta before the war. By a close comparative
study of the introductions to the various manuscripts, however, it is possible to con-
clude that another author may have had a hand in the composition of the early can-
tos. This second author has been identified as Ali Bassh Peng«lasan, a junior kraton
official of the Sultanate prior to 1825, who later became a prominent army com-
mander (Beseb) of Dipanagara during the war. He appears to -have been an intimate
associate of the prince and was placed in charge of one of his elite bodyguard regi-
ments which was recruited largely from sentris. It seems certain that Péengalasan was
in a position to acquire close personal knowledge about Dipanagara and his circle of
advisers both before and duting the Java War. There is a strong possibility that he
supplied Cakranagara with most of the details for the early cantos, whereas Cak-
ranagara himself provided the-material for the second part of the Bwé which con-
cerns the campaigns in Bagélen. The work thus represents an interesting example of
co-operation between a bitter enemy of Dipanagara (Cakranagara), and a warm sup-
porter and confidant of the prince (Pengalasan).""

The earliest available manuscript of the Buku is LOr 2163 of the Leiden Uni-
versity Library which was completed in 1842-3."" A Dutch translation of the intro-
ductory cantos which deal with the background to the war and the outbreak of
Dipinagara's rebellion has already been referred to (see above pt. I and note 17).
This was published as long ago as 1860, but it cannot be regarded as anything more
than a general summary of the text. Moreover, since the publication did not include
a text edition of the original MS. (LOr 2163), its use as an historical source is
limited. For the purposes of the present study, the original Leiden manuscript has
been used in conjunction with another manuscript copy of the Bake from the col-
lection of the Koninklijk Instituut (Leiden). This MS., classified as KITLV Or. 13,
has recently been the subject of an unpublished M.A. Thesis. The latcer gives a full
transliteration of the first nine cantos and a summary in English which greatly facili-
tates the historian's task."" Although the Koninklijk Instituut version dates from

XXVI

Babad Dipanagara

1866, the differences with LOr 2163 are very slight and both manuscripts can be
used together as comparative accounts.

V.C. The Yogyakarta Court Chronicles concerning Dipanagara: Babad Ngayogyakarta

The third main group of babads concerning the life and times of Dipanagara are
those which were written at the Yogyakarta court in the late nineteenth century. In
terms of historical importance, these should probably be placed in fourth place after
Dipanagara's autobiographical babad, the Bbw and the Surakarta kraton version
edited in the present study, since they are the least contemporary. But they
nevertheless contain a considerable amount of information and give a unique
account of events from the point of view of the Yogya court. Various manuscript
copies of this Yogyakarta chronicle tradition still survive. One can be found in the
Widyabudaya manuscript collection of the Yogya kraton classified as Widyabudaya
A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran), which appears to be a copy made in 1906." There are
also other manuscript copies in the Sana Budaya Museum Library (Yogyakarta),
entered as SB A. 135 (Babed Ngayogyaharta, vol. 1), SB A. 136 (Babad
Neayogyakarta, vol. 11) and SB A. 144 (Babad Ngayogyakarte, vol. II), which cover
the period from the accession of the second Sultan (April 1792) to the appointment
of Raden Adipati Danuréja Vin February 1847.9 As these latter manuscripts were
more readily available to the present writer than that in the Yogyakarta court collec-
tion, they have been used here, although a few references have been made to the
Widyabudaya text for purposes of comparison.

The principal author of the Babsd Ngayogyakarta was Pangeran Suryanagara, a
son of Sultan Haméngkubuwana IV (1814-22) by the daughter of a court abalang,
Kyai Dhalang Jiwaténaya, who was the leading wayeng £ulif puppeteer of his time in
Yogyakarta."" Perhaps Suryanagara inherited some of his grandfather's artistic skills,
for he later became a well-known court poet (pujangga dalem) in Yogyakarta and
won a government gold medal in 1875 for Javanese literature."" He married into the
Paku Alam family and maintained close contacts with Dutch military and scientific
circles in Jakarta, being himself an honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the Dutch Gen-
eral Staff and a corresponding member of the Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap
(Royal Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences). Suryanagara helped to develop a
distinct Yogyakarta literary style, which used a literary idiom containing many hewi
(Old Javanese) words unknown in Surakarta texts."" His main interest was in the
history of the Yogya courts (the Sultanate and Paku Alaman) and he also acquired a
reputation for expertise in constructing chronogram lists (babed although
the latter has been called into question by a recent study of séngka/a texts.'"" The
unique feature of Suryanagara's Babed Ngeyegyakarta volumes is that they include
transcripts of official Dutch and Javanese letters from the period of the Java War
some of which were taken from J. Hageman's history published in 1856."
Suryanagara's work thus reflects a combination, which was extremely rare in Java-
nese literary compositions, in that it was based on both European and Javanese sources.

Suryanagara was helped in writing the final volume, which covers the period
from 1826 to 1847, by Danuréja V, Patih of Yogyakarta (1847-79), who drew on
his own experiences of the Java War period to amplify the former's researches.
Danuréja V, who was then known as Ali Basah Mahmud Gandakusuma, served
Dipanagara throughout the war as one of his most trusted army commanders and
remained loyal to him to the end. Thus, as was the case with PEngalasan and Cak-

XXVII

Introduction

ranagare, Danurgja was in a position to offer his co-author many personal insights
into Dipanagara's behaviour during the war which enhance the human quality of
Suryanagara's work. Similarly, for the first volume of the trilogy, dealing with the
years 1792-1816, Suryanagara appears to have had access to interesting private
sources in the library of the Paku Alaman. Indeed, this first volume bears a very
close resemblance to the prose version of the babad attributed to Paku Alam I,
known as the Babad Batawi, which was later used by C. Poensen for his study of the
reign of Sultan Haméengkubuwana 11.'* This latter babad mainly concerns the
events in Yogyakarta before the appointment of Paku Alam I in March 1813, and is
written from a highly partisan viewpoint. By virtue of his marriage into the Paku
Alam family, it is likely that Suryanagara was able to use an original manuscript
Aston) of Paku Alam's chronicle which he recast in a more flowery literary idiom.
Suryanagara's babad in turn, probably served as the source for the prose version

used by Poensen, which represents a much later recension of the Paku Alam
account.

Apart from the insights provided by Danurja V and the biases taken over from
the Paku Alam babad, the main theme which runs through Suryanagara's Babed
Neayogyakarta is that of the survival and continuation of the Sultan's court through a
troubled period of war and rebellion. The events which led up to the Java War are
dealt with scrupulously, but much stress is laid on specifically -kraton events such as
marriages, deaths, court ceremonies, the visits of Dutch dignitaries and the like. It is
perhaps in the context of these happenings at the Yogyakarta kraton, that the his-
torian can find new light to shed on the figure of Dipanagara, for he is seen not as a
central actor scheming a revolt as in the Bw&w or the present Surakatra text, nor as
an incorruptible paragon as in the autobiography, but rather as just one of the many
Pangerans at the Yogyakarta court at this time. Thus he is glimpsed as a rather dour
figure reading the Aitabs (Islamic texts) at the Friday services (salas Jumawab) in the
Great Mosque (Mésjid Agéng) of Yogyakarta, as a senior prince riding out to meet
Governor-General Van der Capellen at Karangiati in 1819, and as a member of the
Yogyakarta expedition sent out to help crush Pangeran Dipasana's revolt in Febru-
ary 1822!" No really new facts are given about the causes of the Java War, but
Suryanagara's babad is particularly strong on thevevents which shook the Yogya
court at the time: the troubles:-over the ending of the land rent in May 1823, the
influence of wandering dbukuns (mystics; magicians) and the quarrel over a kraton
pusaka (regalia).)°" Throughout the babad, the reader has the impression that he is
firmly based in Yogyakarta and that, although Dipanagara is often mentioned, the
events at Tégalréja and the fighting which followed are explained from the view-
point of the Sultan's court. The Babad Ngayogakarta is therefore a most useful foil
to the other Javanese historical accounts.

V.D. 'The Minor Javanese Accounts
V.D.1 The Chronicle of the Seizure of Yogyakarta: Babad Bidhah ing Ngayozyakarta

Prominent amongst the minor Javanese accounts, which do not fall into the category
of the Dipanagara babads and which have been referred to in the present study, is
the Babad Bidhah ing Ngayogyaharta (the chronicle of the seizure of Yogyakarta).
This babad recounts the events surrounding the attack on the Yogyakarta kraton by
the British on 19-20 June 1812 and affairs in the Sultanate up to May 1816, when
the young ruler, Sultan Haméngkubuwana IV, married a daughter of Danuréja II.
The original draft of this babad, which bears the title Serat Babad Ngengreng aping

XXIX

Babed Dipanagara

kelib (lit.; 'second draft of the chronicle") forms part of the John Crawfurd collection
in the British Library (London) and is written on Alvwang (Javanese treebark paper).
It seems likely that this unfinished draft was taken back to England by Crawfurd
when he left Java in October 1816 after the restoration of Dutch authority on the
island.!" A copy of the British Library manuscript is in the Leiden University Li-
brary classified LOr 2045. Although the latter represents a more polished version of
the text, it has been bowdlerised and is incomplete, so all references in the present
study will be to the draft in the British Library.'""

The author of the babad is not mentioned in the text, but it seems to have been
written at the behest of Pangeran Panular, an uncle of Sultan Haméngkubuwana III
(1812-14). Panular, who features prominently in the babad, was a staunch suppor-
ter of the third Sultan and a leading figure in the kerajar or kanoman party at court.
This party, which was made up of those Yogya Pargerans and officials who adhered
to the cause of Haméngkubuwana III and his son, Haméngkubuwana IV, was
opposed to the followers of the banished second Sultan, who were known as the
kastpuhan party (the partisans of the old Sultan (Sultan S&puh). The chronicle
strongly represents the views of the former group and thus affords an insight into
the party rivalries which were to bedevil-court politics in Yogyakarta until the
1850's.'"* Like Suryanagara's Babad Ngayogpakarta, the Babad Bidhab is very much a
court text which, deals in detail with minor kraton events and ceremonies. Dipana-
gara is often mentioned as a young prince closely associated with his father, the third
Sultan, and the babad provides an interesting background against which to assess his
activides during this period. Of particular use, as far as historians are concerned, is
the fact that many of the opening verses of the cantos are dated, and that the cantos
themselves bear the impression of having been written up at different stages
throughout the reign of the third Sultan and the beginning of that of his successor.
These dates range from 7 Jumadilakir A.J. 1739 (19 June 1812) to 15 Jumadilakir
A.J. 1743 (12 May 1816). Although the manuscript begins and ends abruptly, it has
something of the nature of a court diary and can be said to constitute a highly con-
temporaneous source for the history of developments in Yogyakarta during a crucial
period before the Java War.

V.D.2 Dipanagara's Makasar Notebooks: Sjarah Ratu Tanah Jawa and Hikayat Tanah
Jawa
Another important minor source for this period are the notebooks on Javanese his-
tory, legends and Islam which were written by Pangeran Dipanagara in Makasar and
which are now owned by his descendants.""" The notebooks are in pegor script and
written on Netherlands-Indies government paper cut into small octavo sized sheets
probably for economy. The first of these bears the date 5 Dulkijah A.J. 1765 (24
January 1838) and it is likely that both were written or dictated by Dipanagara
about the same time.''" This was a period when Dipanagara was placed in rather
strict confinement in Fort Rotterdam (now Benteng Ujung Pandang) in Makasar

because of the contents of some of his letters to Java. But he was still allowed to
have writing materials and books.!

Both the notebooks are in prose and not fembeng (verse) and were composed in
a curious Javanese style with many Arabic words and phrases. They may have been
intended as reading material for Dipanagara's children born in exile, two of whom
were just reaching boyhood at that time.''" The first book (175 pages), entitled

Introduction

Sifarab Ratu Tanah Jawa (the history of the rulers of Java), deals with the history of
Java and Javanese legends from Adam to the fall of Majapahit (c. 1527) and the
coming of Islam. It thus appears to be a prelude to the historical survey at the
beginning of Dipanagara's autobiography. But, whereas the latter follows a strictly
chronological order, the first Makasar notebook is written in an anecdotal fashion
with many digressions on diverse topics such as the wayang, legendary heroes and
holy sites. It is as though Dipanagara had set down on paper a series of lengthy
conversations for the entertainment of his family.

The second book (245 pages), which bears the tile Hikayat Tanah Jawa
(chronicle of Java), is undated and incomplete. Some of its pages have also been
severely damaged by damp and insects. The introduction states explicitly that it was
composed by Dipanagara, who referred to himself by the title he adopted during the
Java War (Sultan Ngabdul Hamid Erucakra etc.).''* The contents largely concern
Dipanagara's disquisitions on Islam, his own religious experiences, S&f prayers used
by the Nagshbandiva and Shattariya mystical brotherhoods (rarekar) and various
meditation techniques. Diagrams (dzerab) for the arrangement of Arabic words and
breathing exercises during prayer are included as well as local Javanese ngelmw (mys-
tical traditions). The whole book is slightly reminiscent of a Javanese primbor (divin-
ing manual).

For the purposes of the present study, the books have only been referred to
occasionally for they contain few passages of immediate historical relevance. But
they nevertheless constitute an invaluable source, on a more general level, for an
understanding of Dipanagara's historical perspective and his religious outlook. As
regards the latter, despite an impressive display of quotations from the Qur'an,
Dipanagara appears as more of a typical Javanese mystic and Szf than as an
orthodox Muslim reformer."!* The use of abrérs (short prayers for the glorification
of Allah which are repeated -in ritual order) and the ofrat form of meditation"
assume considerable importance in Dipanagara's view." The second Makasar
notebook thus provides a rich collection of documentation for anyone wishing to
understand the context of Javanese Islam in the early nineteenth century.

V.E. Malay Language Sources: Jayadiningrat's 'Sketches on the Java War'

One of the few Malay sources for this period is the series of notes made by the
Bupati of Karang Anyar (Bagélen), Raden Adipati Jayadiningrac (1830-1863) in the
1850's. These notes were later entitled 'Sketches on the Java War' (Schersen over den
corlog van Java) by the Dutch historian, J. Hageman (1817-71) who added extensive
annotations to the text. The original manuscript is-in the Museum Pusat collection
in Jakarta and is classified as Malay (ML) MS. no. 97." It was completed on 2 Feb-
ruary 1857 and runs to 114 folio sized pages. The text is written in common Bazar
Malay (Pasar Maleis), the lingua france used by Europeans and Indonesians in the
nineteenth century, and has many Javanese expressions. The author, a son of the
Yogyakarta prince, Pangeran Murdaningrat (killed 1826), and a grandson of Sultan
Hamengkubuwana 11, took part in the Java War on the side of Dipanagara but
deserted him in 1829 and was appointed as Bupati of Karang Anyar by the Dutch
government in His account of the war is haphazard, but he gives a fascinat-
ing picture of the social and economic pressures in the princely territories before
the outbreak of the Java War.''® In particular, his figures on taxation and the exam-
ples of corruption by Chinese tax-farmers add a new dimension to the material

XXXI

Babad Dipanagara

available on this subject in the Dutch sources. Jayadiningrat's account appears to
have been prompted by Hageman, who travelled extensively in Central Java be-
tween 1842 and 1854 to collect material for his book on the Java War.''* According
to Louw'®, Jayadiningrat waited until the death of Danuréja IV in 1849 before writ-
ing his work because of his intensely bitter feelings against the Yogya Patih whose
actions had done to much, in his view, to precipitate the war. By the time
the work was complete, Dipanagara had also died in Makasar (8 January 1855), and
Jayadiningrat felt that he could express himself with less restraint. Despite its outspoken-
ness, however, Jayadiningrat's acount does represent a somewhat biased viewpoint and it
is severely marred by the vulgar Malay idiom used in the text.

V.F. Prophetical Literature: Texts concerning the Jayabaya Prophecies and Messianic
(Ratu Adil) Expectations

The prophecies of the legendary twelfth century King of Kedhiri, Prabu Jayabaya,
are of particular importance for the history of the Dipanagara period."" Chiliastic
hopes of a Ratu Adil (Just Ruler) who would arise after a period of moral decline,
have been prominent at various periods in Javanese history, but they seem to have
exercised a particular hold on the imagination of the Central Javanese population in
the years immediately preceding the Java War. There is evidence in most of the
babad sources and in some European accounts that Dipanagara and his contem-
poraries were aware of the Jayabaya prophecies as well as their relevance for the
troubled times in which they lived."" Dipanagara's assumption of the title Erucakre,
which is one of the names of the Rate Adi, at Selarong on 15 August 1825 (1 Sura,
Wawu, A.J. 1753) clearly indicates that he saw himself as fulfilling the role of the
Just King.'*? For the purposes of the present study various contemporary Javanese
accounts of the Jaynhayl prophecies have been selected to illustrate the extent of
popular messianic expectations before the Java War. The most important early
nineteenth century work dealing with the pra/lzmbang, as the prophecies were
known, is the Sérat Cabolang which was probably.completed in Surakarca in 1815."
There is also a fragment of @ babad in the collection of the Netherlands Bible So-
ciety (on loan to the Leiden University Library), classified as NBS no. 37, bearing
the title, Rériper: Babad Dipanagaran (lyrical chronicle concerning Dipanagara)
which discusses the relationship between the Jayabaya prophecies and the history of
the Dipanagara period.'*" The fragment bears the date A.J. 1742 (1814), which is
probably erroneous as it was in all likelihood written after the Java War as an ex pest
facte account. Finally, there are two commentaries on the prophecies and transla-
tions in Dutch and Malay which date from this period and were prepared for the in-
formation of Dutch officials and military officers.'"*

V.G. Javanese and Malay Letters

In order to round off this survey of the Javanese historical materials relating to the
Java War period, mention must be made of the few collections of Javanese letters
which have survived from these years and which have been referred to in the present
study. Some of Dipanagara's letters and orders written during the war are in the
H.M. de Kock private collection of the Algemeen Rijksarchief (The Hague). The
letters in this collection mainly constitute intercepted correspondence between
Dipanagara and his commanders, reports of Dutch spies, and official communica-
tions sent by Dipanagara and other leaders to De Kock. Most of these documents
are copies, but there are a few originals bearing the pegor seal of Dipanagara.'*" Va-
rious transcripts of Javanese letters referring to the prince can also be found in the

XXXI

Introduction

copies of Suryanagara's Babad Ngayegyakarta mentioned above (see pt. V.C.) They
are of doubtful originality, however, and it seems that Hageman, who was the
source of much of the correspondence used by Suryanagara, merely had access to
Durch copies of the Javanese originals for his published work.'" Other original
letters from this period can be found in portfolios LOr 2167 and LOr 2168 of the
Leiden University Library. These appear to have been collected by the missionary
scholar, J.F.C. Gericke, between 1827 and 1842 and some were later used by
Roorda for his published collection of Javanese letters and charters which appeared
in 1845.'"" Further publications of letters written by Dipanagara and his associates
were made by Louw, De Klerck and JJ. de Hollander.'®* Meanwhile, some of the
correspondence between members of the Javanese kratons at this time can be found
in the two Leiden portfolios and in the private secretarial archive of the Sunan in
the Surakarta kraton, known as the Sasana Wilapa.!*" These usually concern rather
dry official matters, but they sometimes provide information which is lacking in the
other Javanese accounts.

VI. THE EUROPEAN SOURCES

VLA. The Residency Letters

The sources in European languages (mainly Dutch and English) for this period are
extensive and provide detailed evidence which can be used to check the Javanese
accounts. The most important category of European language source materials are
the Residency letters and reports which -were sent back by the Residents in Central
Java to the colonial government in Jakarta.""" Although some of these letters have
been lost or destroyed, the Indonesian National Archives (Arsip Nasional) in Jakarta
contain reasonably complete collections of Residency correspondence from
Yogyakarta and Surakarca for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (up
to 1832) and for the Government of Java's Northeast coast until 1808." The
Yogyakarta Residency collection has been used most extensively for the purposes of
the present study. The only period for which this collection is slightly fragmentary is
for the five years of British rule in Java (1811-16), but this gap .can be covered by
additional sources in the India Office Library (London).'"* Furthermore, the Dutch
scholar of the principalities, G.P. 'Rouffaer, made.copious notes on the Residency
archives in Surakarta and Yogyakarem during his study tour in Central Java in
1888-1889 and these notes can be used to amplify the other sources.'"" Additional
letters and reports pertaining to the administrations of H.G. Nahuys van Burgst,
Resident of Yogyakarta (1816-22), and A.H. Smissaert, Resident of Yogyakarta
(1823-25) can also be found in the Leiden University Library and in the archive of
the Ministry of the Colonies in The Hague (Algemeen Rijksarchief).'"" Both these
collections contain documents which are not in the Jakarta archives. Of particular
importance for the history of the outbreak of the Java War in 1825 are the letters in
the H.M. de Kock private collection of the Rijksarchief. Amongst these papers, for
example, is most of the correspondence between the Residents in Central Java,
Governor-General Van der Capellen (1816-26) and General De Kock dealing with
developments in the area during the first crucial months of the war."?" These letters
have hitherto been little researched, for, although both Louw and De Klerck made
use of De Kock's official correspondence in the erstwhile archives of the Dutch
General Staff (KNIL) in Bandung for their history of the Java War, they did not

have access to De Kock's private papers which were only deposited in the Hague
archives in 1905."3®

Babed Dipanagara
VIB. Final Memoranda: Memorie van Overgave

The detailed reports on affairs and personalities in an administrative area drawn up
by an outgoing Resident for his successor, known under the general title of Memories
van Overgave (final administrative reports) also form a very useful source for the his-
tory of developments in Central Java in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
century. Four full-length Memories of Residents who served in Yogyakarta before
1808, J.M. van Rhijn (1786), W.H. van IJsseldijk (1798), J.G. van den Berg (1803)
and M. Waterloo (1808), are still extant in the Jakarta archives and in
The very rich private collection of Nicolaus Engelhard, Governor of Java's N.E.
coast (1801-1808), which is in the Rijksarchief, likewise contains some important
final memoranda which touch on the Central Javanese courts: namely the Memories
of J.F. van Reede tot de Parkeler (1801) and Engelhard (1808) on the N.E. coast,
and that of J.G. van den Berg (1806) on Surakarta.'" Additional copies of these
reports by the Semarang Governors, including that of P.G. van Overstraten (1796),
can be found in the archive of Java's Northeast coast (Java's Noord Oost Kust) in
Jakarta.'*" After 1808, probably onthe orders of Daendels, no further Memories
encompassing the same degree-of detail were drawn up, but both Pieter Engelhard
(Resident of Yogyakarta, February-November 1808/October 1810-November 1811)
and John Crawfurd (Resident of Yogyakarta, 1811-1813/1814/1816) made notes on
the Residency archives and left a succinct survey of prominent court personalities
for their successors,!" / After the restoration of Durch authority on Java in 1816, the
practice of writing detailed Memories was allowed. to lapse still further, but the
degree of expertise and knowledge of local conditions on 'the part of Dutch Resi-
dents in Central Java still remained reasonably accurate. This can be seen in the

prolific reports on the background of the Java War and the data on the Residencies
compiled in the

VIC. Diaries of Events in Yogyakarta, July-September: 1825

Two important diaries describing events in Yogyakarta after the outbreak of the
Java War have survived. The first was written by the Assistant-Resident of
Yogyakarta, P.F.H, Chevallier (died November 1825), and is entitled 'Dag-Register
van den Assistent-Resident van Djokjokarta inhoudende aanteekeningen nopens het
gebeurde van den 16 Julijtot'¢n met 5 Augustus\ 1825" (Diary of the Assistant-
Resident of Yogyakarta containing notes on the events from 16 July up to and
including 5 August 1825)'"* The second was drawn up by the Belgian landscape
artist and architect, A. A.J. Payen (1792-1853), who had travelled to Yogyakarta in
June 1825 to oversee building repairs to the Resident's house and had been
trapped in the Sultan's capital by the outbreak of the Java War and the subsequent
siege of the city by Dipanagara's troops (20 July-20 September 1825). This latter
account, which was composed in a curious French style with many Dutch and Flem-
ish expressions, is entitled simply 'Voyage 2 Djokja-Karta, 1825" (Journey to
Yogyakarta, 1825) and covers the period from 27 June to 29 September.""" Both
these diaries are of considerable help for the purposes of the present study, and the
day to day reports which they contain can be used to check the details in the babad.
They are also highly critical of the incompetence of the senior Dutch officials and
military officers in Yogyakarta at the time, especially the Resident, A.H. Smissaert,

whose actions did much to heighten the sense of disquiet and anxiety amongst the
European inhabitants.!"

Introduction

VLD. Reports on Dipanagara

Many of the sources cited above refer to Dipanagara in some detail, but certain
European language documents can be singled out in particular as providing an inti-
mate view of the prince. The most interesting of these is the journal of Second

VLE. Official Decisions of the Governor-General

Amongst the more important official sources available to historians are the decisions
of the Governor-General (bestuiter van den Gouverneur-Generaal) in Council (in read)
i.e. in the presence of the Council of the Indies, Read ran Indie) and out of Council
Suiten raad). The minutes of these decisions provide interesting information on
administration and policy during the years 1816-25. Full indexes (Rappers) are avail-
able in the archive of the Ministry of the Colonies (Rijksarchief) for the period
1819-25, when affairs concerning the principalities were listed under the twin head-
ings of onlusten (disturbances) and inlanders (natives)! There are also a handful of
secret decisions (gebeim besiuiten) of the Governor-General both in and out of Coun-
cil which concern crucial matters such as the appointment of new rulers and succes-
sion problems in the princely states.!** It should be noted that the same decisions
can be found in the archive of the Algemene Secretarie (General Secretariat of the
Governor-General) in the Arsip Nasional (Jakarta), and that these are more com-
plete than the records in the Hague since they contain extensive appendices (biz-
lagen). The latter usually consist of official correspondence or reports from Dutch
Residents and Javanese Bupatis which had served as the basis for a particular deci-
sion and which were not sent back to the Hague. They are a source of great interest
e oc j

For the earlier period of the British interregnum (1811-16), the collection of
Java Factory Records' in the India Office Library (London) contains the main deci-
sions taken by the government in Finally, for the Java War years, the
routine decisions of the Governor-General can be supplemented by the voluminous
materials in the Gebeim en Kabinets Archief (Secret and Cabinet Archive) of the
Ministry of the Colonies archive in the Hague. This comprises a complete collection
of political decisions taken by the Governor-General, together with other relevant
papers and reports, which were referred to the King and the Minister of the Col-
onies in the Netherlands. Dutch translations of Javanese letters and detailed
memoranda by junior officials can sometimes be found in the bundles.!"

VLF. The Published Sources

The published sources which deal with this period are scattered and incomplete.
Both M.L. van Deventer and P.H. van der Kemp made an attempt to continue the
sixteen volume De Jong and Van Deventer series up to 1820, but the documents
published by them are arranged haphazardly and afford a rather parchy overview of
the years after 1811.'%° Van der Kemp's publication of the letters of Mr. H.J. van
de Graaff, a leading adviser of Governor-General Van der Capellen, is an exception,
however, and gives a useful insight into the 1816-26 period."" During the Java
War years, the official government gazette, the Bataviasche (after January 1828,
Javasche) Courant published most of the main official war reports and these can be
used to amplify the descriptions of the campaigns given in Louw and De Klerck.'"®
Many of these official reports were later republished by Nahuys van Burgst in his
four volume collection of documents on the Java War, which is a crucial source for
the 1825-30 period."" There are few published Javanese sources of relevance for
the early nineteenth century. The Rusche edition of the Babad Dipanagara has
already been referred to above (see pt. V.A.). Another useful published source is
Soeripto's doctoral dissertation; Ontuikkdlingsgang der Vorstenlandsche Wetbocken
(Leiden, 1929), which provides much information on the progress 'of Javanese law
codification in Yogyakarta and Surakarta during these years. Other published
sources are listed in the bibliography.

VIL ORTHOGRAPHY AND TRANSLITERATION

The spelling of Javanese names and words in the present study follows the usage of
the early nineteenth century wherever possible. Quotations from Javanese sources
are spelt as in the original even when this involves forms which are no longer stan-
dard. Plurals of Javanese words have been formed by adding the English 's' or 'es'.
All Javanese terms appearing in the Introduction and the notes to the text have
been placed in italics except for those which have been used frequently such as
babad, kraton, wayang, Patih and, Bupati.. Explanations in English and Indonesian
Malay of the Javanese words can be found in the glossaries. The only significant
departure from the orthographic standards used»here is the name of the city of
Yogyakarta. The latter form corresponds with current usage. Ngayopukarta Adinin-
grat would be the correct formal style in early nineteenth century usage. But the
current spelling has been adopted here for the sake of simplicity.

The system of transliteration for modern Javanese follows the system proposed
by the Congress of the Lembaga Bahasa Nasional (National Language Institure) in
Yogyakarta in January 1973. Thus ## becomes c#, da becomes dbe, dja becomes ja,
ja becomes ye, nja becomes nye, ta becomes the, and only the pipet ) is indicated.
This system of transliteration provides for greater facility as far as publication is
concerned, although the use of abe and the raise problems with the aspirated aha
and the which are used in Old Javanese and Sanskrit. Nevertheless, as the above
system has now been officially adopted for Javanese language books and newspapers,
the present author has considered it better to follow current practice.

Quotations from other languages (Old Javanese, Sanskrit, Arabic) also follow

currently acceptable systems of transliteration. Malay passages and Javanese texts
written in pegon are transliterated according to the system for Javanese.

Introduction

Finally, as far as the text edition of the Javanese manuscript is concerned, cor-
sections to the Javanese and to the metre have been incorporated directly into the
sext and the form in the manuscript reproduced in the notes. Capital letters are

sarely used in the MS., but they have been added in the present transliteration
wherever applicable.

VIII THE DATING SYSTEMS

Three systems of dating are used in this study. The Javanese lunar era from 1633,
which is classified as the Javanese era (Anno Jerano: A.J.). The Islamic Anno Hijrae
A H.) beginning in 622, which was sometimes used at the courts and amongst the
religious communities, and finally the Christian era (A.D.). Whenever a date is given
without an indication of the era (A.H. or A.J.) readers can assume that it is a date
from the Christian calendar, A table of conversions from A.H., A.J. and A.D. can
be found in van Nederlandsch-Indié, vol. V (Supplement) (s-
Gravenhage, 1927), pp. 65-79 (sub: 'Tijdrekening!). It cannot be stressed too highly
that as the Javanese thought in terms of the Javanese era (A.J.), and some members
»f the more self-consciously Islamic communities (including Dipanagara) thought in
cerms of the Anno Hijre, these latter systems assume paramount importance for
the Javanese view of history.

IX. DIPANAGARA AND THE JAVA WAR: AN HISTORICAL SKETCH!®®

Although the immediate causes of the Java War are reasonably well known and are
dealt with in detail in the present babad, the long term economic and social origins
of the conflict have been hitherto ignored. These must be sought in the structure of
government and society in the princely states at the turn of the nineteenth century.
At that time the core regions of the principalities were economically prosperous, but
burdened with an uneven taxation system, poor administration and widespread ban-
diery. Foreign observers, who commented on: Javanése agrarian conditions were
most forcibly struck by the following interrelared phenomena: the rapidly burgeon-
ing population, the opening up of new ricefields the existence of a class of
large peasant proprietors (wong sip), the numerous landless labourers (numpangs),
the evidence of considerable local trade and the debilitaring effects of the apanage
organisations. "*

Accurate population statistics are not available for this region until the late
nineteenth century, but, on the basis of the number of crabs (households) recorded
in the late eightecath century land registers, it is possible to stipulate a minimum
annual population growth of around one per cent for the period 1755-1803. Dur-
ing these fifty years the population of the principalities grew from 905,000 to about
14 millions and accounted for over a third of the total number of inhabitants in
Java.'*" The increase in the core regions was probably much greater, however, for
there was a net outflow of population to the Dutch ruled pas/sir (north coast areas),
where the annual growth rate was of the order of five per cent.'** This outflow was
not accounted for in the land registers. The latter were also based on incomplete
information regarding the size of landholdings, which local officials and farmers con-
sistently under-estimared to the royal surveyors (@bdi/-dalem prikse dbusun) in order
to avoid taxation.'** Demographers have not paid much actention to this period, but

XXXVII

Babad Dipanagara

it is likely that the steady expansion during these years laid the foundation for Java's
demographic explosion in the nineteenth century when the population quadrupled
between 1830 and 1900.55

The reasons for the population growth in Central Java in the late eighteenth
century were fourfold. First, apart from isolated local disturbances, the area
enjoyed seventy years of unbroken peace between the time of the Giyanti treaty
(1755) and the outbreak of the Java War (1825). This was the first long period of
tranquillity in Java for many centuries. Secondly, there were no large scale epidem-
ics until cholera reached the island from India in the 1820's. The most serious
endemic disease at this time was small-pox, which caused particular depradations
amongst the young, hence its Javanese nickname Zara bocab (the children's ailment),
but which never reached epidemic proportions because of the scattered nature of
the population.'*® Thirdly, the rural inhabitants of Java married young: the men at
around sixteen and the women at between thirteen and fourteen. This was because
marriage had distinct financial advantages, Women were generally recognised as
being more dexterous than-men in money matters and they would usually make an
important contribution to the household budget by their marketing activities.!"
Children also played a vital role in the Javanese peasant economy. Most cultivators
would raise a family of between eight and ten children, half of whom would survive
into adolescence. These would usually start work ar the age of eight: the boys being
taught the rudiments of agriculture and the girls being given instructions in spinning
and weaving. The latter would also take part in the transplanting and harvesting of
Thus a large family was an advantage of a cultivator who had rights over
more land than he could. cultivate on his own account, Fourthly, the existence of
adequate food supplies and the balanced diet of families in rural areas created a suit-
able environment for demographic growth by increasing local resistance to disease.
European officials of the time commented on the generally healthy condition of the
peasantry, and, until the 1820's, most farmers were able to enjoy a mainly rice
diet."" It was only.in the years immediately preceding the Java War, that wide-
spread droughts and harvest failures occurred in-the principalities. These led to local
famines, forcing peasants to depend on less nutritious secondary crops such as
maize and. cassava, /as well, as 'wild tubers 'and» leaves, and it was precisely
during this period that the devastating cholera epidemics occurred. But in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth century such times of dearth were rare.'"°

The rapid opening up of new ricefields in Central Java and the construction of
extensive irrigation systems mirrored the steady demographic growth. In 1804, one
Dutch official reported that the increase in rice production was visible everywhere
in the central regions: 'one has only to direct one's eyes to the lands which now
produce rice', he wrote, 'and which twenty years ago were still waste and unculti-
vated'.'"" According to him, the amount of sawab in the area around Yogyakarta
had increased by 25% in ten years (1796-1806), much of this increase being due to
the construction of dams and irrigation ditches on the various estates owned by the
Yogya rulers.!"" These royal initiatives were paralleled in other regions by the exer-
tions of local farmers.'"" By 1836, nine tenths of the available agricultural land in
Mataram (the main province of Yogyakarta) was under cultivation, two thirds of
which was sawab.'"* There even appears to have been pressure on land in some
areas. In Kédhu, for example, Crawfurd noted in 1812 that greater use was being
made of dry crop fields in the poorly irrigated central plain and that mountain
tice (gogo) was being cultivated at ever higher reaches of the volcanic foothills sur-

Introduction

the province.'"" In the south of the region there was a report in 1824 that

lxcal farmers had ploughed up a main road and planted it in many places, so great
was the need for land. '"*

Apart from the rulers, who were viewed as the 'overlords' of all the territory in
she princely states, the main beneficiaries of this rapid extension of irrigated riceland
an Central Java were the small class of 'landowning' peasants known as the wong
«ep (lit: 'users of the land'). These were descendants of the original founding
Sumilies of a village who had a stake in the sawab owned in common by the com-
ssunity. The village heads (furab) and local tax collectors (Bik!) were usually drawn
Srom this group. They also bore the full weight of the land rent (ba/ég) and corvée
sequirements demanded by the rulers and the apanage holders (members of the Sul-
san's family and high officials), who were given usufruct of land in the central dis-
wncts. Below the s/kip were the ngindbungs, who owned their own house and yard
But had no share in the village ricefields, and the »«mpangs, unmarried strangers,
who lived in the compound of the sigip and performed agricultural and corvée ser-
wices for him.!" This latter group appro%iimated.most closely to a class of landless
pessants in Java at this time. Unlike the rig/indburgs, who could sometimes improve
their social position by marrying into sikep families, the numpangs had very little
chance of raising their status unless they left the village completely and opened up
sew lands elsewhere. But such opportunities were becoming increasingly rare after
1800. Some did try to break out of the cycle of rural servitude by taking employ-
ment as porters (batuss):6n the main trade routes or by entering the service of
influential noblemen at the courts, Others joined the numerous bands of robbers
and vagabonds who roamed the Javanese countryside: The majority, however,
remained in the villages where they were used by the "landowning! peasants for con-
structing new ricefields.""* These individually developed lands (anah yase) were the
mainstay of the s#kips' wealth, for, unlike the common village sawa or the other
heirloom lands' (arab handed down by the founding families, they were
akin to private property. Moreover, the tax burdens on these lands were often light
or non-existent until the early nineteenth century, for<the royal cadasters were sel-
dom revised to take account of changes in land use atthe village level (see
below.)?"

In many rural areas the skips seem to have exercised substantial local influence
by virtue of their extensive rights over land and their control over large numbers of
labourers. This situation was clearly recognised in Bagélen by a Dutch scholar who
commented on the quasi 'patron-client' system prevailing in the province before the
Java War."" Similarly in Kédhu, Crawfurd noted that each s#4p laboured the lands
which he had rented to his own advantage, shared very little property in common
and only gathered together in village associations to have some mutual security in an
insecure countryside. 'Cultivators who live next door to each other', he wrote, 'can
be as distant and unconnected as if they lived twenty miles apart'.'*" The support of
these 'independent' farmers was of great importance for Dipanagara during the Java
War. On the one hand, they supplied the taxes needed by the prince to prosecute
the war, and, on the other hand, their local influence over the numpangs ensured the
recruitment of soldiers and porters for Dipanagara's commanders. The control of the
rural population far more than the conquest of territory was thus the most crucial
issue during the Java War, just as it had always been throughout Javanese history.
Dipanagara appears to have recognised this at an early stage in the hostilities. In
1826, for example, a village official who had come over to the Dutch, reported that
Dipanagara appeared to be acting in a manner expected of a Javanese 'Just King!

(Ratu Adil). He had made promises everywhere in country areas that if he gained
victory he would only demand a maximum of four Spanish dollars on a fang of land,
regardless of whether the latter was 'fat or thin' (i.e. fertile or infertile).'*" The same
attempt to secure popular support can be seen in Dipanagara's instructions to
the provincial heads appointed by his commanders during the war. These prohibited
changes in the existing irrigation systems or demands for additional taxes and
instructed that any plundered goods should be returned to the owners on pain of
punishment.'"" The threats were sometimes enforced: in 1829, one of Séntot's off-
cials was flogged on Dipanagara's orders for demanding more taxes than he was
allowed."*" But, by this time, the prince's local following was already on the wane.
The Dutch system of small fortified outposts (Genferg stele), begun in 1826, which
guarded areas in the plains recently 'pacified' by Dutch troops, had started to have
an effect. Not only did they restrict the movement of Dipanagara's supporters, but
the rural population also appear to have left the areas nominally under the prince's
control to set up their pasars (markets) in thé safety of the bentergs. Thus the money
which Dipanagara's officials raised from the pasers, the market tax, which was their
principle source of revenue, steadily dwindled and there were less resources avail-
able for the war effort. '*" By the end of 1829 organised resistance to the Dutch in the
fertile rice plains of Central Java was effectively at an end. Only a few commanders
continued to hold out in the hills until Dipanagara's capture at Magélang on 28
March 1830, but without support from the rural communities their efforts were
doomed to failure:

Although some of Dipanagara's success as a leader in the early stages of the war
can be ascribed to his astute use of popular messianic hopes regarding the coming of
a 'Just Ruler', other factors facilitated his efforts. Prominent amongst these was
Dipanagara's own reputation as a careful administrator of his own lands in Yogya
before 1825 and his ability in getting on with the.common people.'"* As Willem
van Hogendorp pointed out:'*"

"A special characteristic about Dipanagara in the view of the Javanese, who are

always extremely 'exalted and distant in their dealings between superiors and

inferiors, is that he consorts as- easily -with the common man as with the great
ones and because of this he has made himself much loved everywhere."

This aptitude for mixing with all classes of Javanese society, which was a central part
of Dipanagara's personal charisma, can be traced back to his childhood and upbring-
ing at Tégalréja, his great-grandmother's estate just outside Yogyakarta.'*" Accord-
ing to the description in his babad, he lived there in the midst of a rice farming
community and associated freely with visiting rural senirés:!®®

moreover there were also farmers.

famous country Ky«# (religious teacher) from Sragen near Surakarta.!"" She appar-
ently delighted in farming and carrying out her religious duties.'"" Moreover, unlike
many members of the courtly elite, she did not eschew trade.!"" Towards the end of

XL

 

Introduction

her life, she became especially scathing of the pretensions of her son, the second
Sultan, whom she is supposed to have addressed in the following terms on her
deathbed (18 October 1803):!""
'Sultan! The path which I have to lay aside is difficult, and now I feel that I am
no more than the ordinary people. My son, be conscious of that and do not
believe that after your death you are anything more than a common coolie
(betur). So live accordingly!"
Dipanagara thus grew up under the guidance of a remarkable lady and in a unique
environment which brought him into contact with a wide range of different people.
He was also personally endowed with the qualities of leadership: in Knoerle's
words, 'the Pangeran .... appeared as a noble (and) ... proud man, gifted with intelli-
gence, a strongly enterprising character and a penetrating judgement, such as is rarely
found amongst high placed Javanese. These impressions were echoed by many
other Europeans with whom Dipanagara came into contact.'?*

Quite apart from Dipanagara's personal attributes as a leader, the existence
of widespread rural discontent on the eve of the Java, War, made it much easier for
him to appeal for popular support. Responsibility for-creating this agrarian unrest
was due as much to the actions of the Central Javanese rulers themselves as to the
demands of the European administrations after 1808. Jo Yogyakarta, one of the earl-
iest measures to have profound effects in the countryside was the second Sultan's
pancas revision of 1802, whereby the size of the units of land in his domin-
ions was diminished whilst the tax and corvée obligations on each jung remained at
the old level.!"" The aim of this fiscal expedient was to tap some of the new wealth
in the countryside represented by the extensive new ricefields opened up by farmers
in the late eighteenth century, But, since the measure was not based on a revised
éadastral survey (the last had taken place in 1773-4) and the Sultan did not dispose
of enough village surveyors, it fell unevenly on fertile and infertile areas. Further-
more, it tended to sharpen the inherent differences in the tax burdens on individual
jungs, which were already fixed in a most haphazard fashion. by the apanage holders
and the sovereign. In the lands around Nanggulon in the.Kulon Praga atea, for
example, which were administered directly by 'the Dutch government between 1833
and 1851, surveyors later found huge discrepancies both in the size of the jangs and
in the amount of land reat levied on each jung, with no obvious connection
being made between the population density, the fertility of the soil and the level of
pafég payments."" These imbalances probably helped to encourage the internal mi-
grations of cultivators away from areas of high taxation to those regions where the
burdens were lighter. But ultimately, the tax paying peasants, the s/4ips, had to bear
the brunt of the fiscal discrepancies for all the sovereign's new revenue demands
were passed on to them by the apanage holders. Those who had profited most from
the construction of additional sawa, thus found many of their gains cancelled out
by the heavier tax burdens. Although the individual reactions of the sikips at the
time are not recorded, it is certain that much of Dipanagara's rural support later
came from 'landowning! peasants who saw him as a liberator from fiscal oppression.
Indeed, if any one single issue should pointed out as having prepared the ground for
the Java War in Yogyakarta, it would be this ill-considered pancas revision by the
second Sultan in 1802.

The administration of the tollgares (bendars) in the princely territories was

another factor which gravely exacerbated agrarian discontent before 1825. Although
historians have usually laid the blame for the deleterious effects of the bendars at

XLL

Babad Dipanagara

the door of successive European governments after 1812, the origins of many of the
most oppressive features of the tollgate system can be traced back to the Javanese
rulers themselves.!" According to Crawfurd, no customs' duties had been levied on
internal trade in the principalities prior to 1755, when Sultan Haméngkubuwana 1
(1749-92) signed the first tax farm lease of the bendars with the Head of the Chinese
community (Kepitan cina) in Yogya.)"® The original tollgates grew up after the mid-
eighteenth century at wayside resting places situated a day's journey
apart on the main trade routes. These were frequented by Chinese merchants, some
of whom bought the right from the Kapitan cima to levy a small toll from other
travellers for looking after their belongings overnight. Gradually a fully-fledged han-
dar was established run by Chinese tollgate keepers, often with a local market
attached. Then, as the Chinese became more familiar with the surrounding coun-
tryside and greater pressure was put on them to pay higher tax farm rents, smaller
posts (rargéahs) were set up in adjacent country lanes. Until, just before the outbreak
of the Java War, there was a tollgate at 'the entrance of nearly every village and
hamlet in Central Java'.!"°

The rate of proliferation of the tollgates can be gauged from the level of the tax
farm at various stages between 1755 and 1825. This tripled during the first Sultan's
reign and by 1811, a year before the bandarr.and pasers were taken over by the
European government, the farm stood at four times the original sum." Some of the
increase reflected the intensification of commercial-activity in the principalities, but
even before 1811, Dutch officials were giving warnings that the tollgates were inter-
fering with trade. The quantity of bulk goods, especially tice and salt, traded along
the Sala river between Surakarta and Gresik was already declining in 1796" and
the gédhong rembakan (tobacco warehouses) in Kéedhu, which levied customs" duties
on the export of Kédhu tobacco to the north coast, were hampering the vital com-
merce in tobacco, a major cash crop of the local peasantry.""" Most serious of all,
the tollgates in the core regions (mages «gumg) had led to an increase in the price of
foodstuffs in many areas. This was particularly the case in Yogyakarta which was
dependant on rice imports from southern Kedhu to feed its population."" Times of
dearth and high rice prices such as occurred during the 1820-25 period, thus made
the Yogya area much more susceptible: to agrarian unrest than a region like

Surakarta, which could supply itself from its own hinterland and where provisions
were relatively cheap."**

After 1816, the effects of the tollgates became much worse. The restored
Dutch government was in desperate financial straits and needed every scrap of addi-
tional revenue. Thus, the toll farm in Yogya which had remained approximately
unchanged under the British administration (1812-16), was tripled by 1824. At the
same time, the sales of opium through Chinese tax farmers increased fivefold partly
because of the greater facility of imports from Bengal after the lifting of the British
blockade in 1811.2" The effects of these increases in terms of human suffering in
the principalities were considerable. Farmers could not even journey to a local mar-
ket without passing through a tollgate and the percentage levied on common goods
such as fruit and vegetables was nearly always high because there were no fixed
duties on the produce of Pékarangan (orchards)? Attempts to evade the tollgates
were usually unavailing, for the handers kept spies on cross-country routes and exer-
cised the right to impound a farmers' goods or buffaloes in the event of non-
payment.""" They also frequently maintained their own 'private armies" who were
used both for protection and for exacting retribution on recalcitrant villagers. In Jul

revolt, Chinese merchants were besieged in their houses in Bagélen, and
memwees July and September 1825, whole Chinese communities were put to the
essund by Dipanagara's followers in Central and East Java.?"

The amount of localised violence in rural areas before the Java War shaped
@epuler actitudes to armed conflict."'> In many ways Java at this time was still a soc-
sew geared for warfare and military endeavour. 'The Central Javanese rulers con-
sued to demand armed levies from their apanage holders, and full reviews of
were held on state occasions such as the Gerzhigs or at times of crisis such as
ButSies stack on Yogyakarta in 1812.2!" Villages were required to maintain their
esas stocks of armaments, and cultivators were usually well versed in the handling of
Javanese weapons such as clubs, pikes and slings (Gendbil).'* Women
wese also trained in military skills. At the courts, both rulers had their own female
the 'Amazon corps', who were recruited from the daughters of provin-
sil officials, and some of the female dances (Bzdhayz and S&/mpr) were based on
Swheing movements"! This expertise in military matters at all levels of Javanese
later proved of immense value to Dipanagara duting the Java War. Thus a
Durch officer described how» villagers would often. leave their fields and fall on a
mobile column which had been worsted in a battle with Dipanagara's forces, and
shese is evidence that women fought as active combatants."!* At the time of the
seee of Yogyakarta in August 1825, the body of a woman dressed in male fighting
eostume was found amongst the slin,""" and at least two wives of Javanese noble-
men who rallied to Dipanagara emerged as army commanders. One of these, R.A.
Wedakusuma of Munéng, a daughter of the second Sultan, apparently led the attack
am the Chinese community at Ngawi in September 1825, and when she eventually
sbmitted to the Dutch with her family in 1828, it was noticed that, like other sup-
porters of Dipanagara, she had shaved her head as a pledge for the Holy War (Prang

Besides the support afforded Dipanagara by the rural communities and women,
there were other important groups who ensured the prince a widespread following.
Prominent amongst these were his own family relations from the Yogya kraton and
2 large number of high officials of the Sultanate who brought over their own retain-
ers.""* Both these groups had suffered substantial losses in landholdings due to the
sweeping annexations of territory in Central Java by the European government after
1812. At the same time, the introduction of a putative European estate economy in
the principalities between 1816 and 1823, together with the hasty cancellation of
estate leases in the latter year, which involved large cash indemnities to the planters,

had also played a part in impoverishing the nobility and the leading officials.?" For
many, Dipanagara's rebellion seemed to offer an opportunity to recoup some of
their losses and to make good marriages with members of his family. The prince
clearly encouraged these hopes by attempting to create an alternative administration
and the semblance of a new kraton. Thus, he bestowed royal titles on close family
members and used many of the administrative ranks which had earlier been em-
ployed in the Sultanate. In most cases, the incumbents of these posts created by
Dipanagara stemmed from families who had served the Yogya Sultans in a similar
capacity."" Many of the Yogya elite on Dipanagara's side were also rather young:
the average age of the fifteen Yogya princes who joined him was 34 as opposed to
the average age of 50 of the fourteen other Yogya Pangerans who remained in the
kraton. Those appointed as commanders (A/f Basab) by Dipanagara were even
younger: SEntot was a senior commander at eighteen and there were others in their
early twenties.""" Youthful qualities were valued by Dipanagara. In his words, 'brave-
ry was less met with in old men than in persons of a young age'. The younger
scions of Yogya families were-also those who had suffered most from the
impoverishment of the kraton community.before 1825.2" It was only when it
became evident that Dipanagara would not succeed in establishing himself and
would be defeated by 'the Dutch, that the kraton elite reluctantly began to abandon
his cause.*"*

Another (interesting feature of Dipanagara's relationship with his family and
court supporters is that he permitted the latter a considerable degree of indepen-
dent action in outlying regions. The Java War, therefore, took on the aspect of a
series of provincial uprisings loosely co-ordinated and controlled by Dipanagara and
his advisers who remained mainly in the Mataram area of south central Java. This
aspect is clearly brought out in the present babad where the prince is described dis-
patching letters to his supporters outside Yogyakarta and summoning allies such as
Pangeran Serang (and Tum&nggung Kértadirja to receive their commands at
On the whole, however, the proxy campaigns waged against the Dutch
in the north coast areas and 'theseastern; outlying provinces were short-lived: by the
end of 1825 both Serang and Kértadirja had been defeated in East Java and the
region only became a theatre of war again, for @'short period in 1827-28.""* The
western mancanagara areas, on the other hand, proved much more constant in pro-
viding support for Dipanagara, and even in the last years of the war, when the

prince's military position was desperate, he was still able to find bases in Bagélen
and L&dhok."""

This discrepancy between the reactions to Dipanagara's rebellion in the eastern
and western outlying provinces of the Sultanate was largely determined by historical
factors. Whereas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the states to the west of
the Mataram heartland had been absorbed peacefully into the Central Javanese po-
lity, the provinces around Madiun and further to the east had only recognised
Mataram's authority after prolonged warfare.?" Even in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries the eastern mancamager retained a measure of hostility and
independence from the Central Javanese rulers. The first Sultan, for example, tried
to ensure the loyalty of the region by appointing his most trusted army commander,
Raden Rangga Prawiradiria, the champion (¥gidbug) of Sokawati, as the senior
administrator (Bupati widana) in Madiun.*"" But the distance from Yogya meant
thar the local officials had considerable freedom of action. Thus, Rangga's grandson,
the third Bupat? widana, governed as a virtually independent ruler from his fortified

manded from the local population in the teak woods and for three
aie maar moachs every year until 1812, large numbers of labourers from the eastern
epmmuzces were retained in the capitals to work on royal building projects."" The
af sesamon and services was also high and it is significant that, unlike the cen-
wi amd western districts, the population of the eastern mancamegera was declining
tus period and rich agricultural lands were deserted.""" The inhabitants of
amex sherefore had little cause to offer support for Dipanagara's rebellion which
Wen genbably viewed as an internal quarrel of the Central Javanese states.

Thmomghout Java, however, Dipanagara's struggle against the Dutch had an
which previous dynastic campaigns in. the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
sumes bus lacked. This was because his rebellion took on many of the aspects of a
Sums War (prong sabil) against the 'heathen' (Refir) European colonists and the 'apos-
suum Javanese who afforded them assistance.*.In 1827, the Dutch Minister
all she Colonies, C.Th. Elout (1767-1841), drew the Dutch king's attention to the
Sum shar che influence of religion had played a crucial role in the course of the
Sgtmmg. in nearly every battle, groups of (religious scholars), dressed in their
white turbans /and tabards, had taken part, and their exbortations had
semmed zo stiffen the resolve of-Dipanagara's other troops. Dutch commanders in the
#elld even felt constrained to counteract these influences by attaching whamas to their
wee mobile columns, who chanted @bikrs (incantations from the Q#r'Zn) before their
mes west into battle. They also included prominent religious figures, often Arab
Sexsad: (descendants of the Prophet), in the various abortive peace negotiations with
Dipuzagara in the hopes that this would enbance their influence.*"* It was precisely
she pronounced religious character of the war which caused Elout to reject the sug-
gesson made by some Dutch officials that the hostilities should be terminated by
secognising Dipanagara as an independent prince. In Elout's opinion, the prince's
chem to be recognised as a ratu pantie panatagama. (@ royal protector of religion)
ams his close association with the religious communities made the Java War unique
m the annals of modern Javanese history. The religious factor alone set it com-
pletely apart from the dynastic struggles of previous periods, ?""

 

A rough survey of the available Javanese and Dutch source materials indicates
sar there were about 186 'men of religion' who afforded Dipanagara help at some
sage during the Java War. Many of these derived from the religious hierarchy in
Yogyakarta and from the pradikan (tax free) villages and religious schools in the
Mataram area. Another large group was brought over by Kyai Maja when he joined
Dipanagara early in the war. These included members of Maja's extensive family as
well as many of his students (sentri) who had attended his pésantren in the Pajang
area to the west of Surakarta. Amongst those whose titles can be clearly identified
were 108 Kyais, 31 Hajis (returned Mecca pilgrims), 15 Sebs (Islamic scholars), 12
religious officials and four religious teachers (Kyai gerx) from Mataram, Kédhu and

Bagtlen,""*

Why did these men fight for Dipanagara? In the first place because the religious
communities had suffered the same economic and social constraints as their contem-
poraries in the court towns and the countryside. Many #/zmas, especially those set-

XLV

Babad Dipanagara

tled in the pradiken villages, engaged in farming and local trade and had been
affected by the agrarian crisis of 1821-25. Others depended for their livelihood on
court pensions which had contracted severely over the same period."" The Java
War thus seemed to offer them the chance to improve their social and economic
position. Dipanagara's leadership was particularly important in this respect for he
had maintained close associations with the religious communities from his youth and
appeared to be aiming to establish a state in which they would enjoy more political
power than they were permitted either under the Dutch or under the Central
Javanese rulers. Kyai Maja's role as Dipanagara's principal religious and political
adviser between 1825-28 also assured the sanfris a key position in the prince's
administration. Thus religious scholars were chosen principally for the elite body-
guard regiments and some were given control of lands and villages in areas loyal to
Dipanagara.2"®

Additional factors influenced the religious communities in the years immedi-
ately preceding the Java War. First, the attitude of Christian Europeans, especially
government civilian and military personnel, towards Muslim Javanese appears to
have been disdainful and insulting.""" Second, government actions against respected
religious teachers in Central Java, aroused considerable local resentment."*° Third,
and perhaps most important, the legal reforms introduced by Raffles in 1812 and
continued by succeeding Governor-Generals, were viewed by sentris and even by
the court elite as an unjustifiable infringement of the sovereignty of Javanese-Islamic
law."*" The (combination of these three factors helped-to.reinforce a sense of com-
mon identity in/ the face of what the religious communities undoubtedly saw as
'persecution' on the part of the European government.. This was doubly dangerous
since it occurred at a time when closer relations with the heartland of the Islamic
world in Arabia, through pilgrimage and Arab immigration into Indonesia, were
imbuing Javanese Muslims with a greater sense of the power and glory of Islam."*"

Dipanagara's declared intention of 'raising up the high state of the Islamic relig-
ion in Java! (mangun agami Islam ing Tanah Jawa sadaya), which was
probably prompted by Kyai\ Maja; epitomised the hopes of some Javanese at this
time for a return to the exercise of Javanese-Islamic law based on the precepts of
the Quran and othervlegal .commentaries.?®On a wider level, Dipanagara's
endeavours were directly concerned with Javanese political independence and cul-
tural autonomy. Hence his insistence in 1830 that the Dutch should return to their
eighteenth century position as traders on the north coast and should not involve
themselves with the internal political affairs of the princely states."** Hence too his
emphasis that European prisoners should adopt Javanese dress and that they should
use Javanese (preferably Arama), rather than Malay, in all their conversations." In
many ways Dipanagara was a conservative, deeply concerned with the cultural integ-
rity of Java. He also made a genuine attempt to bind very disparate elements of
Javanese society to his cause and in this sense he was probably the first 'nationalist
leader-in modern Javanese history. But there were many internal contradictions
about his style of leadership and his attempt to embody the aspirations of the rural
communities, the kraton elite and the santris.*** Ukimately, there was bound to be a
conflict of interest between the various groups, especially between the nobility and
the 'men of religion'. Indeed, it is a measure of the depth of the social and
economic discontent in Java at this time and the strength of cultural and religious
fervour that the alliance was able to hold together for so long.

PSS OF THE TEXT

egpess with a description of the situation in Yogyakarta after the accession
Sulzen, Haméengkubuwana V, on. 20 December 1822. The appointment
Suizem's guardians is referred to and these are wrongly designated as his
de Pangeran Mangkubumi, his uncle Pangeran Dipanagare, the Yogya Patih,
Audigess Danurcja IV and the Durch Resident,; A.H. Smissaert (v. 1-5). The
es asmomes: the guardians are then described and 'the babad writer relates
Gms Mangkubumi and Dipinagera were very rarely consulted on important
sem # sesse. A brief account of the wilful and corrupt administration of the
ame orker Yorya officials follows. The writer relates how Dipanagara was pro-
disnurbed by these developments and built a péanggraban (pavilion) for
a Tegaircia where he often withdrew to meditate. The prince's pilgrimages
am Mismcsnzen on the south cosst and his visits to other holy places in the Mataram
- emmm ame also mentioned (v.6~12). Then follows a long description of Dipanagara's
seme az Sclaromg in the limestone hills to the south-west of Yogyakarta and the
improvements to the area around the cave of Sécang, which he used as a
sesmess. A ist of the plants and shrubs grown by Dipanagara on his estate are men-
as well as his custom of retiring there often with his family and retainers
wn 43-35). The scene shifts again to Tégalreja where Dipanagara is depicted telling
Bus mupporsers about his deep, dissatisfaction 'concerning recent developments in the
Open rebellion against the Dutch and their supporters in the Yogya court is
and Dipanagara makes a direct appeal for help duting the coming conflict
ww 47-21). Dipanagara's scribes are then summoned and the prince orders them to
|__ wmire Serzers to incite the disgruntled elements in Yogyakarta: the Areas (robbers),
qeessamurely dismissed administrators (Bupati dbongko!) and other embittered offi-
ow. 22-24). At the same time, Resident Smissaert is depicted holding a meeting
awit his Dutch and Javanese administrative colleagues in which the question of
empmowing some of the side roads around the Sultan's capital is discussed. One of
shese is planned to cross straight through the middle of Dipanagara's estate at Tegal-
and markers are duly placed across the prince's territory along the trace of the
mew road. When this happens Dipanagara is absent at Sélarong (v.25-26).

Canto II

On his return to Tégakéia, Dipanagara notices that a new road has been staked out.
He ascertains from the captain of his bodyguard (Lurab KapZdbak) that the markers
Rave been placed by an orderly from office and two Dutch road over-

seers. Whereupon, he orders his estare workers (Magérsari) and. bodyguards
(Kaptdhak) to tear out the markers. News of this action reaches the Assistant-
Resident of Yogya, P.F.H. Chevallier, and he reports at once to Smissaert who falls
into a towering rage and gives vent to his feelings about Dipanagara (v. 1-6).
Amongst other things, he enveighs against the prince's contacts with the religious
communities (semris) and his neglect of his responsibilities as a guardian of the
young Sultan. In conclusion, he orders Chevallier to send out the Macaren,
Danurja's police officials, to Tégalréja to replace the markers in their former posi-
tions (v. 7-11). The Assistant-Resident complies and the Maranar corps are
described as they set out for Dipanagara's residence (v. 12-16). Once at
they immediately begin replacing the torn out markers. Their actions are reported
to Dipanagara who instructs the Megérseri and Kapidbak to rip out the markers
again from behind the group of Macaman and to resist them if attacked (v. 17-20).

Canto 11

This they proceed to do, but they>are.noticed by the two Dutch road overseers
attached to the Macanen work party who inform the head (Lurzb) of the corps,
Macan SEmbawa. The latter tells his men not to use their weapons but to beat off
Dipanagara's followers with staves and clubs. The Maceman are then depicted mak-
ing these weapons and one member, Macan Laut, thinks about the booty he plans to
seize in battle (v. 1-8). A fight between the Macaran and Dipanagara's men then
takes place whichis portrayed in very stylised terms. The better training and disci-
pline of the Mag?rsari and Kaptilhak gives them the upper hand (v. 9-17). The police
officials, meanwhile, begin to have the worst of the bartle and many lie crippled on
the ground. Their Lnreé, Macan SEémbawa, comes forward as a picked champion to
defy Dipanagara's men, but, at this point, the babad writer appears to confuse him
with Macan Laut who, far from seizing any booty, is himself stripped bare and
humiliated by Dipanagara's supporters (v. 18-25).

Canto IV

Dipanagara, who had been watching the fight from an adjoining hillock and had
hugely enjoyed secing the discomfiture of the-Macanan, gives out rewards to his
followers (v. 1-5). The defeated Maczran and the Dutch road overseers beat a
hasty retreat to the Yogyakarta Residency building. There the overseers relate the
events at Tégalr&ja to the Resident and his Assistant, who become so besides them-
selves with rage that they are depicted in their wrath like Aaser (unrefined) charac-
ters in the wayang theatre (v. 6-12). Danuréija is summoned to the Residency and
he orders one of his Maniris (junior officials) to escort the Macanan back to his
residence (the A¥patiban) (v. 13-14). Smissaert once again convenes a meeting of all
the senior Dutch and Javanese officials in the capital to decide what further mess-
ures should be taken against Dipanagara. Smissaert and Chevallier counsel harsh
measures against the prince, but Danur#ja advances a more moderate and cautious
policy. He suggests that co-operation and support from Surakarta should be elicited
under the pretext of co-operation over road building projects in the two kingdoms
If Dipanagara then persists in his obstinate attitude, in Danuréija's opinion, he will be
faced by the combined opposition of the two courts, Surakarta and Yogyakarta i»

15-25). All the other officials present applaud Danurija's suggestion and a letter =
drawn up for the Surakarta Patih (v. 26-29).

Tazns VI

The arrival of messengers at Surakarta is described and his letter about
ss=aperation over road building projects 'in the |principalities is delivered. After
perusing the letter, the Surakarta Prime Minister, Sasradiningrat, rejects the idea of
ex-operation because of the lack of provision for it in previous custom (ada?) (v.
4-7). The Surakarta Resident, H.M. MacGillayry, concurs and Sasradiningrat gives
emders to the Surakarta officials and workmen to undertake the construction of
suads to the north of Yogyakarta but not in places administered directly by the Sul-
sumare. A letter to this effect is drafted and sent to Yogyakarta (v. 8-13). On its
artival, Smissaert instructs Danurcja to take the appropriate action. Yogya officials
aad road overseers are then sent out in the direction of Magélang and to the west of
the capital (v. 14-15). The discussion about Dipanagara and his opposition to the
road construction at is resumed. Once again Danuréja is shown advancing
moderate and sensible advice. He suggests that the prince should be summoned to
the Residency in order to discuss the road building issue. Amidst scenes of con-
viality the meeting breaks up and on Monday 18 July 1825 the officials convene
again at the Residency (v. 16-26). Two office orderlies from the Aipatihan are dis-
patched to in order to summon Dipanagera, but he refuses to comply (v.
27-31). Danurja continues to counsel moderation and patience, and advises the
disparch of further messengers to invite the prince to come to Yogya. The following

day, the officials meet again at the Residency, but, although Dipanagara has by now
received four separate summonses, he still refuses to come. The elderly Mang-
kubumi is instructed to go to Téegalr¥ja to win over the prince (v. 32-36).

Canto VII

After Mangkubumi's departure, the Dutch and Javanese officials await his return
impatiently and view his long absence with concern. Danur¥ja urges them to be
patient and to convene again the following morning in order to discuss the dispatch
of an expeditionary force to Tégalrtja, in case Mangkubumi did not return (v.
1-4). The following morning, Smissaert and Chevallier canvass opinions about the
right course of action to be taken and Danurja urges that a clear response should be
obtained from Dipanagara. Thereupon, Sindunagara, a high Yogya official and two
Dutch orderlies are dispatched to Tégalr¢ja to take Smissaert's final message (v.
5-11). The scene changes to Dipanagara's residence where the prince is described
entertaining his uncle, Mangkubumi, and two other relations. Mangkubumi warns
his nephew that if he does not comply with Smissaert's request and go to the Resi-
dency, his estate will be attacked, Perceiving Dipanagara's weak military position,
Mangkubumi advises him strongly against any resistance which might bring him into
conflict with the Yogya court and the Dutch. He cities various examples from
seventeenth and eighteenth century Javanese history to support his argument, but
Dipanagara replies in a cold, succinct fashion, dismissing his uncle's warnings and
leaving everything to the Almighty (v. 12-18). Shortly afterwards, Sindunagara and
the two Dutch orderlies arrive at Tégalr®ja and humbly present Smissaert's final
letter to Dipanagara. The latter then waves aside the Resident's request in a haughty
speech full of insulting expressions. Sindunagara and his companions depart amazed
and dumbfounded (v. 19-26).

Canto VIII

Once Smissaert has been informed about the prince's reply, he immediately plans to
take charge in person of the: expedition against Téegalréja. Danurja, however, urges
that a more appropriate leader should be chosen. The commander of the palace
guard, Wiranagara, is dispatched .to. parade the. court regiments in preparation for
the expedition (v. 1-7). The Javanese troops are then described as they set out for
Tégalréja alongside the Dutch soldiers commanded by Chevallier. One of the regi-
mental commanders, Surabraja, is particularly singled out for his swashbuckling
appearance (v. 8-12). At Tégalreja, Dipanagara rallies his forces in preparation for
the expected Dutch attack. Arms are distributed and the womenfolk, children and
older retainers are sent away to Sélarong. Dipanagara's followers are drawn up in
battle formation. The prince himself is portrayed in a courtly fashion like the
wayang character, Samba, but wearing the apparel of the Holy War (a turban, and
long white tabard). His horses are paraded in front of him (v. 13-22). The scene
changes to the soldiers of the palace guard commanded by Wiranagara, who are tak-
ing part in the expedition against Tégalréja. Some of these troops are described
deliberating amongst themselves as to the justice of attacking Dipanagara. The resi-
mental commander, Surabraja and other Javanese officers, concur with their sent-
ments and decide to express their doubts to Wiranagara (v. 23-28). The latter is
approached and questioned about the true reason for the attack on Tégalréja. The
officers even threaten insubordination if Wiranagara does not give a satisfactor
answer. Hearing this, Wiranagara falls into a rage and uses threats towards Surs>
raja. A fight nearly breaks out and the officers fire on Wiranagara with their pisto=

Seemuug his, Chevallier decides to use his artillery. which completely demoralises
Sumsibezis and his men. They retreat and huddle before Dipanagara, who berates
as cowards unworthy to fight in the Holy War. This speech humiliates them
sm suounting another counter-attack which again inflicts serious losses on Cheval-
force. In reply, Chevallier fires another artillery volley and Surabraja is shot to
meses. Dipanagara and his troops decide to flee and they slip out of a side gate at
Tegalstia as the war alarms sound (v. 1-11). They head for Sélarong via a circuit-
sus soute. In the meantime, Ranadiningrat and Wiranagara lie in wait for them on
she soad. Dipanagara, aware that an ambush is intended, prepares to meet them and
smmounces his wish to engage Wiranagara alone in single combat. He draws his
gusebe ris (stabbing dagger, a family heirloom) and battle is joined. Eventually
Dipanagara meets Wiranagara in hand to hand combat, but although he lunges at
tem with his ris, the dagger missesvits mark and 'instead lops off the ears of
Wiranagara's horse (v. 20-24). Wiranagara then makes good his escape along the
swer Winonga and Ranadiningrat takes charge .of the fighting. He is wounded as
Dipanagara's forces withdraw to Selarong (v. 25-30). Ranadiningrat and Wiranagara
seport back to Chevallier at Tégalréja (v. 31-32).

Canto X

Chevallier decides to send out spies to ascertain where Dipanagara and his followers
mave gone. The spies go as far as Bantul to the south of Yogya where they learn
from the local inhabitants that the prince has regrouped his forces at Sélarong (v.
1-6). They report back to Chevallier who draws up a letter for Smissaert. Tégalr&ja
is plundered and burnt by Chevallier's men as the Dutch and Javanese expedition-
ary force withdraws to Yogya. In Yogya, Smissaert is told of the events at Téegal-
réja at a meeting which is attended by the senior Dutch and Javanese officials (v.
7-12). Paku Alam is also present accompanied by most of his personal standing
army (Legion'). Inevitably Smissaert falls into a rage, but once again Danuréja coun-
sels moderation and suggests that, rather than send out an immediate expedition
against Sélarong, messengers should be dispatched to Surakarta and Batavia to
inform the relevant authorities about recent events (v. 13-20). Letters are written

LL

Babad Dipanagara

and dispatched by fast couriers. The scene changes to Sélarong where Dipanagara is
described ordering his scribes to write letters to his sympathisers on the north coast
and in other areas in Central and East Java asking them to take part in the Holy
War. Pangeran Serang, an independent prince from the north coast area, and
Tum¥Znggung Kértadirja, a dismissed Bupati from the Sokawati region, are
appointed as army commanders in their respective areas (v. 21-30). The bestowal of
these commands at Sélarong is described and various supporters of Dipanagara are
raised in rank. Dipanagara changes his name to that of Panembahan Tuwan Seh
Ngabdulkamid and a loyal religious supporter, Kyai Taptajani, is placed in charge of
Dipanagara's followers from the religious communities (v. 31-35). Battle orders are
drawn up for Dipanagara's commanders in distant areas and petty tradesmen are
instructed not to sell their wares in Yogyakarta so that there will be a dearth of
foodstuffs in the capital. Numerous other army commanders are also portrayed tak-
ing up positions in villages around the capital (v. 36-38).

Canto XI

The village levies who rallied to Dipanagara are described. The babad writer refers
to these by the deprecating term of brandbal (freebooters). Inside Yogyakarta, fires
are started by Dipanagara's supporters, many. buildings are burnt and a heavy pall of
smoke covers the town (v. 1-6). Meanwhile, Smissaert's messenger arrives in
Surakarta. The Sala Patih, Sasradiningrat, and the Resident, MacGillavry, are
informed of the tragic turn of events in Yogya (v. 7-12). The Surakarta court offi-
cials are then instructed by the Patih to assemble at the- meeting place (@asehen) on
the northern great square (@lun-alun) before the Surakarta court. Two senior offi-
cials are delegated to go into the kraton to inform the ruler, Sunan Pakubuwana VI,
about the developments. The latter thanks them in a succinct fashion (v. 13-16).
MacGillavry then writes a covering letter to Smissaerc's reports and the whole bundle
is sealed and sent on to Semarang and Batavia (Jakarta) (v. 24-25). Simultaneously,
Lieutenant Portier, a military adjutant of the Residency, is detailed to go to the
mountainous southern-province of Gunung, Kidul to bring in two recalcitrant
Yogyakarta and Surakarta officials. At the same time, Sasradiningrat arranges for
guards to be placed around Surakarta (v. 26-29).

Canto XH

Three days later, Lt. Portier returns bringing the two Gunung Kidul officials who are
put in prison. In Semarang, the Resident, H.J. Domis, receives the bundle of letters
and reports sent on by MacGillavry (v. 1-4). He calls a meeting of his Residency
council who all peruse the letters. Domis then asks the Bupati of Semarang, Raden
Adipati Aria Cakranagara, about the measures which should be adopted to ensure
security in the Semarang area. Cakranagara suggests that the boundaries of the Resi-
dency should be patrolled and that travel passes should be issued to everyone cir-
culating in the area. He concludes by adding a penetrating analysis of the very dif-
ferent characters of Dipanagara and Mangkubumi (v. 5-16). Domis is impressed by
the Bupati's arrangements and the letters are sent on to Batavia by fast courier (v
17-21). In Yogyakarta, meanwhile, Smissaert is described holding an audience with
the Yogyakarta Bupatis. All the Dutch officials present feel uneasy about their own
personal responsibility for the current state of affairs. Danuréja refuses to offer any
further advice to Smissaert until the messengers have returned from Batavia (v

22-28). Smissaert then decides to administer an oath of loyalty to the Yogya off

cials, who are invited to the Residency office for this purpose (v. 29-30).

*!See note 48 of the babad. According to Dr. Pigeaud, Sultan Haméengkubuwana |
VII of Yogyakarta (1877-1920) used to make a point of addressing Dutchmen |
whose names began with a 'P" by using the sastrz sware 'fa' rather than 'pa' since this
was regarded as being more correct in the Javanese estimation. Thus a Dutchman
with the name of 'Polen', for example, would be addressed as 'Folen', Interview with
Dr. Th.G.Th. Pigeaud, Leiden, Jul. 1973.

**This is a very wide topic which will be discussed at length in Chap. 2 of the pres-
ent author's forthcoming publication 'Pangeran Dipanagara and the Making of the
Java War'. One example of the difference can be seen in the styles of dress. Thus
the Surakarta princes were quicker to adopt European military uniforms and official
dress than their colleagues in Yogyakarta. The Sela Crown Prince (the future PB V
apparently always wore European dress when he visited the Residency and both PB
IV and PB VI had the habit of making tours outside the court to the royal retreats
accompanied by a numerous escort all clad in well tailored European outfits (monter
ing stukken). In Yogyakarta, however, HB IV's love of his Dutch Major-Generals
uniform and his attempt to wear it during GarZh¥g ceremonies created a scandal is
court circles and it was not until the 1840's that the such sartorial habits began to be
viewed more favourably, see vAE (@anwinsten, 1900) no. 239, J.G. van den Berg.

and musicians, masked,

®B IVs own participation in the Miksa dance, which he would perform with
«e= prominent princes of the Sala court, is mentioned in J6z. In July 1807, on the
seuzzsmon of the celebration for the appointment of Louis Bonaparte as King of Hol-

There is no mention of wayang worg performances at the Sunan's court at this

amd the articles of B. Schrieke and Th. Pigeaud, 'Wayang Wong', D/dwé, vol. 9

ment during the reign of Sultan Haméngkubuwana V of Yogyakarta (1822-26/
1828-55), see Dr. Br. 18, J.F.W. van Nes, 'Karakrerschets van den tegenwoordigen

The MS. used by Poensen;-LOr 5765, has been discussed by M.C. Ricklefs in his
article, 'On the Authorship of Leiden Cod. Or. 2191, Babad Mangkubumi', BKI,
vol. 127 (1971), p. 263. The authorship of the Babad Batawi was attributed to Paku
Alam 1 by Ki Hadjar Dewantara, see his Letteren en Kunst in het
Pakoe-Alamsche Géslacht (Djokia: H. Buning, 1931), pp. 13-14. It describes the
events leading up to Paku Alam I's and his son, RT. Natadiningrat's (later Paku
Alam 11), imprisonment under Daendels in Cirebon (Jan.-May 1811) and their sub-
sequent exile in Batavia and Surabaya under Janssens and Raffles until Dec. 1811,
hence the title of the work (on these events see Poensen, op. cit., pp. 221-271)
Dewantara's assertion is plausible for it is known that Paku Alam I was a /ittératenr
of distinction and that many writing materials were found amongst his baggage in
Cirbon, see Dj. Br. 39, P. Engelhard to Danuréja I1,.5 May 1811.

summarised in his conversation with Major de Stuers, see De Klerck, vol. V, p.
743;
'... the people of Madiun are good in resisting a first atrack and they acquit
themselves well, but afterwards they are not much use. The people of Pajang
are also brave, but likewise for a short space of time. The people from Bagélen
are better, but they must be able to fight in their own area; if they are outside
it, they collapse quickly. But the men from Mataram are the best of all; they

1812, certain pradikan villages had been exempt from tollgate dues and market
taxes, see KITLV H 696g (Rouffaer papers), trans, of 'Gold Farm Letter, 1 Sawal
AJ. 1734 (2 Dec. 1807). It is not certain whether this privilege continued after
1812, but if it did then the religious communities may have been shielded to some
extent from the harsher aspects of the tollgate and market tax farms. For references
to religious scholars and Haj#s who received pensions from the Yogya court in c.
1820, see Louw, vol. I, p. 592. The total pensions to court sen/ris and members of
the 'priestly' bodyguard regiments had declined from Sp.D. 833 in 1814 to Sp. D.
416 in 1820, comparative figures from Dj. Br. 29, Capt. R.C. Garnham, 'Statement
of Annual Expenditure in the Cratton by the late Sultan Hamangkubuana the 3rd, 1
Dec. 1814 and Louw, loc. cit.

"5On Dipanagara's elite regiments see A.S.H. Booms, Eenige bladzijden, p. 34. Two
special corps which provided a lifeguard for Dipanagara were the 'Jayengans' com-
manded by Pengalasan (see above pt. V B) and the Swryagamas' commanded by
Dipanagara himself, see further Louw, vol. I1, pp. 502-3. Various relations and followers
of Kyai Maja were appointed as administrative officials in the Pajang area during the war,
see Knocrle, 'Journal", pp. 24-5.
""See Knoerle, 'Journal', pp. 14-15; something of the religious communities' sense
of outrage can be seen in Dipanagara's remark:
'that no matter who should be given preference between Jesus and Mubammad,
the spirit of patient endurance was to be found more in the Qur'Zn that in ...
(Christian) ... works. Muslims had included much of the teachings of Jesus in
the Q@r'an ... (and) they also considered Jesus a man chosen by God (and) born
from the breath of the Almighty. (But) ... Christians on the other hand soiled
the Divine Sending of Mubamnmad with contumely and sought to show the
Prophet as an imposter."

**See Knoerle, 'Journal', pp. 4-5, where Dipanagara enveighed against the Dutch
screst of an aged and revered religious teacher, Kyai Murma Wijaya; see also

an alma whilst he was giving a lesson in his NvB, Port. 9, pc. 3, 'Onlus-

See art. 8 of Raffles' treaties with the Sultan and the Sunan in Aug. 1812 in Van
Deventer, Nederlandsch Gezag, p. 323, p. 329 which stipulated that all cases between
»sbjects of the independent princes and those born outside the principalities (includ-
img Europeans and foreign Asiatics) should be tried in Government courts; for a full
description of the workings of the judiciary during Raffles period see Major W.
Thorn, Memoir of the Conquest of Java (London, 1815), pp. 226-31 and for the regu-
lations concerning the Residents' courts set up by Raffles in 1814 which replaced
she old landraden (Landdrost's courts), see Raffles, HJ, vol. II, Appendix D. The
of the jury system by Raffles and the use of 'Government' law (ie.
Dutch law, Roman law and the Statutes passed in Batavia and in the States-General
Raving application to Indonesia) is discussed in IOL, Java Factory Records G. 21/67,
Raffles to the Chairman of the East India Company, 19 Mar. 1812; and see further
=. 12 of the babad.

Dipanagara later remarked that 'the (European) authority in Java was a great mis-
fortune for the Javanese people, because they had been taken away from the Holy
Law of the Prophet and had been subjected to European laws (Knoerle, 'Journal, p.
30) and on another occasion he. mentioned that every alzma in Java who could read
che Qur'an was deeply disturbed by the abolition of the penalties of Islamic law in

criminal cases, GKA, 20 Sepr. 1830 no. 58k, Van den Bosch to P. Merkus, 19 Apr.
1830.

**See C. Snouck Hurgronje, Arabi? en Osst-Indi? (Leiden, 1907), pp. 19-20;

'Batavia, 1886), p. 111 (on the beginnings of mass immigration into Java by Arabs
from the Hadhramaut in the late 18th century).

**See n. 30 of the babad.

**'See Carey, 'Javanese Histories', pp. 287-288.

"*On Dipanagara's treatment of European prisoners see KITLV H 263, P.D. Por-
wer, 'Verklaring ... houdende een verhaal van ziin-gevangenschap bij de
muitelingen', n.d. (? 1828); Carey, 'Javanese Histories'; p. 275 n. 32 and Payen,
Voyage', entry of 13 Sept. 1825 on.a captured Dutch dragoon who had been forced
to wear Javanese clothes.

"*One example of this is Dipanagara's admiration of Sultan Agung (1613-45)
whom he described as a 'spiritual man who did as I did travelling around every-
where (on local pilgrimages) and as 'a great Islamic ruler who had established the
five pillars of Islam! (see Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p. 17). Yet it was precisely
Agung who was the first Mataram ruler to effectively curb the power of the spiritual
rulers of Giri (in 1635) and was the most energetic proponent of centralisation. He
was thus hardly the sort of ruler who would have appealed to the religious com-
munities.

ENGLISH TRANSLATION
CANTO I

1. This poctic work was begun to be written

on Thursday Wage, on the nineteenth

of the month Besar, in the year Be

at eleven o'clock at night.

The Javanese year was two,

fifty,

seven hundred.

one thousand, no more (19 Besar, faun Be, AJ. 1752/3 (14 Aug. 1825).
The Dutch year was one thousand, eight hundred,

twenty (and) five (1825).

 

2. We now change the tale.

His Highness the Sultan

of the kingdom of Yogyakarta,

the fifth, was still young.

His Highness was five years old'.

The Sultan received guardians,

four were established?.

The first guardian was his grandfather,
who was called Pungeran Mangkubumi.
He had control of the Kadipaten®,

3. (and) was the head of the Sultan's family
in Yogyakarta Adiningrat,

The second guardian

was the uncle of the Sultan

who governed all inside the court:

men and women

within the court deferred

to Pangeran Dipanagara®.

Whereas, the third guardian was the leader
of the officials in Yogyakarta.

4. He governed all outside the court,

the high and low in Yogyakarta.

The Sultan's Nayakas®

did not wish to oppose

Raden Adipati

Danuréja". All his wishes

were carried out.

Furthermore, the fourth guardian

held the final authority in exercising justice

in the law of fixed punishment and retaliation®.

many of their orders were not authorized,

numerous old customs were abrogated

(and) the common people were bewildered".

There were changes in the direction of the state

(and) there was much wickedness. Bandits, hlghwaymm rgbbcrs (and) thieves
could move about in the kingdom. -

8. - The law of the Surumbi Wits notenforced,

nor was the administration of justice by the Pradata upheld."
All the essential elements of law were disregarded,
arbitrariness prevailed,

and in authority were those who were still strong,

(acting) in an unsuitable (and) unmannerly fashion.

They did not think far ahead.

Many people were dismissed by ruses (and)

in the councils other men took their places,

descendants of common people.

Much of their attachment

for the state and their king was lost.
The ricinus tree sprang up,

10. - At that time Pangeran Dipanagara

built a pavilion at Tegalréja!*

which served as a residence.

It lay to the north of the kraton''.

Night and day he constantly felt his sorrow.

He made a retreat

Night and day

Pangeran Dipanagara was there constantly engaged in meditation;
exceeding was his asceticism.

11. If occasionally he went along the coast,

he made a pilgrimage to Mancingan'?.

He disguised himself as.a-servant when travelling
(and) entered lonely caves'",

traversed the jungle (and) climbed mountains!®.
Not long afterwards Pangeran Dipa-

nagara would return

to his residence at Tegalréja,

The Pangeran built another pavilion

at (a place) called Selarong®,

12. - It was situated to the west of the capital,
to the south of Ambarkatawang®"

in the area of the hill of Selarong:

A large pavilion was built, ~ |.

a place of recreation"? like a royal compound.
There were three gates in a row

and something like an alun-afur'".

To the north-east in the hill there was

a large opening called the cave of Sécang.

It was made into a garden®*.

All expressed their loyalty.

Pangeran Dipanagara's spirit was aroused,
just as a fire (which) flares up.

18. - (He said): "I accept your loyalty

to me my followers,

(but) wait, it could be later

1 may find a reason

to enable me to leave the capital".

| hope I will be chased away

by a great army

(and) Tégalréja will be filled (with troops);

for although I will flee the capital,

it would be better if it is occasioned by-batile.

19. - It is up to you if will help- me.

If you have difficulties (and) cannot give aid in battle,
just follow me later

wherever I am.

If I should flee without

being motivated by an issue,

my heart would not be content."

All expressed their agreement

(and) begged leave separately to return home.

The Pangeran remained seated.

20. His heart was enflamed (and) emboldened
as he wished (to wage) the Holy War®. | |-*

His officials sat in rows before him

(and) the Pangeran said pleasantly;

"Eh, all of you, members of my forces.

why is my heart afflicted

when I observe

all the actions of that man Danuréja?

It is as if there is no real man among the people,
no opponent to him in the state.

22. Pangeran Dipanagara summoned

his scribes, who served as his trusted old attendants,
called Sastraprayitna

and Sastradimgja®®.

Both arrived (and) paid their respects.

The Pangeran said:

"Fathers, I send you

Inside and outside the town

they were all in agreement.

We now change the tale again.

Resident Smissaert was just

holding a meeting

He wished to make a road**

26. The unanimous opinion was

that a trace should be made to the west

At the northern extremity (the trace) met

Tegalréja, the residence

4. When

Secretary Chevallier heard

that Pangeran

Dipanagara had torn out

all the markers,

he dressed himself, (took) a carriage, (and) reported to
the Residency house.

Hendrik Smissaert was just then

sitting in a chair in the cast gallery.

5. He sat behind a small table"" writing
(and) was amazed at the arrival

of Mr. Chevallier. He (Chevallier) sat down.
in front of him (and) spoke slowly.

He kept his hat under his arm

(and) stuttering forth rather nervously (said):
"I wish to inform you

that all the markers

across Tégalréja have been-torn up

6. by Pangeran Dipanagara,
not one remains standing...

Besides, the other

markers along (the road)

have all been thrown away."

When Hendrik Smissaert heard.

the speech of Chevallier, -
he hurled down his pen (and) dame his ?ush»
his eyes stared forward redly (and) his eyebrows bristled.

7. Mr. Smissaert said:

"Eh. Chevallier, I consider that

Pangeran Dipanagara

cannot be treated in a graceful fashion,

for long I have noticed

that his thinking seemed strange.

He is searching for a pretext

as he wishes to oppose the Government'*,

so the markers have been used as a beginning.

8. He is hiding something (although) he is in the open,
he crouches low (but) is seen. He gives the impression
of being an egg-saint,

In the morning he sent a messenger to call

named Macan Sembawa** (saying):

"Eh, you, Macan Sembawa

and all your men,

place the markers

at Tégalréja (again) firmly."

Macan Sembawa made a sembah,

acquiesced (and) departed immediately

led by the orderly and the road overseers.

14. He took with him a Bekel, (and) his jajars®®,

who were thirty men of the Macanan,

(dressed in) short breeches (and) jackets

of the red bintulu design®?,

with (kris) handles of the Balinese style!®

(and) gayaman sheathes.

Their bebeds" (and) head-dress were both

of dark purple (and their) moustaches were darkened and twirled.
(They were) big and tall, in their actions like giants.

15. They did exactly as they wished.

Their duty was to make the rounds at night

(and) make tours inside the capital. 3
They kept an eye out for evil folk

(and) during the day they prohibited 7

people (who played) gimer, keplek and kubuk®.
Because they were old hands at the trade,

if the alarm

at the first kenthung (thump) a Macanan would arrive,

16. (and) at the third kenthung,

the Macanan would descend like drizzle.

and young Macanan®* (cubs) all at once r

would be ready to gather evidence,

in high spirits,

as if they expected to encounter

gold coins, dinars. a dhacin (in weight)".

Soon (the Macanan) arrived

at Tégalréja (and) they all placed the markers together.

17. These were all lined up

in conformity with the previous trace,

no different from before®.

Those placing the markers set to it noisily.

When the Pangeran heard

the clamour and tumult,

he immediately sent someone to investigate.

The person sent said in a gentle fashion,

making a sembah, his face as though touching the ground:

Pangeran Dipanagara said loudly:

Magersaris, immediately,

See that not one remains.

hurriedly tore up the markers;

Kyai Plered and moreover

Martalaya was at Gondhang,

Dipadirja was at Sumber,

Suranagara was one of those

43. - In all four directions

commanders from the capital were placed;

is entirely up to your wishes.

In fact the works are to be done by themselves,
for it has never been done before

by the two united (Surakarta and Yogyakarta).

7. That is the custom in the past.
But, if

Sir. you order

roads (and) bridges to be made,

I will certainly do it."

Slowly spoke

Resident MacGillayry:

8. "I am not willing (to co-operate) if this would imply a deviation
from previous adar,

but as concerns the letter of reply,

1 leave that up to you.""

The Raden Adipati

ordered a letter of reply

to be drawn up immediately;

9. and commanded that state Maniris should be sent for
together with the road overseers

(both) Dutch and Javanese,

who were ordered to undertake

(the building) of bridges, dikes and roads!"*

to the north of Yogyakarta
and to the west of the capital (Surakarta),

10, - but they were forbidden to undertake (work) mudc the town (of Yogyakarta).

The letter, as soon as it was drawn up.
was given a parallel

letter in Dutch.

The Outer and Inner Mamris arrived
together with the road overseers.

They received their orders (and) departed.

11. The Panews and Mantri messengers from Yogya
departed together.

We do not tell of their journey,

(but) they travelled swiftly.

They arrived in Yogyakarta

12. The contents of the letter of reply were read

for there was no change

in the etiquette of the letter.

They (the Parewus and Mantris) were ordered to receive

Now they were given as companions

14. - Resident Smissaert (then) instructed
the Raden Adipati

to appoint assistants

for the construction of the roads

to the north and

to the west of the capital.

The Raden Adipati agreed:

15. Already the Panewus, Mantis and

Previously at Tégalréja
I wanted to make
a good road,

18. (but) Pangeran Dipanagara did not permit it.
Nay, up till now

he still stands firm.

Should I cancel it?"

The Raden Adipati said:

"If it is cancelled

it will be seen badly by people,

19. subsequently orders will not be respected.
It is no good forgiving him.

(But) if it is carried through

it will surely come to a dispute.

The Pangeran has already retreated abashed.
It is an unimportant matter which

is discussed in terms of war.

20. We are not waging war to seize money. women or land.
it is not like that.

If it comes to battle,

a road will be the issue

(and) the victory will not be a reason for rejoicing.

Soldiers will die

(for something which) is not of the slightest value!}.

21. If you permit it, please summon the Pangeran
to report to the Residency.

If he comes,

ask him what

would be the best road

through Tegalréja
even if it curves slightly*"5,

22. If it might be enough for a guarding circle to be built
around the capital,

(then), Sir, excuse

the Pangeran's offence.

But perhaps if

(the plan) is not to your liking, Sir,

please, I offer it (humbly) in both my hands."

35. The Resident said slowly:
"Ah, Pangeran Mangkubumi,

I am dispatching you as an envoy
to Tegalréja,

(for) I am inviting your nephew,
Pangeran Dipanagara,

to the Residency.

36. It is up to you (row), (for) you are already an old man.
Try to make him (come) here.

You should take the responsibility

so that there will be no doubt (about the outcome)."
Pangeran Mangkubumi departed

for Tégalréja'*'

to lecture sweetly.

CANTO VH

1... The Nayakas were still

all together in the office

awaiting the arrival of the Pangeran.

The four Nayakas were discussing together;
namely, Chevallier and the Raden Adipati,
Wiranagara and

the interpreter (in this fashion}:

"What do you say

about Pangeran Mangkubumi's mission?
For a long time he has not arrived (back).

2. If Pangeran Dipanagara
does not come here,

what will the end be?"

The Raden Adipati said:
"Stuff and nonsense,

if it is clear that the Pangeran
refuses to meet

with his brother

the Resident, it will be easy
for people to envisage battle.

3. (But) be patient for today,

if by six o'clock he has not arrived,
tomorrow morning report again

to choose those who will be sent

to invite the Pangeran.

(who are) courageous (and) very thorough,

exact (and) precise in affairs,

who can apply calmness and gentleness,

(but yet) stand firm in battle,

4. so that they cannot be refused

The Nayakas were all in agreement.

Now it was already a long time

that Pangeran Mangkubumi (had been gone)'*?.

In the meantime it was

six o'clock, the sun set,

(and) the Nayakas

agreed to depart (and) report again the following day
without awaiting a summons.

5. All the Nayakas left;

some rode on horseback

and (some) in carriages and bendis'*"

each returning home,

We do not tell of the night,-(but) in the morning
the Nayakas

came in to report (at the Residency),

namely, Raden Adipati Danurtja

Major Wiranagara and furthermore

Chevallier (and) the interpreter.

6. (The date was) Wednesday the fourth (of Besar) (20 July).
Mr. Smissaert said

to Secretary Chevallier:

"What is your advice?

The envoy to Tégalréa,

Pangeran Mangkubumi.

has not arrived.

What is your thought on the- matter?

Would it be appropriate to follow him up again.

(and if so) who should be sent?"

7. Secretary Chevallier said softly

to Raden Adipati Danurgja,

Interpreter Dietrée

and Raden Tuménggung

Major Wiranagara together:

"All of you consider

this question:

what should be proper

with regard to Pangeran Mangkubumi's mission?
Should he be followed up or not?"

8. The Raden Adipati spoke slowly:
"As concerns my own opinion,

it would be best to follow him up again.

The Resident agreed

with the proposal of the Raden Adipati.

He ordered

Mas Tuménggung

Sindunagara and

the Dutch orderlies to be summoned. They arrived before him
(and) were given a letter (of credence):

11. They were briefed completely
concerning the execution of their task

to examine truthfully.

The letter was received

(and) the Mas Turenggung left immediately,
the two Dutchmen

travelling with him.

Slow was the speech

of Pangeran Mangkubumi:

"Ah, my beloved nephew,

my coming (here)

(is because) I have been instructed to invite you
to the Residency, what is your wush

If you do not come,

13. Tégalréja will not fail straightway

to be visited by Dutch

and Javanese troops, (and) they will all
coerce you (by force of arms), my bov.

It will not fail to come to war

against the people of the whole state

of Yogya.

What will you do to protect yourself?

(For) I observe, boy, that you are still weak;
(and) do not have equipment.

14. - It is hard (and) difficult for a man to wage war,
one should not make light of it my boy;

clothes must be got together,

(and) first of all the army

must have enough food and victuals.

{And) they must be assured forgiveness

always.

Secondly (you must be) wealthy in money.

thirdly (possess) good weapons,

that is my view.

15. There is no lack of examples and precedents
in Java, boy, (for) many

have done something comparable

(and) have opposed their king.

In an earlier period, Pragola at Pathi!*

opposed your forefather

His Highness Sultan Agung.

The people of Pathi were murderously fought,
not one remained alive, great or small,

(and) Pathi was destroyed.

16. Your own great-grandfather,

His Highness the first Sultan of Yogya, (did it)
when he wished to oppose the Dutch

(and) be the enemy of Baron van ImhofP **.
Java was terror-stricken

(and) the Dutch (almost) destroyed.

In the end

your great-grandfather made peace

with the Dutch (and) received half the state.
That is why. my son.

17. whatever you may do, Lord,

don't go so far, boy, as to be the enemy

of the Dutch. It would be (too) heavy to bear.
And moreover your ancestor

who was raised formerly as Sultan

had already promised on oath

that he would not allow

the use of treacherous behaviour

to the Dutch." The Pangeran said this with tears
starting from his eyes.

18, - Pangeran Dipanagara said calmly:

"If you are afraid to oppose

the Dutch, from now on

once and for all become (my) enemy!"

Pangeran Mangkubumi was silent

observing his nephew's

great wrath.

He resigned himself to his fate, leaving everything to God.

Not long afterwards someone came to make an announcement;
performing a sembah before him:

19. - "Lord, there are visitors outside,

Mas Tuménggung Sindupraja!*®
accompanied by two Dutchmen."

The Pangeran said pleasantly:

"Summon them to come in immediately!"
He made a sembah in agreement (and) left.
Already (the guests) were ushered in.
Tumé&nggung Sindunagara

and the two Dutchmen sat down on chairs.
(Sindunagara) spoke slowly

20. with his hands clasped in front of him'":
"I have been sent by

Resident Smissaert, my son.

First, he gives

his greetings to Your Lordship

(and) secondly I

am instructed

to present you with a letter."

The letter was received (and) read attentively
right through to the end.

21. After it had been read, (Dipanagara) quickly
handed it over to his uncle,

saying slowly:

"Here my Lord!"

Pangeran Mangkubumi received

the letter. After he had read it,

he was startled at heart.

Pangeran Mangkubumi said:

"It is up to you what you write in reply,

choose (one of) the two courses."

22. Pangeran Dipanagara said calmly:
"Sindunagara, my reply is this;

tell the Resident

that as concerns his calling me,

even if he waits till the roads turn to mud!*",
under no circumstances would I be willing.. °

to enter the Residency.

If the Resident wants

to bring an army complete with weapons of war
to mistreat me,

23. no matter whether he orders or does not forbid (it),
life (and) death will certainly not occur

(for) they are at the discretion of the Lord Allah.

If Smissaert pretends

that he can ordain life and death

(and) not Allah the Almighty,

then in my view

the Dutch have evil hearts

(and) are not fitted to exercise law and justice.

(Go) quickly (and) tell that

24. - to the smooth bald-headed one''"! In my childhood
people used to make me afraid when giving an order,

(but) all this bragging

about going to war is just idle talk.

Now I am not cowed any more.

Quickly Sindunagara

tell him that I

will just await him here.

If it comes to battle the bald-headed one will be disappointed
if I am not present (too)!"

25. Both Dutchmen sat staring in amazement,

neither could speak.

Then Sindunagara swiftly

begged permission to depart.

Hurriedly they went on their way,

three in number inclusive of the Dutchmen.

On horseback hastening along

at a gallop, they soon arrived

at the (Residency) office. All the Nayakas were waiting,
Sindunagara spoke,

26. informing them about everything;

beginning, middle (and) end, nothing was omitted from
the Pangeran's replies.

All of them were brought to the knowledge

of the Resident, Mr. Smissacrt,

(who), when he heard the words

of the Mas Tumnenggung,

was exceedingly angry as though he had been slapped;
his face was hot, glowing with wrath,

(and) his heart was afire.

1. Hendrik Smissaert said

to the Raden Adipati:

""Now the wish

of Pangeran Dipanagara

is that I myself should command in battle,
for if I delegate it to any other person

it will bring disgrace upon the state."

2. Adipati Danuréja

said in a woeful tone:

"If it is possible. Sir.

be calm in your actions.

In war one cannot act hastily

for in the future in Yogya there would not
be anyone left alive.

3, - It is entirely up to you, Sir.

if you want to do battle in person.

making the impression of burning

to all the enemies in Tegalr¢ia.

The palace guard were commanded by him;

their lances (and) drums in good order.

12. Raden Wiranagara was at the rear.

The tread of the foot-soldiers who accompanied him sounded noisily:
They were about two hundred

carrying the insignia of his rank and ceremonial lances.

Behind them were the Government troops coming on in a body,

like a thick drove,

commanded by the Secretary,

13. Now we change the tale.

Pangeran Dipanagara had already: understood

that they (the Dutch and Javanese Government troops) wished to drive him away
from Tegalréja,

for they wore full royal battle array'**.

The Pangeran had given orders

to his whole army.

all wished to take part with their lord.
Their weapons were various
according to their personal tastes:

15. some (carried) dwarflike short spears,

others pointed bamboos, staves and slings.

The approximate number

of Dipanagara's men

was five hundred. All had been given invulnerability'®*,
(and) had been guaranteed that bullets could not strike;
the shot would (fall) short, or (go) too far,

16. Pangeran Dipanagara

was already clothed in the apparel of the Holy War'*";
the breeches, jacket

and head-dress were all white.

Hanging on his left hip were three krises

his horses were before him,

ceremonial lances to the right and left.

17. - All his wives and children

had been ordered to leave earlier

with the children and womenfolk of his retainers.
They went away together

to the hill of Sélarong!",

Now it is told how the Pangeran

had drawn up his troops.

18. - The men of the Dipanagaran

had already been stationed on the right and left wings;
all promised to attack together

like a nestful of eggs,

if (one) broke all would be crushed together.

Their unanimous intention

was to share the fortune of their lord.

19. - He gave instructions to the officers.

The Pangeran (prepared) to go away by himself "'.
In the van were those carrying slings,

(and those with) clubs and pointed bumboos

(and) wooden lances which served as pikes.

(Those with) rifles (and) bayonets were in the centre,
(and those with) pikes and spears at the back.

20. The Pangeran was in the rear
escorted by all his relatives of lower rank,

in number about

one hundred, (all) on horseback.

All one hundred had been trained (and) were invulnerable to attack,
no weapon was sharp enough (to wound them)

(and) they all bore pikes.

21. Pangeran Dipanagara

was riding a tall large chestnut horse

called Mitragna!"?.

(His servants) carried his ceremonial lances shoulder high

(and) his payung which was yellow with a golden top and borders!"3.
Outwardly the Pangeran

was like the prince of Dwarawati®*.

22. Both the Pangeran's horses

were led on each side in harness before him:

one was black with white fetlocks.
the second (was called) Dewadenta!"3,

23. We now change the tale again.
Raden Tuménggung Wiranagara was now
hastening along with his army.

They had almost reached Tegair&a

(and were) about half a league away'"®.
The palace guard of four brigades

were all musing in their hearts:

24. - 'What is the guilt of the Pangeran

that an expedition has been sent out as though for a man guilty of murder?
If we do not know his crime,

how can we want to fight (him)?"

So they stopped in a bunch in the middle of the road,

looking around to the rear

at all the officers.

25. Surabraja saw

that his comrades in the van were all breaking away,
(so) he put his horse into a gallop.

Surabraja (then) inquired

of the officers, (and) they said

that the halt in the march

(was caused) by the soldiers in the van

26. (who) wished to ascertain the offence

of the Pangeran on account of which he was being attacked.
Surabraja nodded

(and) said:

"Here I am still as perplexed as a young buffalo.

I do not differ from you.

Now my advice is;

27. come on! Let us refer for orders to

Raden Major Wiranagara.

It is easy for people to wage war

if they know the reason.

Lurahs, Lieutenants, Captains (and) superior officers
follow along behind me

and take care!

28. - What happened before

(was that) earlier Raden Major Wiranagara
did not consider good proposals:

he is overbearing, trying to be foremost,
Now if he does not heed us,

let us run amok together."

The officers answered in unison.

29. (Then) all the officers

gave the order to the Corporals

who passed it on to the soldiers.

The officers departed

all on horseback at full gallop.

Not long afterwards they. arrived before

the Raden Major, who was extremely taken aback.

30. Tuméenggung Wiranagara
said loudly: "What is the reason
you have turned back

all officers?"

Surabraja made a sembah (and) said calmly.
whilst still sitting on horseback:
"I inform you

31. that the reason the officers

have to wait upon you

is that all have (this question) to ask:
namely what was

the offence which has occasioned the attack
on Pangeran Dipanagara?

from your honoured self to the officers
(concerning) the real offence

of Pangeran Dipanagara,

so that we are not doubtful at heart
(and) even if we meet death

none of us will flee.

33. But if we are not informed

«bout the real offence of the Pangeran,
all the commanders

render up life (and) death

tand) even accept dismissal."

Raden Major Wiranagara,

when he heard the speech

34. - of Surabraja, was exceedingly angry.

The Raden Tuménggung flew out at him, pointing his finger!*";
"Eh Surabraja! If

you are afraid of death

don't go halfway, all at once become an enemy

(and) defect to Tegalréja,

at this very moment!

35. It would appear that you are carping!

Are you willing or not to carry out

my orders,

whether they be right or wrong?

Stop this asking whether it is correct or false!

Did it in any way interest you

before at the Residency? (Why) did you not inquire (then)?

36. - I also have authority

to decide on life (and) death.in the ranks,

Whoever opposes my order

will not fail to be torn limb from limb by me.""

Raden Major Wiranagara laid hold threateningly of his short spear
(and) pointed it precisely.

Surabraja was immediately on his guard.

37. All the Lieutenants (and) Captains,

who were together forty in number,

drew their pistols

(and) all aimed together.

The Raden Major was on the alert (and) took flight,

spurring on his horse.
He was followed up from behind.

38. He was fired on by pistols (but) not hit.
Surabraja called out to him, saying:

""Why are you fleeing so fast

Major? Have you no shame

that you talk rot like a clown?

It is as though you should be respected

because you claim to be a descendant of Surapati'"®,

39. - a descendant of the enemy of the Dutch;

You want to show off your official zeal by adhering closely to the Government.
Come back, you fool!"

Major Wiranagara

whipped the ears of his horse
(and) said grumbling:

"They would serve a madman!"

40. Surabraja then

stopped pursuing the Major (and) straightway
discussed with his comrades

the officers (thus):

"What do you think my-comrades?

Let us go over to the Pangeran

and throw in our lot with him!

41. If I do not go over,

your Major will not fail to find a cat s-paw.

A rotter may be expected

always to put

his comrades in the wrong by serutinising them day and night.
He does not count the spilling of blood,

what he strives for is only the profit."

42. All the officers spoke

to Surabraja in these words:

"We are indeed very much in agreement

with your plans, Sir.

In life (or) death, provided that it is a descendant of Mataram who is in command,
the four brigades of soldiers

will all go over."

43. They had already entered Tegalréja,

(and) it was reported (to Dipanagara) that the palace guard had come over
(and) had surrendered with all their arms.

The Pangeran was greatly pleased.

The troops were placed on the right and left (wings),

(but) the position of the ranks was unchanged,

(and) their weapons were at the ready.

44. We tell of the one who had fled:
Major Wiranagara arrived at the Residency,
then entered in a Auster

(and) sat down.

Adipati Danurgia was amazed to see him,
as was Mr. Smissacrt.

He was invited to report about

45. the reason he had fled.

He spoke clearly without omissions (or) additions.
(Then) Mr. Smissaert said:

"What now Raden Adipati?

Who should follow up the expedition

of Mr. Chevallier to Tegalréja

to reinforce him in battle?"

46. The Adipati said:

"With your permission, I will invite

younger brother Wiranagara to return,

and furthermore accompanied by

an Outer Bupati'"®, who is to go with him;

Raden Ranadiningrat

together with his followers who-have been called up."

47. - Resident Smissaert

was very much in agreement with the proposal of the Raden Adipati.
The latter was instructed to order

Raden Ranadiningrat

to command the preparation of his followers

to go along to Tégalréja

with Major Wiranagara.

48. - Raden Ranadiningrat

gave the order to prepare for battle

to his Kliwons, Mantris

and blood relations.

They arrived in front of the Residency on horseback

with Major Wiranagara

(also) accompanied by his relations who had been called up.

49. Not long afterwards they departed.
Raden Ranadiningrat in the van

leading the army.

Major Wiranagara

was at the rear. half-hearted and sullen.
He attracted much attention on the road
(and) some whispered,

50. nudging at their friends:
"How is it that the Raden Major
is so different from his normal self,
hale and hearty like a Dutchman?
Now he looks so truckling

and just as in the wayang pura
(he is) like Sang Aria Sangkuni'*°1"

S1. Now we shall speak of the arrival

of Raden Ranadiningrat and hisarmy.

They came before

the commander Chevallier

and were directed to a position apart

from the Dutch soldiers

in order to close in from behind, (and he said):

52. "And Major Wiranagara,

be careful not to be separated from your troop!®'

The Raden Tumenggungs acquiesced.

They both took their leave

(and) turned about north-west in the direction of Kuncen'*'.

in order to keep watch/at the back of the compound;

for the one who was to make a frontal attack on (Dipanagara's) residence

53. - was the commander Chevallier

who led the white troops.

They departed with a roar,

like a land-slide.

The drums (and) flutes made a confused noise,
und the neighing of the horses

was like a rain-squall.

54. Those in the van arrived
outside Tégalréia first.

We change to tell of the Pangeran.
He took command of his army.

There was a confused sound of cheering (and) the hendhe sounded continuously '*".
Those with slings were in the front,
(and) both sides had engaged in battle.

55. The infantry fired volleys noisily,

like a thousand claps of thunder crashing close at hand in drizzle;
the cannons sounded thunderously

us though the earth was splitting asunder,

(and) the bullets fell like dense showers of rain.

The army of the Dipanagaran

slipped into the smoke of the guns

56. - wielding their slings for all they were worth,

(and) the sound of the rifles was like the popping of maize.
The corpses were piled in heaps,

both friend and foe.

People received all kinds of wounds:

some had their shoulders slashed

and (others) their necks cut through.

57. The battle was closely fought:

it was impossible to make the Javanese move their ground.
The sound of (weapons) clashing was everywhere:

pikes struck swords,

(but) no one on the two sides uttered their fear,

There were heavy lasses amongst friends and foes,

(but) the Javanese were being overwhelmed in battle.

58. Pangeran Dipanagara

watched his army being heavily defeated
{and) he angrily urged them forward.
He had the cavalry

of the palace guard led by Surabraja
summoned before him (and said):

"Ah, Surabraja. immediately

59. give assistance in battle

in the Holy War against the unbelievers!"

Surabraja obeyed

(and) ordered on his companions.

The palace guard of four brigades'*", attacked together
like the dash of waves on the ocean,

they advanced evenly on a united front.

60. - The Government force was still pugnacious.
firing volleys time and again.

The palace guard fought

ferociously like tigers

who were attempting to devour a huge snake.
Surabraja ran riot

like a Wajo pirate sailing for Java !*=.

61. The infantry fought

with ever increasing fierceness, many received wounds.
Moreover two were killed,

speared through by Surabraja.

The corpses were carried away to the rear.

(When) Mr. Chevallier saw it,

he was angry (and) would not retreat.

CANTO IX

1. With rage Secretary Chevallier saw

that many infantrymen bore wounds

because of the fierce attack

of the palace Mantri'®*, Surabraja.

He (Chevallier) felt spurred on to more drastic action.
His eyebrows bristled

(and) his eyes became flaming red.

2. The soldiers were urged to clinch the battle
by the commander Chevallier, j
The gunners were drawn up

(and) the cannon

All the infantrymen were ordered to draw back
(and) come before

the commander Chevallier.

3. Chevallier (then) gave the orders to make the cannon
roar in turn

like bolts of lightning.

The cannons thundered terribly

(and) the men of the Dipanagaran were daunted.

The vanguard split open

(and) the rear crowded together.

4. The palace guard of four brigades were entirely scattered.
They retreated (and) came close to their Lord.

Now, the Pangeran,

seeing his troops (retreat).

was in a towering rage.

Surabraja
was summoned to appear before him.

5. (and he said): "Eh you, Surabraja! How comes it you are running?
I ordered you to wage the Holy War

for the furtherance of the religion '*

of the Holy Prophet.

If you are afraid to meet death,

why did you

(and) your companions come over?

6. Remember that you are turncoats!
You were not steadfast in battle;

you just pretended to fight.

(But) don't just act contemptibly;

if you are not brave enough to die

in the Holy War,

go back to the unbelievers!"

7. When he heard the words of the Pangeran,
Surabraja and furthermore

(all) his comrades,

the officers.

forty in number, let out a war-cry,

twisted their spears

(and) rushed away together.

8. The rank and file were all left behind
by the officers.

(As for) Surabraja

he rushed around drunk with battle;

the tilting of his pike caused loud cracks,
(and) in the Dutch army

many bore wounds.

9. Warily the Secretary looked on.

He ordered the war-alarm to be sounded
(and) the cannon to be positioned;

they were sighted carefully

{and) were ranged exactly.

They fired thunderously:

the shots like flashing lightning.

10. Surabraja was hit direct (and) his chest split up,

his severed arm was almost hanging off,
and his horse

and Wiranagara

were awaiting him on the road

with intent to block his passage.

The Pangeran had already ordered

the palace army of four

brigades to come forward.

17. (He said): "Hey! Come on men of the Katanggung.
Brajataka and (you) too

Jaga-upa and

fellows of the Mandrapratamal

18. - Indeed, I myself will now go to it,
attacking fiercely in battle

In fact, what 1 have been waiting for
is to face him (in battle) on the road,
no matter who dies.

19. - If I fight that Wiranagara
let no one come to my aid,
just yell out (encouragement)
as though at a cockfight!"

All the officers agreed.

The Pangeran immediately
drew his kris,

20. a stabbing sword which was an heirloom from his father,
His Highness the third Sultan'"*.

When all was ready

they departed, the war-alarms sounding

(and) the bendhe being struck.

The Pangeran

was in the van by himself;

The Pangeran rode up bravely,

fighting frenziedly,

using his sword as a defence.

23. Everywhere there was the clash (and) swish of weapons tearing down.
The Pangeran was on the look out

only for Wiranagara.

For long he did not encounter him,

(but) no sooner had he heard his voice.

than he rushed forward in order

to slash him swiftly with his sword.

24. - But instead, Wiranagara's spear

was cut in half by one ferocious blow

which cleft straight through to his horse,

both ears of which were/opped off.

The Pangeran cried: "Death to him!

This fool of a Major \

will not fail to be chopped into pieces by me!"

brigades stood firm in the struggle,
engaged in a heavy exchange of firing
and stabbing.

He encountered

Secretary Chevallier:

CANTO X

I.. Raden Ranadiningrat

spoke to the commander (thus):

"Sir, as to what happened to me".

when I was at Kuncen with my troops,

just at seven o'clock

the Pangeran and his army

attacked our lines.

I fought against them in battle,

the fighting was lively, many enemies and companions were wounded.

2, - We were separated (when) the moon set.

It became pitch dark,

so that we could not distinguish enemies from friends.

Both sides retreated.

I received a wound,

I know not where the enemy came from:

The Pangeran and his army,

the survivors from those killed,

went to the south-west sounding the war-alarms along the road.

3. Where the Pangeran was heading
I am not exactly clear,

(but) it is up to you; Sir,

if you wish to dispatch spies."

The commander Chevallier

replied in a friendly fashion:

he took off his hat.

(and) thanked him three times.

He summoned an orderly courier.

4. Upon (the courier's) arrival, he received
instructions to track down

the Pangeran and his army

(and find out) where they were halting on the way,
(inquiring) from village to village.

The courier agreed.

Raden Ranadiningrat

and Major Wiranagara

gave him two Mantri scribes as companions.

5. They departed from his presence
hastening along on horseback.

We do not describe their journey.
They made haste (and) arrived

at Ambark¢tawang!**.

they went south (and) soon came
to the village of Bantul"®", (where) they asked softly,
(and) were told that (Dipanagara and his army) were at Sélarong,

6. where his troops were being drawn up in a half-circle

at the hill of Sélarong.

The information was written down

by both the Maniri scribes.

Afterwards the three messengers

went away on horseback, racing fast.

Their journey is not described,

(but) on their arrival at Tegalréja

they went straight up (to Chevallier) without awaiting a summons.

7. They offered the written report
of their mission.

It was received and read

by the commander Chevallier.

He was quite glad at heart

(and) drew up a letter intended

for Mr. Smissaert.

Now the letter was finished.

The Secretary ordered

8. - Raden Ranadiningrat,

Major Wiranagara

and the Dutch troops,

(who) all received the command

to depart forthwith.

The property of the Pangeran,

which had been left behind, was carried.

to the capital.

Nothing remained, everything was taken'**.

9. Immediately they prepared to depart,

with a confused noise the war-alarms sounded,
drums and gongs were struck in answer

(and) cymbals reverberated with a loud clash,
flutes trilled everywhere

(and) the drums thumped thunderously
joining in with the braying of trumpets.

The troops were marched out in columns

like the sound of small cannon firing 9,

Those who were in the van,

in a throng, were the Dutch troops.

The commander was in the centre

(and) the Javanese troops were in the rear

11. and Major Wiranagara,

who were riding behind them.

We do not describe their journey.

The troops in the van arrived

(and) drew themselves up in front of the Residency house.
The sides of the road were crowded,

each unit drawn up apart.

The Secretary

then entered the Residency.

12. Both the Raden Turnénggungs

followed suit (and) went into the Residency,

and all the battle commanders

went along to report;

Just at that time

13. Sindunagara, Mandura

They had all come to report

as well as the relatives of the Sultan.

Only Pangeran Mangkubumi,

Pangeran Suryadipura

(and) Pangeran Adiwinata (were absent).

Together they had followed (Dipanagara) to Sélarong,

to Mr. Smissaert.
The successive events of the battle
were described in the document.

15. (When) it had been read

and the contents of the writing clear to him,
Resident Smissaert's

eyes glowed with anger,

he boiled with rage, his tecth gnashed together (and)
he slapped his thighs.

The letter, though already clear,

was read through three times,

then handed on to Pangeran Paku Alam.

16. - The Bupatis and the (Sultan's) relations
read it in turns.

After they had all finished,

Mr, Hendrik

Smissaert said calmly;

"What is your opinion,

all of you, family relations (of the Sultan)
and Bupatis?"

Adipati Danur&ja said politely:

17. "As for me, I would say

that if you wish that Pangeran Dipanagara
be attacked

at Sélarong, it is not far

(and) it would not be hard

to fight him. (But) the best is

that you, Sir, dispatch a messenger

to Batavia

to inform His Excellency

18. - the Governor-General,

und furthermore send a messenger

to Surakarta

(to) Mr. MacGillavry,

the Resident who has authority

to Surakarta (and) Batavia®®".

And, furthermore, there is the news

that Pangeran Dipanagara has already

made an agreement with a man from Magélang

who is prepared to destroy the Government (forces),

namely Wiryawijaya, whose house is in the village of Bendha®"".

20. - Mention in the letter

that even though he is a commoner,

he has undertaken to overrun Magélang

(and) start hostilities against the Government."
Resident Smissaert

was glad at heart (and) nodded.

The Nayakas

and the (Sultan's) relations,

all agreed unanimously.

21. Mr, Smissaert had

the letters written. Not long (and) they were ready;

the postilions were summoned

(and) after they had received their instructions,

they both departed.

The one bound for Surakarta

went away fast on horseback,

and the one to S&marang

made great speed, not even being allowed to stop for an hour.

22. The meeting dispersed.

the (Sultan's) relatives (and) the Bupatis

all returned to their own homes.

We now change the tale again

(and) talk of Sélarong.

Pangeran Dipanagara had already

summoned his scribes.

Both appeared before him;

they bore the names of Ngabehi Sastraprayitna

23. and Sastradiméja.

The Pangeran said in a friendly fashion:

Raden Adipati Aria Cakranagara®**

had come in.

5. The officers sat down in a row.

When they were seated in an orderly fashion,
Mr. Domis spoke calmly

to the Secretary saying:

"I have received letters,

two express letters,

please consider them.

6. (One is from) Mr. Hendrik MacGillavry,
the Resident of Surakarta,

the other letter

(is from) Hendrik Smissaert in Yogya.

The contents of the letters

both should be directly communicated

to His Excellency the Governor-General."

7. Mr. Servatius**" received

the letters from Yogya

and Surakarta,

and was much alarmed learning

their contents.

He read them over three times

and their purport was well understood.

8. - The letters were quickly handed over
to the interpreter,

(who), after he had finished reading them,
handed the letters over

to Raden Adipati

Aria Cakranagara.

When he had finished reading them,

9. they went from hand 'to hand among the officers"*"
and all the council,
After they had all read them,

Mr. Domis said

to Raden Adipati

Aria Cakranagara:

"What is your advice Raden Adipati?

10. What is the custom of the Javanese officials
if there is such a case?

It is up to you, Raden (Adipati),

to send out orders

to the Javanese in the Semarang

area and the environs

which are under the authority of S¢marang***."

11, (Raden) Adipati

Aria Cakranagara acquiesced (saying):

"But indeed my request

is that before there are instructions,

from his Excellency (the Governor-General),
all four directions

at Semarang must be guarded.

12. The Javanese must mount guard,

but the commanders there

should be Dutch preferably.

The armed men should be on guard day (and) night
(and) patrol the main roads.

If there are any people passing

who are of a suspicious nature, they must be seized;

13. (but) if the people circulating

carry a letter showing their destination (i.¢. a pass)",
let them go on their way. a

Sir, it is customary with the Javanese,

that small in war is the fairness;

ruses, deceit

and artifices are used first.

14. (The Javanese) are not like Government people
who are straightforward night (and) day

(and) are happy if in the thick of battle,

(and) defeated (or) victorious remain in order

and do not practise artifices.

But with the Javanese it is customary

to use

15. Secondly, I feel

that Pangeran Dipanagara

is no rebel with a beggar's rattle*"®.
With cattle he might be compared to
a descendant of a wild bui".

If his courage is aroused

he would rather die than be bound

16. (and) implore mercy. But the other,

Pangeran Mangkubumi,

it could well be that his heart is weak.

Though both are of Mataram descent'®,

he is different from his nephew.

With low persons such as I

(he could be called) lacking backbone and faint-hearted."

17. Resident Domis was content at heart
when he heard the speech

of Raden Adipati

Aria Cakranagara.

He gave it careful consideration

and much of it looked attractive.
Immediately he gave the order

18. - to all the officers

in command of the Javanese troops

(in the pay of) the Government, that it would be best,
if in turns,

they mounted guard outside the town.

The Adipati detailed

the north coast Tunénggungs to

19. mount guard in all four directions,

at every five leagues,

with one Regent** in command;

accompanied by a Dutchman.

They swiftly prepared to depart.

To the east and south

(and) to the west, (the area) was full of guards.

20, Then Mr. Domis immediately

called a courier

to take a letter

post-haste to

Jakarta,

destined for the Governor(-General)
(and) the Council of the Indies at Batavia.

from Surakarta. Both

were enclosed in the same parcel
in order to be taken to Jakarta.

on horseback at full stretch.

22. We do not describe his journey,
(but) change the tale.

At that time in Yogyakarta

Resident Smissaert

was in audience with the Bupatis.
The Bupatis were facing him,
(namely) Raden Adipati Danurtia

23. and Major Wiranagara,
Tuméenggung Danunagara,

Sindunagara

and Mas Tum&nggung Mandura,.'
Chevallier (and) the interpreter.

The Resident's heart

was sad like torn up cémpaka flowers",

24. and Secretary Chevallier
was visibly uneasy in his heart.
The interpreter Dietrée

was in a perpetual panic
thinking of all his mistakes,
all kinds of wrong-doings
which he had done formerly.

 

25. When he balanced them up he was fearful;

considering that the well ordered state

of Yogya was heading for destruction.

He was saddened (and) shuddered, but did not show it

to the public. (His secrets) had been revealed

(and) made apparent before his numerous enemies.

He was broken-hearted, overwhelmed (and) in a desperate state.

26. Resident Smissaert said

to Raden Adipati

Danuréja, speaking softly:
"What do you advise

2. dia memanggil ketua dari Kapedhak.
Sang Pangeran bersabda dengan lemah-lembut:
"Siapa yang membuat
bangunan disini?"
Yang diranya menyembah (dgn berkata):
"Dulu seorang yang disuruh
oleh Raden Adipati Danureja
dengan kerani dari pejabat (Residen), Gusti,
yang dipimpin dua tukang jalan Belanda.

3. Mereka tidak mengindahkan perintah-perintah saya,
tapi dengan paksa memasang tonggak-tonggak."
Pangeran Dipanagara
sangat marah di hati
(dan) menyuruh supaya tonggak-tonggak dibongkar
semuanya, jangan sampai ada yang ketinggalan.
Para Magersari dan Kapedhak
berduyun-duyun membongkar (tonggak-tonggak) bersama,
bertaboran, sehingga habis semua.

4. Waktu didengarkan oleh
Setiausaha
Chevallier bahwa Pangeran
Dipanagara sudah membongkar

semua tonggak-tonggak,

dia berpakaian, (naik) kereta (dan) melaporkan diri
ke bangunan keresidenan.

Hendrik Smissaert baru saja

sedang duduk di kursi di'serambi.timur.

5. Dia sedang menulis di suatu meja kecil
(dan) terkejut atas kedatangan
Tuan Chevallier. Dia (Chevallier) sudah duduk
di mukanya (dan) bersabda perlahan-lahan
dengan agak gugup dan tergagap,
sedang topinya di bawah ketiak:
"Saya ingin memberi tahu
bahwa semua conggak-tonggak
sepanjang (calon jalan) di Tegalreja sudah dibongkar

6. oleh Pangeran Dipanagara.
Tidak ada satupun yang masih berditi.
Apalagi tonggak-tonggak

sudah habis dibongkar semua."

Hendrik Smissaert waktu mendengar

laporan Chevallier,

membanting penanya, memukul pahanys,

matanya kelihatan merah (dan) kedua keningnya berdiri.

. Tuan Smissaert berkata:

"Heh Chevallier, saya menganggap
bahwa Pangeran Dipanagara

tidak dapat diperlakukan dengan baik.
Sudah lama saya melihat

bahwa semua pikirannya kelihatan anch.
Dia sedang mencari alasan

sebab mau melawan Kompeniy

jadi tonggak-tonggak digunakan sebagai alasan.

Dia sedang menyembunyikan sesuatu (walaupun) dengan rerang-terangan;
dia membungkuk ke bawah tapi dilibat. Dia memberi kesan

dari seorang wiku-endhog (pandita palsu),

di dalam berisi kuning.

Selama saya menjadi

Residen tindakan dan

tingkah-laku Pangeran itw

{menunjukkan) bahwa dia tidak suka dengan kami.

Dia hanya berpura-pura gemar agama

dan sering pergi untuk bertapa.

Dia erat sekali dengan orang ulama;

kehormatannya sebagai seorang satria sudah hilang

sebab dia sudah menerima kehormatan orang ulama.

Dia sendiri tidak sadar

bahwa Seri Sultan masih muda.

Mengapa dia tidak ikut sedih hati

atas kekacauan negara?

Dia (merencanakan) mau mogok dengan pemerintah Hindia-Belanda.

Tapi pasti tidak akan mampu

kalau dia mau menentang Kompeni

(dan) memusuhi (pemerintah) Hindia-Belanda.
Saya sudah lihat bahwa Sang Pangeran

belum punya perajurit-perajurit

dan perlengkapan-perlengkapan untuk pertempuran teratur.
Dia berteman dengan sampah masyarakyat

(dan) menyombong diri untuk mengajak perang,

tapi kaum ulama itu, apa harganya?

Eh, Chevallier, besok

memberi perintah supaya tonggak-tonggak dipasang lagi

oleh anak-anak Macanan dari Danurejan

dengan dua kerani (kantor Residen)

(dan) para tukang jalan Belanda.

Satu ronggakpun tidak boleh ditinggalkan

(tapi) memasang (tonggak-tonggak) di tempat-tempat yang lama,
jangan sampai ada berubshan apapun dengan dulu."

Tuan Chevallier mengemukakan perserujuannya,

turun dari kursi,

naik kereta (dan) pulang.

Malamnya tidak diceritakan.

Waktu pagi dia mengirim urusan uncuk memanggil
Raden Adipati

Danureia. Setelah (Danureja) datang,

dia diberi perintah

(dan) dipesan untuk pasang tonggak-tonggak lagi.
Raden Adipati Danureja kemudian memerintah

pegawainya, ketua dati Macanan,

yang namanya Macan Sembawa (sebagai berikut):
"Heh, kamu, Macan Sembawa

dan semua sahaba-sababstmu;

memasang tonggak-tonggak

di Tegalreja (lagi) dengan kuat."

Macan Sembawa menyembab,

mengemukakan persetujuan (dan) langsung berangkat
dipimpin olch kerani dan tukang-tukang jalan.

Dia mengambil seorang ketua kampung dengan para askar,
tiga puluh orang dari (golongan) Macanan

Mereka dipermanjakan dalam tingkah-lakunya.

Tugas mereka adalah untuk meronda pada waktu malam

Orang-orang jahat diawasi olch mereka

(dan) waktu siang hari mereka melarang

orang-orang (yang bermain) dadu, keplek dan kubuk.
Sebenarnya mereka sudah berpengalaman,

kalau tanda bahaya dibunyikan

waktu kentong pertama (berbunyi), seorang Macanan datang.

(Dan) waktu genap kentong ketiga

Macanan-Macanan (mulai) turun

seperti hujan rintik-rintik dan anak-anake Macanan sekali-kali
siap untuk mengumpulkan bukti-bukti,

beriang hati,

seperti mereka sedang mengharap menemukan

dinar-dinar mas beratnya sedacin.

Waktu mereka sudah tiba di

Tegalreja (mereka) memasang tonggak-tonggak bersama.

(Tonggak-tonggak) diaturkan lagi dengan tali
sepanjang (calon jalan) seperti dulu,

calon lama tidak diubsh.

Yang memasang ronggak-tonggak beramai-ramai.
Waktu Sang Pangeran mendengar

suara rioh dan ramai itu,

dia langsung memerintah (seorang) untuk menyelidiki.
Yang diutus berkata dengan lemab-lembut,

sambil menyembah, miukanya seperti menyentuh tanah:

"Gusti, suara ramai itu

(dikarenakan) para tukang jalan Belanda

dengan orang-orang Macanan

dari Danurejan yang mengiringi mereka.

Mereka sedang memasang tonggak-tonggak bersama,
dengan diaturkan dengan tali sepanjang (calon lama).
(Tonggak-tonggak) yang sudah dibongkar

dulu, sekarang ditanam lagi."

Pangeran Dipanagara berkata dengan keras:

162

Babad Dipanagara

19. "Heh, anak-anakku, para Kapedhak
dan Magersari, segera
membongkar dari belakang semua (tonggak-tonggak)
yang sudah ditanam (lagi).
Jangan sampai ada satupun yang ketinggalan.
Jika kamu sampai dipukul
membalas pukulan itu.
Kalau kamu ditusuk,
membalas tusuken itu. Demikianiah pesan saya!

20. Jikalau Sang Residen dan Danureja (sendiri)
yang mengerjakan pemasangan tonggak-tonggak itu,
saya sendiri yang akan membongkarnya.
Lihat saja kelak."

Mereka mengadakan persetujuan (dan) berangkat semua.
Para Kapedhak dan Magersari

2. oleh orang-orang Dipanagaran.
Akan buat apa kamu? Apakah kamu akan melawan mereka?
Atau melaporkan (itu dulu)

"Eb, Tuan-Tuanku, tukang jalan,
apabila belum pasti kita

Macan Sembawa bersabda keras:
"Kawan-kawanku semua

ada yang memegang kayu jari atau glugu,
yang lain mencabut kayy jarak
empat batang diikat jadi satu.

. Sebagian memegang batang-batang pohon pinang
lainnya meruntas cabang beringin

Para Macanan memukul

bertubi-tubi tapi tidak dengan terarur.

Terdengar suara mendesir-desir dari pukul-pukulan
yang ditangkis oleh Kapedhak

dan askar-askar Magersari dengan gagah berani.

Oleh sebab mereka sering dipukul

yang menghindarkan (bertindak) dengan tenang (dan) pantas,
berkat mereka sudah dilatih.

Magersari (dan) Kapedhak

sudah diajar oleh orang Bugis untuk memegang pemnukul,
menghindarkan diri (dan) berpencak dengan cara Cina,

jadi mereka tidak kekurangan kepantasan.

Para Macanan tidak

pernah belajar hal-ihwal perang.

Mereka kenyang puji-pujian dan sanjungan.

Latihan sehari-hari mereka

adalah untuk memukul para pencuri atau perampok
yang diikat tersungkur di atas bangku;

(waktu itu) mereka memukul bertubi-tubi.

Pentungnya para Macanan kerap jatuh

terpelanting (dan) terpencar. Mereka dibalas sampai, pingsan:
ada yang dipukul di leher belakang,

yang lain di kening,

yang lain lagi dipukul di kedua belah kakinya sehingga putus,
(ada) yang dipukul di-tulang

schingga berbaring (di tanah) pincang (dan) timpang.

Waktu Macan Sembawa melihat

kawan-kawannys askar banyak yang mandi darah,

dia mengamuk bermati-matian (dan) menyerbu (dengan)
memegang kerisnya terhunus,

menggosok dadanys, mengerutkan (bibir-bibirnya dan) menggigit misainya,
(serta berteriak-reriak); "Mari, orang-orang Dipanagaran,
lekaslah mundur!

Agaknya kamu sekalian belum mendengar berita

bahwa saya seorang pilih tanding (dan)
ketua penjahat gerajul dari Kedu

dari (orang-orang) penjabat di Parakan:
(saya) tidak mempan serangan senjata tajam.
Kalian pasti tidak

cukup kuat melawan saya!"

Para Magersari dan Kapedhak

berteriak bersama: "Awas kawan-kawan!
Jangan menarik keris!

Macan tinggal seekor,

meskipun berjalur-jalur kalau dipukul pasti binasa.

Tapi jangan sampai kurang teliti
pukulaamu harus tepat!"

Macan Laut memohon belas kasihan
dengan merengek: "Mau apa dari saya?"
Pandangannya beralih-alib,

tubuhnya gemetar,

belakangnya bergoyang-goyang (dan) kentut-kentut berbunyi dengan terus-menerus.

Dia menyumpah berkali-kali;
"Saya bukan orang Macanan!"

Para Kapedhak dan Magersari
menjawab dengan kasar: "Bohong kamu!
Pakaianmu masih sempurna:

bajumu dan seluarmu bercorak

(kain) bintulu merh, dan kerismu
sarungaya gayaman

dengan ukiran cara Bali.

Kalau kamu mengaku bukan Macanan,
saya akan mengambil kerismu dan bajumu,
kain kepalamu (berwarna) ungu

dengan kainmu!"

Macan Laut mengaduh

dan mengucapkan rangawut (doa) tiga kali
(dan berkata): "Silahkan ambilnya!"

Dalam batinnya Macan Laut bersumpah:
'Kelak anak dan cucu saya
hingga tuju keturunan

167

Indonesian Malay Translation

bila sedang maju ke medan perang

jangan sampai menghinggapi kemilikan para pakaiannya lawan,
hidup atau mati,

di medan perang jangan memikirkan.'

25. Keris, kain, baju
dan kain kepala semua diserahkan.
(Macan Laut) lalu menangis dan kakinya diinjak-injakkan tanah dengan keras,
tapi dia tidak dipukul.
Dengan rambut terurai, dia berteriak sepanjang jalan.
Para Magersari dan Kapedhak
gembira hati melibat dukacitanya.

CANTO IV

L. Selanjutaya diceritakan lagi
tentang Pangeran Dipanagara.
Dia sedang menonton, waktu
berada diatas panggungan
di Tegalreja,
pertempuran (dan) pukul-memukulan
antara Kapedhak dan Macanan.

2. Macanan sudah kalgh
(dan) melarikan diri. Banyak yang menderita luka-luka:
ada yang (punya) kaki patah,
Lurah Macan Sembawa
didukung oleh kawannya
dua orang. Dia masih pingsan:
Sang Pangeran gembira melihatnya.

3. Dia tertawa kecil (dengan) menutup bibirnya,
(lantas) memanggil abdi pengiring
dua orang, yang diperintahkan
untuk memanggil para Kapedhak dan
Magersari (supaya menghadap Pangeran)
(dengan berkata): "Semua! Jangan ada yang ketinggalan!"
Dua-duanya sudah berangkar.

4. Setelah datang semua, mereka duduk bersaf-saf (dan)
Sang Pangeran bersabda perlahan:
"Saya sangat berterima kasih
kepada kalian (dan bersyukur)

168

wa

Babad Dipanagara

bahwa tidak ada yang mati."
Sang Pangeran lalu mengambil
wang Inggris dari sebuah dulang.

Mereka semua dianugerahi (hadiah),

setiap satu orang lima reyal,

Lurah (dan) Ketua Kampong tidak dibeda-bedakan,
hadiahnya sama rata.

Diceritakan selanjutnya

tentang para tukang jalan yang sedang berlari

dan para Macanan tiga puluh orang.

Waktu mereka (sudah) datang di bangunan keresidenan,
mereka memasuki halamannya.

Berderam-deram suaranya

bagaikan hatimau mengaum.

Hendrik Smissaert dan

Chevallier hatinya gelissh

(dan mereka) memanggil tukang jalan.

. Mereka maju sedang topinya diimpit di bawah ketiak

(dan) mereka melaporkan dari awal

sampai alchir.

Laporannya dari tukang jalan

tidak ada yang kurang.

Tuan Smissaert dan Chevallier setelah
mendengar (laporannya itu) meajadi-amat marab.

Gigi berkerot-kerot dan

matanya merah melotot,

kepalanya menggeleng-geleng

(dan) bulu keningnya berdiri.

Andaikata Tuan Smissaert

bertubuh tinggi dan besar

dia bageikan raja raksasa dari Ngalengka

waktu mendengar (laporan) matinya

raksasa Ari Nglebur Gangsa (Kumbakarna).
Tetapi harus ditambah perbandingan yang lain,
sebab dia (Smissaert) tubuhnya pendek,

kecil dan kurang bagus;

sedang perutnya bergantung

seperti jin Sang Pulunggana

169

Indonesian Malay Translation

. pada waktu mendukung Somba menjadi pencuri,
(dia) masuk keraton Ngastina
(dan) bersembunyi dalam kendi potol,
(tapi) dapat diketahui oleh anak Arjuna
dari kayangan,
(namanys) Bambang Wilugangga. Dia sudah tahu
bahwa Pulunggana sedang bersembunyi

. di dalam sebuah kandang itek
di kendi yang rosak.
(Sekarang) inilah contohnya
untuk Tuan Chevallier. Dia bagaikan
anak dari Arjuna
berwujud raksasa dari gunung
namanya jin Jayawigena,

. yang sedang mabok (buah) gayam lantas tertidur
di tengah hutan,
Begitulah perbandingan
yang terlalu panjang kalau diceritakan (dengan lengkap).
Seketika sudah disuruh
tiga orang kerani berlari-lari: (yang satu)
memanggil Raden Adipati

. Danureja; yang satu memanggil
Tumenggung Wiranagara,
yang satu lagi memanggil Tuan Dietree.
Dengan tergesa-gesa mereka datang
menghadap (di muka) Tuan Smissaert.
Tiga-tiganya memberi salam
dan semua duduk dengan ceratur.

. (Setelah) Raden Adipati (Danureja) melihat
askar-askar Macanan berserak-serak (di halaman)
(dan mendengar) jerit-jeritan dan sambat-sambatan,
dia mengutuskan seorang Mantri peratua
(namanya) Ngabehi Wiraprana
yang diperintch untuk membawa (mereka)
pulang kembali ke Danurejan.

. Tuan Smissaert bersabda dengan tenang:
"Raden Adipati Danureja

bagaimana pendapatmu?

Pangeran Dipanagara (sudah) banyak
menghina says.

Dia (sama sekali) tidak memikirkan pemerintah (Hindia-Belanda)
(dan) tidak menurut haluan negara, ~

(tapi hanya) mengikuti keinginan diri sendiri.

Sedang perasaan saya,

andaikan api,

jika tidak dipadamkan dengan berani

boleh jadi berkobar-kobar."

Tuan Setiausaha bersabda:

"Benar Kanjeng Tuan

Residen, saya setuju.

Pangeran Dipanagara

(barus) segera ditangkap

(dan) diasingkan kepada suatu tempat di seberang."
Wiranagara berkata

kepada Kanjeng Raden Adipati (Danureja):
"Kyai Lurah, bagaimana pendapatmu?
Apakeh seperti Chevallier?"

Sang Raden Adipati berkata:

"Kalau masih menjadi pembicaraan

seratus ribu kali, saya tidak akan mEngamu."
Kanjeng Tuan Residen

Smissaert lantas berkata:

"Sang Adipari bagaimana

yang (harus) menjadi cadangan,

sebab sekarang sudah terang

bahwa Pangeran Dipanagara

tidak menyayangi negara dan ratunya."
Raden Adipati Danureja

berkata: "Jika diperkenankan

saya akan mengirim utusan

dengan surat.

Para Panewu dan Mantri akan diutus

di bawah kekuasaan Surakarta:
Tidak boich dipandang ringan.
Sudah adat kebiasaan

kalau membuat jalan
(bahwa itu) dikerjakan bersama-sama.

. Kedua negara, Yogya dan

Surakarta, tidak boich

kalau kurang selaras (dan) rukun

(sebab) sebarang pekerjaan tidak akan berhasil.
Kalau perundingannya sudah bulat

tidak akan ada perselisihan

antara Yogya dan Surakarta

dan kehendak Tuan kan terlaksana;
Kalau Pangeran Dipanagara

(masih) memaksa mempertahankan diri dan tidak memperbolehkan

perkebunan Tegalreja
dilintasi jalan,

makin besar dosanya.
Demikianiah pendapat saya.

Seperti menentang kepada kedua negara
(dan) Pangeran Dipanagara

pasti dapat dipertahankan dengan ringan.
Tapi terserah

kehendak Paduka Tuan."

Smissaert mengangguk-angguk

dan bergembira sekali.

26. Tuan Residen berkata dengan tenang:
"Jurubahasa Dietrée bagaimana
pendapatmu tentang nasihat ini?
Dapatkah kamu ada persesuaian

Tuan Godlieb Dietrée menyahut:
"Saya mengikuti saja

soal jalan yang akan menjadi rebutan

(dan) tidak bergembiralah (kita) jika menang.

(Banyak) perajurit akan mati

(untuk sesuatu) yang tidak ada harganya sekecilpun.

Kalau boleh, panggillah Sang Pangeran

(calon) jalan yang paling baik

di Tegalreja.

Walaupun berbelok sedikit,

jika sekiranya cukup untuk membuat perondaan
mengelilingi kora,

(dapadlah) Tuan mengampuni

kesalahan Pangeran:

Tapi seumpamanya

(Paduka, Tuan tidak senang (dengan rencana ini )
silakan saya hanya menyerahkan saja."

Setiausaha Chevallier,
Wiranagara dan

Dietrée membenarkan
pertimbangan Raden Adipati;
tidak ada yang

menyalahkan sedikitpun.

bahwa Pangeran Mangkubumi

memaksamu datang.

Tentu (akan ada) pertempuran perang (dan)

negara Yogys.

Apakah puteranda dapat mempertahankan diri?
(Sebab) saya melihat bahwa putranda masib lemah

Sungguh berat dan sulit orang berperang,

Harus ada pakaian yang lengkap:
pertama askarnya

harus dilengkapi pakaian dan makanan

Contoh dan teladan tidak kurang

di Tanah Jawa, puteraku; sudah banyak

yang membuat serupa

dan menentang ratunya.

Di zaman dulu (Adipati) Pragola di Pati

(sudah) melawan datuknya

Paduka Sultan Agung.

Rakyat Pati dibinasakan (dalam peperangan).

Tidak ada satupun yang (masih) hidup, dari pembesar (dan) rakyat kecil;
(dan) Pati dihancurkan.

Nenekmu sendiri,

Paduka Sultan Yogya yang pertama pernah membuat (demikian),
waktu beliau mau melawan Belanda

(dan) memusuhi Edeleer Van Imhoff;

seluruh Nusa Jawa tercengang

(dan) Belanda tertumpas.

Pada akhirnya

nenekmu mengadakan perdamaian

dengan Belanda (dan) mendapat separoh negara;

Oleh karena itu, puteraku,

apapun yang terjadi, Gusti,

jangan sampai-bermusuhan

dengan Belanda. Sungguh berat itu,

dan apalagi nenek moyangmu

yang dulu naik takhta menjadi Raja

sudah berjanji (dan) bersumpah

bahwa tidak akan memperbolebkan

memakai perbuatan khianat

kepada Belanda." Demikianiah sabda Sang Pangeran seraya
meneteskan air mata.

Pangeran Dipanagara bersabda dengan tenang:
"Jika Paduka takut melawan

Belanda, dari sekarangpun juga

sekaligus menjadi musuh saya."

Pangeran Mangkubumi berdiam diri

Diz menyerah kepada (takdir) Tuhan.
Sementara itu ada yang datang memberi tahu

disertai dua orang Belanda."
Sang Pangeran berkata dengan manis:
'Suruhlah mereka masuk (ke sini) sekarang juga."
(Yang disuruh) menyetujui, menyembah (dan) berangkat.

Tumenggung Sindunagara
dan orang Belanda duduk di atas kursi-

(Sindunagara) bersabda perlahan (dengan penuh hormat)

20. kedua tangannya dipersatukan:
"Saya diutus Paduka Tuan

biarpun jalan-jalan sampai berlumpur

bagaimanapun juga saya tetap

Apabila Residen mau

membawa bala tentara lengkap dengan alat-alat perang
untuk menyiksa diri saya,

biarpun dia memerintahkan (atau) tidak melarang,
mati dan hidup pasti tidak akan terjadi

(sebab) Gusti Allah yang punya.

Kalau Smissaert mengaku

dapat membuat mati dan hidup

(dan) bukan Allah Taala,

maka dalam pandangan saya

Belanda berwarak buruk,

tidak parut memegang hukum dan keadilan:
Lekas menyampaikan (kata-kara saya ini)

kepada si botak-ngeletak. Sejak kecil
(saya) selalu ditakuti kalau diberi perintah,
(tapi) cantangan-tantangan mau

berangkat ke medan perang adalah percakapan yang kosong,

sekarang saya tidak takut (lagi).
(Heh) Sindunagara, dengan cepat,
berkata kepadanya bahwa

saya akan menunggu dia di sini seja.

Jika jadi berangkat ke medan perang; si botak akan kecewa hati

kalau saya didak ada."

Dua orang Belanda sama melongo,

keduanya tidak dapat bersuara.

Lantas Sindunagara dengan segera

minta diri untuk pulang.

Dengan lekas-lekas mereka pergi,

tige orang termasuk Belanda.

Mereka naik kuda saperti terbang

dipacu kuda dengan cepat. Segera mereka tiba

di pejabat. Para pegawai tinggi masih lengkap berhadir.

mukanya merah, penuh kebengisan

"Saya di sini masih bingung seperti anak kerbau.
(Pendapat) saya tidak berbeda dengan kamu.

Kalau begitu nasibatku (begini):

Mari (biar kita) meminta keterangan dari atasan,
dari Raden Mayor Wiranagara.

Orang berperang adalah hal mudah

asal sudah mengetahui duduk perkaranya.

Para Lurah, Litnan, Kapten dan (perwira) atasan,
ikutilah saya dari belakang

dan harap berhati-hati!

Yang sudah terjadi

tebih dahulu adalah bahwa Raden Mayor Wiranagara
tidak mempertimbarigkan anjuran yang bail;

dia suka menguasai (orang) (dan) mengemukakan dir.
Bila nanti dia tidak memperdulikan anjuran kami
marilah kita menyerang bersama!"

Para perwira menjawab serentak.

memerintahkan kepada Kopral masing-masing

Fo

35.

Babad Dipanagara

bahwa sebabnya para perwira

sudah kembali semua untuk menghadap kepada Paduka
adalah bahwa mereka punya pertanyaan:

iaizh apa sebenarnya yang menjadi

kesslahan Pangeran Dipanagara

sampai dia diserang perajurit?

Kalau diperbolehkan

saya mohon petunjuk

dari Paduka kepada para perwira

apakah kesalahan Pangeran

Dipanagara yang sesungguhnya,

agar supaya kita tidak ragu-ragu dalam hati kecilaya
(dan) walaupun kelak menemui ajalnya

tidak akan ads satupun yang melarikan diri>

Tetapi jika belum diberi tahu

para perwira sekalian

rela menyerabkan mati dan hidupnya (kepadamu)
bahkan akan rela diturunkan kedudukannya."
Raden Mayor Wiranagara,

waktu mendengarkan ucapan

dari Surabraja, (menjadi) sangat marah.

Sang Raden Tunenggung memaki dan menunjuk (dengan relunjuk jari)
(dengan berkata): "Eh Surabraje kalau

kamu takut mati,

jangan setengah-setengah saja! Sckaligus menjadi-musub

(dan) berbaliklah kepada pihak Tegalreja

saat sekarang ini juga!

(Kelihatan) bahwa kamu sedang menggomel mencari kesalahan.

menarik pestoinya

(dan) semua membidik bersama.

Sang Raden Mayor berwaspada (dan) melarikan diri
dengan memacu kudanya.

Dia diikuti dari belakang,

(dan) diberondong dengan pistol terapi satupun tidak kena.
Surabraja berteriak memanggilnya dengan berkara:
"Mengapa kamu sedang lari begitu cepat

Mayor? Apakah kamu tidak punya rasa malu

kalau mengucap se-enaknya saja seperti pelawak?
Seolah-olah kamu (harus) dihormati

sebab mengandalkan keturunan Surapati,

keturunannya musuh Belanda.

Kamu ingin memperlibat-likatkan jasamu dengan percaya penuh kepada Kompeni.

Kembalilah si drohun (bodoh)!"
Mayor Wiranagara

menggelitik kuping kuda

(dan) menggerutu:

"Melayani orang gila saja!"

Surabraja lantas

menghentikan pemburuan Mayor, lalu
berunding dengan kawan-kawannya

para perwira semua:

HISTORICAL NOTES AND COMMENTARY

1 Rispati Wage haping sangalasisas? Btsar ing taun Be: For a full discussion of the
date and chronology of the babad, see part I1 of the Introduction above.

2 Panjéninganiva Ka(ngyéng Sultani......]Panfntngan gangsal warseki; Sukan
Haméngkubuwana V was born on 25 Jan. 1820 and was raised as Sultan on 19
Dec. 1822 when he was nor quite three years old. He ruled with the help of
guardians until 26 Nov. 1836 and his nickname was Sultan 'Timur' (the 'young"
Sultan) see SB 136 (Babed Ngayogua, vol. II) XIV. 5-6, p. 61; XXX1.39, p.

126; Kota Jogjakarta dua ratus tahun, p; 153; MK 2452, BGG br, 4 Feb. 1820,
nos. 15-16.

3 sinung imban Sang Narpalsakawan pikukub: on the establishment of the guar-
dians by De Salis see Louw, vol. 1, pp. 449-52. Contrary to the impression
given in this babad, the four guardians were Dipanagara, Mangkubumi, Ratu
Agéng and Ratu Kencana (on the latter see below n. 120). The seal of state was
entrusted to theyResident (Smissaert) and the administration of the Sultan's
lands was in the hands of the Patih, but these latter were not guardians.

4 sisilib Kadipatyan; this would seem to suggest that Mangkubumi, the senior
Yogya Pangeran, was placed in charge of the kadipater (the Crown Prince's
establishment) until such time as a new Crown Prince was appointed. But there
is no confirmation of this in other Dutch and Javanese sources.

5 apan angreh sajroning puri/.....] mring Pangran Dipanagara: all four guardians
had control of the kraton finances and the administration of the court did not
solely devolve on Dipanagara, although the latter remained a figure of impor-
tance and influence in kraton circles, see J.F. Walraven van Nes, 'Verhandeling
over de waarschijnlijke corzaken, die aanleiding tor de onlusten van 1825 en
de volgende jaren'iin 'de vorstenlanden-gegeven hebben', TNI, vol. 6 (1844),
pp. 145-52 (henceforth Van Nes, 'Verhandeling').

6 Neyakanira Sang Rajeng: the Sultan's Nayakas (principal advisers) were the
eight Wiedenas (the four Inner and four Outer Bupatis of the court), who gave
particular help to the Patih in the business of administration, see GR, vol. I, p.
238. In this babad, the term is used very loosely to describe an 'authority' not a

head of a department of the kraton administration as is usual (note of Dr.
Th.G.Th. Pigeaud).

7 marang Kangjéing Raden DipatiiDanur¥ja ..... this refers to Raden Adipati
Danur&ja IV, Path of Yogyakarta, 2 Dec. 1813-13 Feb. 1847. For a discus-
sion of his character and antecedents see below n. 97.

8 kukumah kat myang kisas: both hadd and gisas are parts of Islamic penal law, see
Juynboll, HMW, pp. 295-311. In the Javanese kratons before 1847, this law was
administered by the court of the Swrambi, see below n. 12 and L.W.C. van den Berg,
'De Mohammedaansche Geestelijkheid', p. 33.

9 gilap song-songipun|saengga kadya Narendra: one of the changes brought about
by Daendels' famous decree on 'Ceremonial and Etiquette' (28 Jul. 1808) was

she right of the Residents to carry a gold state umbrella (Payung) with a blue
stripe, emblazoned with the arms of Lodewijk I (Louis Bonaparte) of Holland
1806-1810) which, according to De Graaf, GI, p. 369, was designed by
Dsendels himself. The choice of gold, a colour usually only reserved for roy-
aly in Java, naturally seemed to the Javanese to plac Residents on the
same footing as the independent rulers. Daendels decision remained in
force, with minor variations, throughout the nineteenth century and was only
nally abolished by the hormat and payung circulars of Governor-General J.B.
wan Heutsz (1904-09) in 1904 (see E. Breton de Nijs (pseud. Rob
Nieuwenhuys), Tempo  PFotographische  documenten - uit het oude
Indie (Amsterdam, 1973), p. 114. On Jr. Anthonié Hendrik Smissaert (1777-
1832) who was Res. of Yogyakarta from 11 Feb. 1823 until his dismissal on 26
Sept. 1825, see D.M. Campbell, Jene Past and Present, vol. 1 (London, 1915),

pp. 438-40 and De Haan, 'Personalia', pp. 648-9 (see also below ns. 87 &
152)

Pangeran kakalib datan/sinaruwe .....; the fact that Mangkubumi and Dipanagara
were rarely consulted on affairs relating to the guardianship was noticed both
by Dutch officials and by contemporaries in the kraton (see dK no. 111, De
Kock, Over het karakter van den Soesochoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta
en de prinsen en rijksgrooten', 10 Dec. 1829; dK no. 165, 'Translaar-verhaal
van Prins Adiwinotto', n.d.; Van det Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 575-6). Later,
Mangkubumi and Dipanagara complained to De Kock about the failure of the
Resident, the Secretary (Chevallier) and the Patih,.to consult with them: LOr
2168, no. 11, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, n.d. (@ 29 Sept.
1823):

..... punapa malih kula sami minongka angembani dhumaténg i(ng) Jéengan-

dika Sultan Timur, sakathahing paparentah botén mawi atépang kaliyan

kula ...
Dipanagara himself was also partly to blame for the breakdown in communica-
tions for he seems to have withdrawn almost completely from affairs in
Yogyakarta after about April 1824, see Van Nes, 'Verhandeling', pp. 152-3.

kang wong cilik bingung: the description which is given here of the general
decline and corruption in Yogyakarta before the Java War, is common to many
babad descriptions of periods of dissoluteness: But it is particularly important
in this context as it has a direct connectionwith popular expectations of the
coming of the Ratu Adil. In the Javanese view the period. immediately preced-
ing the rule of the 'Just King! would be one of rapid social and political decay,
see Wiselius, 'Djdjd B&jd, p. 186; Drewes, Drie Jarzansche Goeree's, pp. 160-4;
Louw, vol. I, Bijlage XVII, p. 730 and above pt. V.F. of the Introduction.

tan lumampah chukuming Surambil nora aft adiling Pradata; the law courts in
Yogyakarta during this period were divided between the Pradata (civil court),
the Swrambi (Islamic court), the Resident's court, and the Jabsa nZgara (magis-
trate's court).

(i) The Pradate was presided over by the chief magistrate of Yogyakarta
{jaksa ageng), Kyai Tum&nggung Nitipraja, the jakse (magistrate) of the Patih,
the jaksa of the Crown Prince, and the jaksas of the 8 Wedanas. It met on set
days in the pindbapa Pradatan, and if cases involved Chinese or Europeans, the
Resident or the Assistant-Resident was always present. Sentences passed were
based on the Javanese lawbooks, Anggér Predata-Daltm, Ange¥r-Aging and Angg-
¢r Sépuluh, and the right of revision of sentence was reserved to the Patih in cases

involving Javanese.

(ii) The Surambi was the religious court presided over by the chief Penguly
of Yogyakarta, the Kétib Anom and four mosque Kétibs (on the title Kétib, see

235

13

14

Historical Notes & Commentary

below n. 102). The religious scholars in figh law (ie. the from the
pathok nigara) were also usually consulted on all matters of religion, death,
marriage and inheritance. Cases were tried in the main square in front of the

mosque or within the mosque (Mésjid Ageng) itself. Any death sentences were
revised by the Resident's court.

(iii) The Resident's court was presided over by the Resident, Assistant-
Resident, the Patih and the Péngaln, with the chief jaksz acting as the public
prosecutor. The court itself had been set up by Raffies' regulation of $1 Feb.
1814 (see Raffles, HJ, vol. II, Appendix D) for cases involving all Javanese not
born in the princely territories, and for Europeans, Chinese and other foreig-
ners. 'Government law' (a blend of Roman law and Dutch civil law) was used.
The revision of sentences was referred to the High Court (Raad van Justitie) in
Semarang, where, after 1817, all cases involving tollgate disputes between
Javanese and Chinese were tried (see MyK 2439, BGG br, 14 Sept. 1817, no.
9 and above pt. IX of the Introduction).

(iv) The Jobsa nigara, was the magistrate's court, presided over by the
Patih's assistant, was held at the pasebe before the kraton or before the
Kipatiban. It usually reviewed cases before passing them on to the jurisdiction
of the other courts (see MyK 3055, 'Beschrijving en statistieke rapport betref-
fende de Residentie Djocjocarta' (1836); further descriptions of the legal system
at the Central Javanese courts can be found in Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', pp.
633-52; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving', p. 69, pp. 112-17; Van den Berg,
'De Mohammedaansche Geestelijkheid', p. 33 and vAB (aanwinsten, 1941) no.

nd.)

For contemporary descriptions of Danuréija's interference with the working of
the Pradata before the Java Wat, and for Danut&ja's dismissal of two of
Dipanagara's associates, see Louw, vol. I, p. 23, pp. 85-7, pp. 522-23; Van
der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 328.

tunggak jarak marajakl......sntlan wadya rucab: both of these Javanese proverbs
illustrate the social changes which occurred in Yogyakarta before the outbreak
of the Java War, and have a connection with the period of decline which was
thought to precede the rule of the Ratu. Adi? (see above n. 11). The ricinus
(castor-oil plant) is a bush. which grows anywhere in Java and is very common-
place, whereas the teak tree (jaf?) takes years to come to maturity and is very
valuable. Thus, by implication common people were appointed to undeserved
positions, whereas 'the, older incumbents, 'who had taken years to gain the
maturity and wisdom which the positions demanded, were dismissed. For a
description of the social changes preceding the Java War in Yogyakarta see the
Introduction pt. IX above and Louw, vol. 1, pp. 85-87 quoting Jayadiningrat.

karya pasanggrahan Tegalrifa; the pasanggrahan mentioned here almost cer-
tainly refers to Dipanagara's retreat (PanZpen) at which he built after
the death of his great-grandmother in 1803, slightly to the north-east of the
main building at Tégalréja (see Louw. vol. I, Map 3). In his babad, Dipanagara
described the site, which had a small building and a stone (selz gr/ang) for per-
forming tapa (asceticism and meditation) sheltered by a kémuning tree (see
below n. 16) and ringed around completely by a moat. The place where
Dipanagara sat was therefore an island, and in another place it is referred to as
the 'Pulo Waringin', the island of waringins, for it was planted with those trees.
In front of the small building there was a large curved pond full of different
kinds of fishes (LOr 6547 b (Babad Dipanagara), XK A0-41, p. 324; XX.52,
p. 328). Dipanagara's description is confirmed in Brumund's report on the site
('Bezock', pp. 192-4) written in the 1840's;

Babad Dipanagara

'From Tégalr&ja, we went to It lies on the east side of Tégalréja and
very close by..... was the principal place of penance and prayer for
Dipanagara. It is a fair space and area of uneven ground which lies within the
wooded area of the desz (village). Of the wall which earlier encircled it, only
parts remain. There is not much to see. The spout which conveyed his water
has long since dried up. Only dry trenches are left. At the side there still stand
the walls of a small house, which consisted of just one room with a large couch
built of brick. There the penitent ate and drank ... in front of the house lies a
dry stone pond. Here and there fruit trees grow. The scent of the pungent
éimuning tree fills the air. It is the tree of holy places and graves .... six large
yonis (female Sivaitic symbols) especially catch the eye. They are placed in two
rows next to each other, the three rear ones slightly higher than the three in
front. They formed the broad prayer place of Dipanagara. In front of it bends a
small, deep stone pond ... the bottom of the yonis had been placed uppermost
..' (see further Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p. 26 n. 86, p. 37; and on the struc-
ture of Javanese gardens, see Denys Lombard, 'Jardins a Java', Arts Astatiqnes,
vol. 20 (1969), pp. 135-83).

prinah lring kadhatun: 'Tégalt¥ja does not lie due north of the kraton but
about three kilometres to the N.W. and was connected to Yogya at that time

by a small road across the rice-felds (see Louw, yol. I, Map. 3). It was built by
Dipanagara's great-grandmother (the Ratu Tégalréja) in the 1790's.

medicine against worms and mixed with the resin of wiyrax benzoin they are
burnt as incense to chase away mosquitoes (see F.S.A. de Clercq. Niezw
Plantkundig Woordenboek voor Nederlandsch Indie (1st ed. Amsterdam, 1909) p.
266 no. 1983). Brumund, 'Bezoek, p. 188, noticed a large Amuning tree
which would have spread a canopy of white flowers over Dipanagara's head as
he sat meditating (see also J. Vis Janssen van Ray, 'Wat de Oude boom in
den dalem van den Javaanschen Hamlet belecfde', Indische Verlofganger
(1926-7), p. 51). The withered trunk of this tree can be seen today (1972).

and Guwa Sécang (at SElarong, see below n. 24). Guwa Upas (in the Kulon
Praga area on the road to Samigaluh) is also described in the Kédbung
Kibo, KITLV Or, 13, III 9-17, pp. 26a-30b as having been visited by
Dipanagara, see further Louw, vol. II, p. 332.

sum¥eng ardi: in Java important graves and shrines are sometimes sited on
hills. The most famous site is that of Imagiri where the members of the royal
families of Yogyakarta and Surakarta are buried. Dipanagara also mentioned
the hill of Rasamuni (nr. Plered on the western abutments of Gunung Kidul)
where his meeting with the Rav Adil took place. In the Buku Kédhang Kto
Dipanagara's abdi-dalem (retainers) are also depicted as having visited various
mountain sites in Banyumas, Bagélen and K&dhu to search for signs before the
Java War (KITLV Or. 13 VI. 26-VIIL12 pp. 68-84, and see Ricklefs, op. c/.

Historical Notes & Commentary

20 ing Silarong wastanya: Sélarong (or Silarong) is a locality in the hilly limestone
area lying to the west and east of Kali Bédhog about two kilometres to the
west of Bantul. The neighbourhood comprises (ricefields) and palm
groves near the river (Bedhog) and then a low limestone ridge and hills (see
Louw, vol. I, pp. 435-7 and Map 8, 'Situatie-Schets van Selarong en Oms-
teken'). The (village area) is today known as K&mbang Putian and is
mentioned by that name in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 25, p.
390). There is some doubt about the ownership of the fenab /ungewb (apanage
land) in the area at that time. According to Paku Alam 1, it belonged half to a
Surakarta Bupati, RT. Rajaniti, and half to Dipanagara's younger brother P.
Adinégara, who received the land from RT. Sumadiningrat (died 1812)
because he had been brought up by him as a child (AvJ, p. Paku

to Danuta, Jul. 1825). But in the Babad (BL Add. 12330,
XNV.1-29, £. 81v-84r) Dipanagara is described as having received grants of
land in the Gésikan area (? near Bantul) after the fall of the kraton in June
1812. These grants of land to the south of Yogyakarta were also mentioned by
Dipanagara to Major de Stuers after his capture at Magélang in 1830 (see De
Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI, p. 743). So it is likely that he owned some of
the land in the Sélarong area. Smissaert later described Dipanagara's improve-
ments to his lands in building irrigation systems and planting coconut and fruit
trees (see below n. 24). He also stated that Dipanagara owned two estates on
the west bank of the Praga-tiver named Sukama and Gegulu which served as
centres for troop concentrations at the beginning of the Java War (vAE no. 28,
Smissaert to King William 1, n.d. (? Sept. 1828); dK no. 181, Smissaert to De

Kock, 13 Aug. 1825; Louw, vol. I, p. 432 and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p.
405).

21 sakidule ing Ambarkatawang: Ambatkatawang or Gunung Gamping (the lime-
stone hill) lies about 3 kilometres due west of Yozyakarta and once served as
the temporary kraton of P. Mangkubumi (HB) before 1755. In 1825 it was
still a royal péanggraban (see NBS 133, pt. VIH Pemut yasa-daltm kalange-
nan'). The place was important for the production of limestone which was used
as bricks and mortar in buildings in Yogyakarta (see the references in Dj. Br.
22, Wiese to Daendels, 22 Oct. 1809; Van Sevenhoven, 'Aanteekeningen', p
107; KITLV H 698 b, AvJ, Nahuys van Burgst to Van der Capellen, 3 Feb.
1820, who stated that 600. préw/ of limestone was sold every month in
Yogyakarta). Before the Java War, Dipanagara, in his function as a guardian,
apparently controlled the Chinese workers in the limestone ovens at Gamping
but took them away' from him'(see Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 13). One of
the reasons for Smissaert's decision to widen the road around Tégalr¥ja was to
facilitate the transport of lime to Yogyakarta (see below n. 42).

22 pacingkraman kadya nigari: (GR, vol. 1, p. 309) has the sense of a
place to wander and relax especially in the company of women. The construc-
tion of royal pavilions in such places outside Yogyakarta was
especially popular during the reign of the second Sultan and before the Java
War (see Van Nes, 'Verhandeling\, p. 123).

23 ... lun-alun: an alun-alun is a large square or open space before the residence of a
Bupati or before a kraton (see GR, vol. I, p. 113).

24 denreka pataman: Dipanagata's improvements to his estates were described by
Smissaert (see above n. 20). In his babad, Dipanagara mentioned the garden
outside the cave of Sécang which was called 'Modang! (see LOr 6547 b, XX.
48, p. 326 and GR, vol. II, p. 495 which describes modang as a white or evenly
coloured rectangle or square in the middle of a headshawl or jacket). The cave
and the area surrounding it were apparently improved by Dipanagara's retainers
(Interview with the Lurah of Kémbang Putian, 12 Dec. 1971 and Louw, vol. I,

op. 435-7). The latter made a sketch of the cave showing its dimensions and
e view it commanded over the surrounding countryside (see Louw, vol. 1,

Map 7).

mmanéman duren lawan hatele ing pinggir genya: the
sescriptions of the plants and trees mentioned here are given in De Clercq's
book as follows: durian (duren), D. zibethinus Murr. (De Clercq, p. 225, no.
1180) is of three sorts: duren s2k¥tan, which bears fruits with white flesh and
small pips, duren siférubuk, which bears fruit with yellow flesh and large pips,
and duren bunghik which has very small fruit. The wood of the durian is much
ased in Java for furniture and planks. The pips of the durian fruit are cooked
after the skin has been taken off and eaten with rice. Manggis, G. Mangostana
L. (De Clercq, p. 245, no. 1592) is a tree (mangostan tree) which has a pleas-
ant purple skinned fruit. The wood is used for building houses and the skin of
the fruit serves as a purple die. A decoction of the dried skin of the fruit can
be used as a potion against stomach ailments. Dbuwit, E. Jambolana Lam. (De
Clercq, p. 232, no. 1329) has a sweet fruit which is eaten and the extract of
which can be used for palm wine. The bark can be employed for tanning
Ssh-nets and sails. Dbwéz, see above n. 16. Pijetan and kokosan (De Clercq, p.
266, no. 1983) are of the same family as the dbuku. The kokosan fruit is the
sweetest and the piféten is somewhere in taste between the two with a very
thin skin and large pips. Jamb, Engenia sp: div. (fam. of Myrtaceae) (De Clercq,
p. 231, no. 1314) has a fruit which is eaten everywhere. In old Javanese
legends there is talk of women as begutiful as the yamby tree. Kepundbung, B.
racemosa Muell. Arg. (De Clercq, p. 187, no. 395) is a small tree with sweetish
sour round fruits which are eaten. The wood is very sturdy and reliable. Mun-
«bu, G. dulcis, Kurz, (De Clercq, p. 244, no. 1589) is a tree whose wood is not
long lasting. The fruit can be eaten and the sap used for Javanese medicine
jamu). Wickerwork is sometimes cooked with its bark to give a green colour.
Carime, P. distichus Muell. Arg. (De Clercq, p. 303, no. 2683) a tree (Cheramel
tree) whose small bitter fruits are used in the preparation of crystallized fruits
and jams. By making an incision into the root, a sap can: be extracted which
has a very poisonous content. Sémzal, Sandoricum Andicum Cav. (fam. of
Meliaceae) (De Clercq, p. 321, no. 3027) is a tall tree which grows everywhere
in Java. The wood serves as carpentry wood for planks and coarse furniture and
the fruit is eaten. The foots are used for Javanese medicine (jamw). Jambe,
Areca Catechn L. (De Clercq, p. 171, no. 313) an areca or Pinang palm tree.
The seeds are used as srib for chewing after they have been dried and the
skins taken off. They are intoxicating if smoked. When the fruit is still young,
it can be used as a medicine against dysentry and it is also given to cattle to
harden them against the cold. The wood is used for- making small objects and
the leaves are used as sheathes to wrap things. The foliage is also employed for
colouring wicker and plaited work, Kumangi &émang/), 0. sanctum L. (De
Clercq, p. 291, no. 2477) is a tree, the leaf of which is used in herbal prepara-
tions. It is chopped up and placed as a compress on the heads of children suf-
fering from colds. It is also used in the treatment of pregnancy and for wounds.
Sulasih (Tulasib), Ocimum Basilicam L. (fam. of Labiatae) (De Clercq, p. 291,
no. 2474). A herbal plant, the usual basil (Gasilicam), which is used as an
aromatic herb for food and medicines. The pips are mixed for drinks and the
preparation of jamu. Ganda-ruse, J. Gendarussa Burm. (De Clercq, p. 263, no.
1948), a shrub which is used for fencing. The leaves are prepared as a com-
press for bruises and internal sickness. Kimpal, Colocasia antiquorum Schott. (De
Clercq, p. 207, no. 847) usually referred to in Javanese as ta/és, or bentul.
These plants have large tubers which can be eaten, those of the éimpul are red,
the others white. The leaves are sometimes pounded to make a dessert. Gém-

27 aneng kone pra garwa-putra umiringlabdi myang kulawongsa: see above n. 20 for
the improvements made by Dipanagara on his estates. The picture which the
babad gives here was confirmed by Dipanagara in a conversation with Major de
Stuers (De Klerck, vol. V. Bijlage XXXVI, p. 744, in which he said ... 'I often
went to Pasar Gédhe (Kutha Gedhe), Imagiri, to the south coast and to
Sélarong ... to the (latter) two places I always took a large escort with me ... to
help cut and plant padi (rice) which popularised the chiefs with the people ...).
Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 247, wrote as follows about the habit of the Javanese offi-
cials and nobility and officials to engage in manual work in the ricefields:

"Those of the highest rank and greatest authority, generally attend at the
opening of new séwab fields, performing part of the work with their
own hands, and leading their inferiors and dependants, as they express it, to
pay respects to the earth in whose honour they also observe annually the
sedéka bumi (sedhekah bumi),.ot feast. to-the earth ...'.

See further Winter 'Beknopre Beschrijving', p. 42 on similar practices in Sala, and

see the Introduction: (pt. IX above) for a discussion of Dipanagara's 'common
touch'.

28 kathab para Tuminggung/myang Keliwon Pancieu Mantri: these are titles which
refer to officials of the Sultan's administration or to members of his family.
Tuminggung is a very old title already in use in the Majapahit period, and by
the nineteenth century often employed to indicate a Bupati (see GR, vol. 1, p.
710). Panews (lit. 'the leader of a thousand men') is-also used to refer to a
Bupati. Kliwon was the deputy of the Bupati and was used especially to denote
the assistants of the 8 Wadanas in the kraton (see above n. 6 and GR. vol. I., p.
495). Mantri is a slightly lower administrative official, usually a subordinate of
the Kliwon (see GR. vol. II, pp. 471-2). The titles Pangerar and Aria refer to
members of the Sultan's family: the former is usually given to the sons and
brothers of the Sultan, but it is not an automatic title and is given by the Sukan
according to the status of the mother. Aria (Riz from Skr. 'arya') is the title of
younger brother and is also used for Pangerans and their sons. According to a
report written in the early 19th century, the title Aria referred to distant rela-
tions of the sovereign see IOL Mack. Pr. 82, p. 295. The title Raden Mas Aria
was sometimes given to the grear-grandsons of the Sultan when they were not
eligible for the title of Pangeren (see!GR. vol. I; p. 61). One contemporary
Dutch source (KITLV H 76, pt. 2) lists 11 Pangerans, 17 Tuminggungs, 64
lower administrative officials and 78 Démangs from the Sultan's lands as having
followed Dipanagara at the beginning of the Java War. According to Jayadinin-
grat ('Schetsen', p. 16) a meeting took place between Dipanagara and various
Yogyakarta officials (Pangerans, Tuménggungs, Mantris and Démangs from the
villages) on 29 Oct. 1824 (5 Mulud A.J. 17532) at Téegalr&ja to discuss the pos-
sibility of a rebellion, although some were against the plan. P. Adiwinata men-
tioned another meeting between Dipanagara and various Yogyakarta Pangerans
(Jayakusuma (later P. Ngabehi), Adinegara, Suryabrangta, Adisurya, (the latter
three were brothers of Dipanagara) in June 1825 after the question of the road
had come up. The Pangerans agreed to bring the desa inhabitants out to fight
and Suryabrangta undertook to kidnap the young Sultan from the kraton. But
the plan was discovered because an attempt to include Purwadipura in the plot
failed (dK 165, 'Translaat-verhaal van prins Adiwinotto van hetgeen den op-

stand van Diepo Negoro heeft veroorzaakt', Yogya, n.d. (21826), (henceforth:
'Translaat-verhaal Adiwinotto').

240

Babad Dipanagara

29 bis lunge saking nagari: the usual indication that a member of the Sultan's fam-
ily wished to become a rebel (Erman) was his departure from the kraton, for
the regular attendance of princes and high officials at the court was a means of
demonstrating the support and recognition enjoyed by the reigning monarch.
Dipanagara himself had already indicated his displeasure by retiring to his da/ém
at Tegalreja and appearing rarely in the kraton in the years preceding the Java
War (see above n. 10 and Ricklefs, 'Early Inspirational Experience', p. 231).
Here he is referring to his plans to leave the environs of Yogyakarta altogether
and to set up a rival kraton at Sélarong, see below n. 197. Thus, in his babad,
he refers to the place as a »agar/ (a royal capital), LOr 6547 b, XXII, p. 393.
The fear that DN would leave Yogya and establish himself at Sélarong was also
expressed by the Ratu Agéng in the Buéz (KITLV Or. 13, VI. 17, p. 67b):

... pan asring andhawuhake/badhe mdal Silarong kinarya pura.

The relevant passage in DN's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII (Asmaradana) p. 393)
is as follows:
36. Mapan wus dadya négari
Ngayogya ngalih punika
kang pekén kelangkung genge
36. So (Sélarong) had become a capital,
Yogyakarta had moved there.
Its market was very large.
Later a huge store of pad (rice) was found there, see Bat. Cour. no. 40, 5 Oct.
1825 and below n. 221.

30 denya arsa aprang sabilollab: this refers to the jibad (Mal. .& Jav. prang sabil),
'the wat in God's way' (7 sabil Allah) to bring the heathen to embrace Islam
and to subject them to its laws. It is regarded as a sacred Muslim duty to con-
quer the unbelievers, thus the world is divided into the dar 4/-Is/am (the territ-
ory to Islam) and the dar a/-harb (the theatre of war) see. Juynboll, HMW, pp.
341-7, and Encyclopaedia van Nederlandsch-Indi¢, vol. 3, pp: 502-3). The con-
cept was well known in Java and the desire of Dipanagara-/to raise up the high
state of the Islamic religion' (mangun /wburipun agami Islam) was referred to
often in both the Pangerans' letters and by contemporaries at the time (see
espc. LOr 2168 no. 11, p. 3, Mangkubumi & Dipanagara to De Kock, ? 29
Sept. 1825):

... ingkang dados karsane Ki Arya Dipandgira baten lintang namung tetepe
agamane Gusti kula Kangjéng Nabi Muhammad, s.@.w. ......

and see Carey, 'Javanese Histories', Appendix, pp. 285-8 and Louw, vol. I, p.
438). DNs commander on the north coast (Pasésiz), P. Serang, (see below n.
2053) took the title of Serapatining prang Sabilollah ingkang anilipakin agama
Islam (see dK 180, N.M. van Rheede van Oudshoorn (Asst. Res. Salatiga) to
H.J. Domis, 29 Sept. 1825 enclosing a letter of P. Serang). In the Javanese
view, the concept of driving out the unbelievers and establishing Islam as the
pure religion (agame kang sac?) under a ruler who would stand firm as the reg-
ulator of the religion (rate panéflg panatagama) was closely linked with popular
expectations of the coming of a Ratw Adi! (see below ns. 107-8; Drewes, Drie
Javaansche Goeroe's, p. 168 and Carey 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 29-37).

31 Sukitaris Sipalye kalawanisi Dhiktre jurubasane: Pierre Frederik Henri Cheval-
lier was appointed Assistant-Resident of Yogyakarta on 28 Aug. 1823 and took
up his appointment on 1 Nov. 1823. He served in that function until his death
from a liver complaint on 11 Nov. 1825 (AvJ, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 28
Aug. 1823; Dj. Br. 52, Smissaert to Algemene Secretaris, 1 Nov. 1823; Dj.
Br. 54, Van Sevenhoven to Van der Capellen, 12 Nov. 1825). He was born in
Harderwijk in the Netherlands on 16 April 1795 and his family appears to
have been of French Huguenot descent. He joined the army in a cavalry regi-
ment, served at Waterloo and was seconded to the N.O.LL. (Durch East Indies

Army) in 1820. Retiring from the army in 1822 he took up a post as Secretary
of the Bantén Residency from which he was transferred in 1823 to Yogys. His
career was greatly advanced by the favour his father enjoyed as the tutor of
Governor-General Van der Capellen's children (MyK 4132, Smissaert to Du
Bus, 10 Aug. 1826; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 378; Louw, vol. 1, p. 306

med p. 256 n. 3, which gives an account of his military career and see below n.
160).

Johannes Godlieb Dictrée was born in Ungaran in 1782 and went to
Yogya in 1794 where he began his career as an interpreter cwo years later. He
continued to serve as interpreter of the Yogyakarta Residency with intermis-
sions until Jan. 1825 and later died of wounds he received when storming
Dipanagara's fortified position (benterg) at Plered in April 1826 (MyK 3124,
'Register van het Europese personeele op Java en Madoera', (Djokjokarta), 1
Jan. 1819; Dj. Br. 53, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 19 Jan. 1825; Dj. Br.
54, Van Sevenhoven to Van der Capelien 6 Jun. 1826; Bat. Cour. no. 17, 26
Apr. 1826; Louw, vol. II, p. 261 n. 1). For a description of the background to
Dipanagara's personal antagonism to these two men see Van der Kemp, "Ham-

lettype', pp. 313-4; Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 41 and Van Nes, 'Verhandeling', p.
154.

wong lilima ...: the babad writer is here referring to the three Dutch officials:
Smissaert, Chevallier and Dietrée aswell as to and Major Wirana-
gara. Dipanagara later mentioned to Knoerle (Journal', p. 7) that Danuréja,
Chevallier and Smissaert had been as one (dedos sunggel bemawon) and that
these three rode out together, ate together, and that the common people
(tang ali?) could never get justice because the three were 'as one together'.

kadyedan tinabuban: in Java, madmen are sometimes taken around as a popu-
lar spectacle and a drum beaten to attract an audience. This is the sense
implied here (note by Dr. Th.G.Th. Pigeaud, Leiden, Jul. 1973).

sun aria ngupaya margiltinundbung mring Walonda: it is not clear that
Dipanagara inciced the Dutch to attack him at Tégalréja and it seems more
likely that their expedition took him by surprise. It is certain, however, that he
was planning & rebellion in advance. P.H. van Lawick van Pabst (MyK 4132,
'Consideratién op de Nota van den Heer MacGillavry', Aug. 1826 (henceforth
Van Pabst, 'Nota') mentioned that he was preparing to revolt at least three
months before the attack on Most reports state that he was planning
to start his campaign in the month of Swrz in the Javanese year Wawz (16 Aug.
- 15 Sept. 1825). Thus, a: Fajr reported ©6 Danurdja that Dipanagara had
plans to leave Yogyakarta and go to Majasta near T&mbayat on 8 Sure (Av,
Haji Ali to Danurja, 18 Jul. 1825). The Bwkt mentions that all his followers
were awaiting 7 Sura to start the rebellion (KITLV Or. 13 IX. 12-13, p. 89)
and a report by a cavalry captain of the Mangkun@garan Legion stated that
Dipanagara's followers at Sélarong were awaiting the month of Sure to begin
their attack on Yogyakarta (dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas
Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825). Smissaert himself wrote that the first full-scale
attack of Dipanagara's troops on Yogyakarta took place on 8 Sere (22 Aug.
1825) when the prince's followers advanced on the town dressed in white with
turbans of vatious colours (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Resident of Kedhu (P.
le Clereg), 23 Aug. 1825 and see Payen, 'Voyage', 18 Aug. 1825 who related
the rumour that Dipanagara had had a dream in which Sultan Agung had told
him that 8 Sure was the right time to attack Yogya). For a discussion of the

significance of the month of Sura as a time for the Ret# Adil to proclaim him-
self, see below n. 108.

Sastraprayitna wastane/lan Sastradimija wus: only Mas Ngabehi Sastradiméja is
mentioned (as Astradiméja) in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXI 474).

Babad Dipanagara

91-92) where he is described as the Patih of P. Mangkubumi who carried a
lesser to Dipanagara from Smissaert on 19 July 1825 (see below n. 140). He is
also referred to in the Jayabaya version of the Babad Dipanagara, (NBS 37, II.
3, p. 9). He later became an army commander of Dipanagara in Bagélen with
the name of Tuménggung Reksapraja (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 43, pp. 394-5, and

see below n. 216). In Jayadiningrat 'Schetsen', p. 56 he is referred to as Kyai
Nesbchi Resupraja.

W muwerimuka wong durjana jro nagari: this refers to the very large class of ban-
dits, robbers and idlers who made their living by thieving and highway robbery.
They are referred to later in the babad (II. 10) as wong (the scum of
the earth). A good example of a worg durjana is the bandit chief from Parakan
in KEdhu who is described below (see n. 74). Often the worg durjana were
erstwhile members of the g/ladbag, the porters' guilds at the kratons or bujangs
(landless labourers) (see Louw, 1, p. 26). The latter originated from the villages
but during their time as porters on the roads (usually six months) picked up
habits of gambling and opium smoking which usually led to crime (see J.1. van
Sevenhoven's excellent description in KITLV H 503, 'Aanteckeningen
zchouden op eene reis over Java van Batavia naar de Oosthoek in ....... 1812,
pp. 49-52 (henceforth Van Sevenhoven;. 'Aanteekeningen').  Crawfurd
calculated that there were 'about 30,000.such men in the Kédhu area in 1812
carrying loads as far afield as Sémarang and the courts and wrote that '... they
have no fixed habitation, and 'by the wandering and unsettled life they pursue,
they have contracted the most inveterate habits of idleness, dissipation and
profligacy .... (IOL Mack. Pr. vol. 21, John Crawfurd, 'Report upon the Dis-
trict of Cadoe', 13 Nov. 1812, p. 284 and see Afdeling Statistiek, De Residen-
ti Kadoe (Batavia, 1871), p. 53, p. 58 on the strength of KEdhu porters when
compared to those from other areas). The most important centre of wong dur-
jana in the Yogyakarta area was Blunyah, slightly to the north of the town,
which later became the headquarters, of the Yogyakarta underworld described
so fascinatingly by J. Groneman in his Ber geschiedenis Vorstenlandsche to-
itanden 11, Djogia 20 Feb. 1884 (Dordrecht 1887). It was common practice for
Javanese nobles to have such men in their pay: thus in Yogya before the Java
War, P. Ngabehi, P. Pamot, P. Démang and P. Abubakar had particularly bad
reputations as paymasters. of professional robbers (dK 145, Waterloo,
'Memorie' (1808); Dj Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 7 Aug. 1825). Accord-

a ing to Van der Kemp (Economische Oorzaken' p. '14'n, 1) most of the robbers
| (Recus) in the princely territories originated from the Yogya area. Contempor-
ary reports and other babad accounts confirm this babad's description of
Dipanagara's connections with wong derjane in Yogyakarta. Thus, on 15 July,
he was reported to have summoned the wong dur/en« from Kamijara and Man-
gir, desas to the south of Yogya on the Kali Praga near the junction with the
Kali Bédhog (MyvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert' no. 10, Mas Ngabehi Wiraprana to
Danuréja, 15 Jul. 1825) and there is a piagém (letter of appointment) from
Dipanagara to Kyai Ngabehi Angawicana appointing him as head of all the
bandits and ecus (robbers) in the Yogya area (dK no. 182, MacGillayry to De
Kock, 28 Jul. 1825, enclosing a translation of Dipanagara's piagtm dated the
month of B&sar, Be, AJ. 1752 (Jul. 1825). In the Yogya babad (SB 136 (Baked
Ngayogya, vol. ID; L. 41-2, p. 217) there is also a passage which relates how
Démang Jayam@&nggala from the desa of Samen in the Pandhak district to the
south of Yogya was raised as a Tumerggung by Dipanagara with the name of
Jayan@gara and was given charge of all the wong durjana to the south of the
capital (see further Bat. Cour. no. 106, 3 Nov. 1827, report of Col. F.D.
Cochius, 20 Oct. 1827). The same man was also an expert in the manufacture
of gunpowder (see below n. 166). Smissaert himself remarked on the numbers

of criminals, murderers and opium dealers who joined Dipanagara's forces i
Kédhu in the first months of the war (vAE no. 28, Smissaert to Elout, 14 Sep:
1828) and Dipanagara's use of bands of tramps and wong durjana was mentione©
by A.D. Cornets de Groot in Surakarta (KB, Cornets de Groot private coll. IXe
pt. 6. p. 15-16, A.D. Corners de Groot Jr. to A.D. Cornets de Groot Sr., 2
Aug. 1825). Dipanagara's use of the wong durjana as troops was severely criti-
cized in the Buér: KITLV Or. 13 XIV (Dhangdhanggula) p. 150:

these robbers

feel they are entering a market, Lord,
just to snarch food:

They are not fighting men.

Even today Dipanagara is still compared unfavourably with P. Mangkubumi
(HB 1) in some Yogyakarta circles because the latrer did not rely for support
on the wong durjana during his war against the Dutch (Interviews with B.P.H.
Adinegara, Yogya, Dec. 1971 and W.5. Rendra, Yogya, Feb. 1973). See also

further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 390, p. 405; Louw, vol. III, p. 90 and
Bat. Cour. no. 12, 21 Mat. 1827.

myang karilégipunliya padha denrusaka: this would-seem to refer to the bridges
on the two main roads leading out of Yogyakarta: one going N.W. to
Magélang, passing into Kédhu over the Kali Krasak near Muntilan, and the
other going eastwards to Surakarta over the Kali Opak at Prambanan. Dipa-
nagara's intentions were probably to break these communications in order to
starve Yogyakarta into surrender and to prevent Dutch reinforcements from
getting through, This was a tactical move which had earlier been envisaged by
Raden Rangga during his rebellion-in 1810 (see.Poensen, 'Amingku
IT, pp. 203-4) and by P. Dipasana during his revolt in Kédhu in Feb. 1822
when the bridge over the Kali Elo was broken (MyK 2464, BGG br, 7-16
Feb. 1822, nos. 7-10). In 1825, both Dutch and Javanese troops were
ambushed on the two main roads by Dipanagara's forces and most of the
bridges were destroyed (see Louw, vol. 1, pp. 266-71; dK no. 181, Smissaert
to Van der Capellen, 24 Jul. 1825; dK no. 183, 'Verklating van Raden Mas
Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825; De Klerck, vols. IV & V, Maps and Payen, 'Voyage',
24 Jul. 1825 who noted that the approach roads to Yogya were dug up and
obstructed with sharpened bamboo stakes).

atur simbah ...... a simbah is a gesture of homage, a respectful greeting or
mark of respect from a lower placed person to a higher, made by bringing the
two hands with palms joined to the forehead and the tops of the thumbs touch-
ing the tip of the nose (see GR, vol. I, p. 870).

kang samya sakit manaheldhadbongkolan Panewalmyang dbongholan Mantri lan
Tamping: dbongkol has the particular sense of premature and unjust dismissal
from one's office (see GR, vol. II, p. 376). In Yogyakarta many Bupatis and
lower officials had lost their positions by 1825 or had suffered a severe con-
traction in their landholdings. Already in 1803, the Yogyakarta Resident, J.G.
van den Berg, noticed that more Bupatis had been appointed to the

244

 

 

Babsd Dipanagara

Yogyakarta mancamagara provinces than there were kabupaten for them to
administer (Dj. Br. 20, Van den Berg, 'Memorie', (1803). Other Bupatis lost
their positions because of the annexations of Yogyakarta land made by Daen-
dels (Jan. 1811) and Raffles (Jun. 1812); the Babad BZdbab (BL Add. 12330,
XXVI 6-8, £. 85v-86r) mentions 10 Bupatis from the manceragara and from
Kéedhu who lost their positions and were forced to return to Yogyakarta. One
of these was R.T. Sumadipura, Bupati of Japan, who was later appointed as R.
Adip. Danuréja IV in December 1813. These sweeping annexations meant that
the lands which remained had to be split up amongst the Bupatis. Thus Van
Lawick van Pabst (Nota) noted that whereas in 1812 in Madiun there was only
one Bupati, by 1825 there were 7 for the same post (see further Louw, vol. I,
p. 520). Dipanagara himself later commented on the seriousness of the situa-
mon by asking what would be the fate of Yogyakarta if from every local head a
piece of land was taken away (Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 21). In the period immedi-
ately preceding the Java War many more officials lost their positions due to the
machinations of Danur¢ja and his supporters (see above n. 12). Massive sup-
port for Dipanagara from these prematurely dismissed officials was an impor-
tant factor in precipitating the outbreak of the Java War (see above n. 28).

Tamping was the title of a village official in the Yogyakarta area, who had the
task of overseeing the bridges and roads as well-as being entrusted with general
police duties outside the capital (Gericke, Jetaansoh-Nederduitsch Woordenboek,
p. 290).

40 .... Rahaden Dipati: the title of the Path, Raden Adipati Danuréja IV (see above
n. 7).

41 ... Wirmagara: was the son of Mas. T. Wiraguna, the Parih of the kadipaten
during Dipanagara's youth. He had studied Islamic law and mysticism at the
famous pathok of Mélangi just outside Yogya (see Carey, 'Further Note,
p. 342 n. 12) and was described by Chevallier (see Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage II, p.
599) as a 'lettered Javanese, acquainted with the history of his land and well
versed in the Quran', Many of Wiranagara's family were sanfris and some
fought for DN during the war, see Bat. Cour. no. 109.15 Nov. 1827. Wirana-
gara himself was a favourite parakawan of HB IV and was appointed as the
wedana gtdhe prajurit (commander of the Sultan's bodyguard) in c. 1818-1819
with the rank of Major ($B 136 (Babed Ngayegyaharte, vol. 11) X. 51, p. 38; AvJ,
p. bocxsiii and Louw, vol. I -p. 285 n.-l). .He was apparently of Balinese
descent like Danuréja from, Untung Surapati (see below n. 178) and was at one
time married to Dipanagara's eldest sister (Knoerle, Journal', p. 26; Bat Cour.
no. 100, 23 Oct. 1827 and Dwidjosoegondo, Serat Dharah, p. 103). But he
incurred the prince's enmity by conducting an affair with Dipanagara's step-
mother, the Ratu Aging (De Salis, 'Pro Memorie}, and he was able to influ-
ence her to side with Danuréja against Mangkubumi and Dipanagara (see
farther Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 358 and AN BGG, 20 Sept. 1832 no.

1). According to Payen 'Voyage', 10 Jul. 1825), he was mistrusted by many
Europeans in Yogya.

42 arsa karya Inlurung: most Javanese accounts state that the immediate reason for
the outbreak of the Java War was the decision to build a road through
Dipanagara's property at Tégalréja (LOr 6547 (Babad Dipanagara) b, XX. 69,
pp. 334-5; NBS 37 (Babad Dipanagara, Jayabaya version) I. 11-19, pp. 7-8;
dK no. 165, 'Translaat-verhaal Adiwinotto'; Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 4). The back-
ground appears to have been as follows: on 24 May Smissaert ordered
Danuréja to make improvements to various roads inside and outside
Yogyakarta (AvJ, p. cvi, Smissaert to Danureja, 24 May and see below n. 90
and n. 130). This involved the planting of trees and a general widening of the
roads so that they could be made passable for carriages. The side roads out-

side Yogyakarta which were to be improved were those to Plered and Kuths
G&dhe, and to Gamping (Ambarkatawang) (see MyK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar
1827, Litt. 31 no. 34, Anon, to HB II, n.d.). The latter was important for the
transport of lime to Yogyakarta (see n.21) .The Yogya babad (SB 136, XLVL
3, p. 189) also mentions a road from Pasar Kuncen, west of Yogya, which pass-
ed through Tompeyan, a village on Dipanagara's estate at Téegalr&ja, skirting
the eastern fence of the estate and then proceeding to Bulukatri where @
joined the main road to Gamping (see further SB 136, XXXVIII. 50-52, p.
161; Louw, vol. I, Map 3; Ibid., vol. III, Map 1). It is possible that the
enlargement of this particular side road precipitated the conflict (see the
report of Chevallier cited in Louw, vol. I, p. 139). Much annoyance was also
caused by the fact that grave-sites by the side of the roads to Kutha G¥dhe and
Imagiri were not treated respectfully by Europeans (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar
1827, Lite. 31 no. 35, Ratu Agéng & R. Ayu Hascuran to HB II, n.d. and see
further Kielstra, 'Een en Ander omtrent Dipo Negoro', p. 411).

Pangeran Dipanagaralaneng S¥arong maringi: in his babad Dipanagara mentioned
that he always went to the cave of Sécang at SElarong during the fasting month
(PuasalRamilan) (LOr 6547 b, XX. 8 p. 311) and he was there at the end of
the fasting month in May 1825 for he described the vision he received of the 8
walt wudhars on the night. of 27 Ramélan (16 May 1825) (see Louw, vol. I, pp.
133-38). His absence ar Selarong at that time is also mentioned in contempor-
ary accounts (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar. 1827 Litt. 31, no. 34, Anon. to HB
II, n.d. and Payen 'Voyage', 18 Jul. 1823). He returned to Yogyakarta for the
Garibig Puasa of that year which was held on 21.May 1825 (see below n. 152)
and he was at Tegalréja when the road through his property was begun to be
improved on 17 June (25 Sawal, AJ. 1752, the date is given in NBS 37, I. 14,
p. 7). In his babad he described how he saw workmen planting
markers (LOr.6547 b, XX. 70-80, pp. 335-9), and ordered his Patih to take
up the stakes (see further below ns. 45-46; 64).

mung panakawan tafilu: a panakawan has the special sense of an intimate
retainer of prominent people in Java. They are mostly young men who serve
without payment, but receive board and lodging. Their duties entail carrying
ornaments of state, keeping guard and running errands etc. (GR, vol. 11, p.
192). In Javanese society the relationship of apanakawen to his master is a
rather unique one-and is mirrored in the wayang (shadow puppet play) in the
relationship between Sémar, Gareng and Petruk, and the five Pandhawa
brothers. At thistime the Sultan of Yogyakarta had his own corps of
panakawans, called the Jaga-upa, made up of the sons of prominent officials
(see KITLV H 139 'Namen en Eer Tituls der kinderen van den Sultan, Prinsen
en Regenten te Jogjakarta' and see also BL Add. MS. 12341, f. 121r where four
Jaga-upa bidbaya (? male dancers) are mentioned). Dipanagara himself appears
to have had various penakawans: Puthut Lawa and Puthut Gurit were men-
tioned by him during his time at (see LOr 6547 b, XX. 50, p. 327)
and Sahiman, Rata and Bantheng-wareng were referred to later (see Knoerle.
'Journal', p. 22; LOr 6547 (Babad Dipanagara) b, XXI. 132, p. 370). The last
two accompanied him throughout the Java War (LOr 6547 d, XXX-VIII. 150,
p. 228). Sahiman was a youth of thirteen. All three shared his exile.

...... Lurab Kapidbak: on the Kapidhak see GR, vol. 11, p. 227. They appear to
have been a group of royal retainers who also fulfilled bodyguard duties at the
courts, thus during the Kartasura period the Kepédbaé referred to a company of
troops (note of Dr. M.C. Ricklefs and see De Graaf, 'Sultan Agung', p. 139). It
is in this military sense as bodyguards that they should be understood here, and
the nearest translation of Lerab Kapidhak would probably be 'Caprain of the
bodyguard'. In a later conversation (Knoerle, 'Journal', pp. 21-2), Dipanagara

246

Babad Dipanagara

azentioned that before the war he had a following of 200 picked men and more
shan 60 others just to look after his horses, so these may be the Kapidhak
referred to here.

In his babad, Dipanagara related that he was sitting by the ricefields just out-
side Selaréja when he saw a crowd of people and was informed by his Path,
Mas Mangunarja, that Raden Brangtakusuma, an official of the Danuréjan, had
been ordered by Danuréja to stake out the road. Dipanagara instructed Man-
gunarja to take up the stakes, but warned him not to use force unless he was
resisted. The account of the incident related in this babad accords well with
Dipanagara's version and with other contemporary reports (LOr 6547 b, XX.
70-80 pp. 335-338; XXL 1-15 pp. 339-343; MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar.
1827 Litt. 31, no. 34 Anon. to HB II, n.d.) The Lurzb Kapidhak could refer to
Dipanagara's Patih, Mas Mangunarja.

46 kanthi upas kantor Gustilkatindbiyan kalib Wiandi tukang jalan: the upas kantor
was almost certainly DanurZja's offcial, Raden Brangtakusuma, who was
ordered to supervize the placing of the markers. The two Dutch road overseers
are not mentioned in other babad accounts, but it is known that the Sultan had
such people in his service. Thus, in 1814, two road overseers are referred to
who were also entrusted with the- inspection of Dutch forts in the area. They
were paid 480 Sp.D. p.. by Sultan (Dj. Br. 29, R.C. Garoham, Statement
of annual expenditure in the Crarton of the late Sultan Hamangkubuana the
third', 1 Dec. 1814). Raffles also instituted the position of 'Superintendent of
the roads and bridges in the Native Princes Dominions', see De Haan, 'Per-
sonalia', p. 530.

47 Magirsari ......: one who lives on the estate of a Javanese noble or official. He can be
a servant or estate worker but is not always so. Usually he is required to perform
labour services and is liable for military service (note of Dr. Th. Pigeaud).
In the area around the villages of Tompeyan, Bulukatri and Jagalan
bordered on Dipanagara's estate and had ricefelds attached to them (see Louw, vol.
1, Map 3), Dipanagara himself described how villagers from Tompeyan seized the
krises of Brangtakusuma's men and drove them off. Later, Demangs and Mantris
brought the inhabitants from the surrounding villages to defend Dipanagara at
Tegalréja (LOr 6547 'b, XX. 77-9. pp.-337-8. XXI 3-4. pp. 339.40). This
account is confirmed in another source which adds the detail that after the skirmish
at Tegalréja, Brangtakusuma's- men-refused to have anything more to do with the
roads outside Yogyakarta and only consented to effectconstruction within the town
itself (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar. 1827 Litt. 31, no. 34, Anon, to HB II, n.d. and
Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 390-1).

I 48 .... kinap ...... from the Dutch (boy), meaning a guéviden, or a small table
to place a p, drinks or paper on (GR, vol. 1, p. 392). It is interesting to
note the number of Dutch words which are used in this babad. Thus, later (VL
25), the Dutch words for gin (/enerer) and for glasses (glas) are adopted in
Javanese form. The north coast Bupatis are also referred to as 'Regents' (Rigen)
(XII 19 and see n. 243). This could indicate a degree of Dutch influence on
kraton cicles even at this early period of the 19th century.

49 ..... Kumpini: this refers to the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oost-
indische Compagnie), the V.O.C., which had undergone liquidation at the end of
the 18th century and whose possessions had passed under the control of the
Dutch state. The word continued to be used in the 19th century by Javanese to
describe the Dutch colonial government, and the Dutch military and civilian
personnel in Java (GR, vol. 1, p. 538 and Louw, vol. III, p. 164). The term is
used here in a respectful fashion referring to the 'Government' in distinction to

seserred to here.

Historical Notes & Commentary

the term 'Wianda' (Dutch) which is used by the Government's opponents in a
denigrating sense; see also below n. 119 and XII, 14 where the distinction is
clearly made.

wiku-wikuning atigan ling frone isi kuning: in Javanese literature Arab preachers
are sometimes referred to as wiku 2ndbog ('egg-saints'), white outside but red inside.
Wiku indhbog is a very old simile found in the Old Javanese Ramayana. The hypocrite
is also sometimes compared to the treacherous heron in Indian mythology who
beguiled the fishes into trusting in him. In the Javanese wayang theatre an example
of such an 'egg-saint' is Drana (Kumbayana), the teacher of the Pandbawa, who
treacherously sends Bima on a dangerous errand (see G.W.J. Drewes, 'The
Struggle between Javanism and Islam as illustrated by the Sérat Dérmagangul',
BKI, vol. 122, (1966), p. 342, n. 19). This remark should be understood in the
context of the disparaging attitude of the Surakarta kraton scribe towards the
religious communities in general and towards Dipanagara's connections with
them in particular (see further above the Introduction pt. IV).

wong santri; the term sentri is used in other contemporary Javanese
sources, for example in the Bukz (see below n. 54) and can best be translated
by 'religious communities It did not have, the connotations of Islamic
orthodoxy which were later applied to it in the 20th century (see C. Geertz,
The Religion of Java, (New York, 1969), pp. 121-131). At this time three main
groups of sentris can be- identified: (a) kraton sentris, members of the Islamic
hierarchy in the kraton towns, mosque officials (Pengule, Kétb, Marbet and
Modin) and Aslamic legal scholars (alama, pathok nigara) who performed. their
functions at the Swrambi. (b) pradikan santris, religious teachers and jurukuncis
who lived in the pradikan villages (see below n. 101). (c) Independent religious
teachers (Kyais, gurus) who thrived as local teachers of spiritual disciplines and
mysticism in country areas. Their instruction was very heterogeneous and could
vary from bestowing magical charms (imaf) to orthodox instruction in Quran
exegesis. Often there was bitter rivalry between the latter group and the kraton
santris or those with official positions.

ilang churmating satriyainganggo churmating wong santri: the babad writer is
here drawing the distinction between Dipanagara as a member of the kraton
and his close connections with the religious communities outside. The term sa-
ria indicates the son or. close associate of the Sultan, a nobleman or a knight
(from Skt. Asattriza, one from the caste of the military men, see GR, vol. 1, p.
797). The babad writer is here criticizing Dipanagara for renouncing kraton sat-
ria values, which, as a prominent member of the Yogyakarta court, he would
have been expected to uphold (see the Introduction above pt. IV). It is an
enlightening observation, for later, jealousy between Dipanagara's kraton and
santri supporters, and in particular the rift between Dipanagara and Kyai Maja,
did much to precipitate Dipanagara's defeat during the Java War (see further
Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 19-21; Jar. Cour. no. 144, 2 Dec. 1828 and LOr
6553 LHlampahanipun Mas Somarija ing Wanartia), p. 33 where the dis-
tinction between safriz and santri is also made).

whanthi wong arakan: see above n. 36.

kaum santri iku bobote sapira; this disparaging remark fits again with the babad
writer's general attitude towards the santris (see above ns. 50 and 52, and the
Introduction pt. IV). It is interesting that in the Buz, a chronicle written
under the direction of an erstwhile Surakarta official (R. Adip. Cakranagara),
very nearly the same remarks were put into the mouth of the Surakarta Patih,
Sasradiningrat, in a conversation with Sunan Pakubuwana VI in Aug. 1825
KITLV Or. 13 (Buku Kedbung Kébo) XIV (Dhandbanggula), p. 150:

the santris cannot govern the state

Very different is the charisma of a king.

. Macanan ...: (lit. Tigers'), this was the name of the corps of police officials
in Yogyakarta who wore striped jackets and trousers. The Macanan Anirbraja
was also the name of a regiment of soldiers in the Surakarta kraton whose
officers bore the title of Sing# and the rank and file that of Macan. The Singa-
w#gara also functioned as sharpshooters for the rulers (see GR, vol. I, p. 890;
vol. II, p. 478; SW. no. 66, Pakubuwana VI to Kusumayuda, n.d. and IOL
Mack. Pr. vol. 2, 'Miscellancous Memorandum and- Notes on the court of Solo',
p. 209 which refers to a group of 100 'Macanan' infantry soldiers of the Sunan
who were armed with rifles.). It is possible that the former corps of police offi-
cials is meant here, The establishment of 'a regular and permanent system of
police' in Yogyakarta had been laid down by art. 7 of Raffles treaty with HB II
on 1 Aug. 1812, although, even before that date according to Van Sevenhoven
(see below p. 60), there was a reasonably efficient police force in the town.
According to J.D. Kruseman (NvB Port. 5, pt. 11, Kruseman to
Commissioners-Genéral, 17 Jan. 1817) the turn-out of these police officials
deteriorated rapidly during the British period (1811-16) and by May 1815, they
were no longer distinguishable from the rest of the population because their
uniforms had worn out, But some changes occurred after this under Danureja
IV with the appointment of more Gu»unge (village police officials who also
served as messengers for the kepatiban, LOr 6347 b (Babad Dipanagara) XNIIL
144-XIX. 1, pp. 274=5) and by 1822, Nahuys commented that the police force
was on a reasonably good footing again, NvB Port. .7, p. 6, Nahuys to De Salis,
Apr. 1822. On later developments see Rouffzer 'Vorstenlanden', pp. 644-45.

552 kang abdi Lurah Macanan/Macan Simbawa ranchi: the name Macan SEmbawa
is perhaps based on the demoniacal spirit Kyai Murti Sembawa, see LOr 12507

and LOr 12540 (both vols. in the Ir. Moens coll. pt. 2, which are described in
Pigeaud, Literature of Java, vol. TV, p. 55; p. 65.).

56 ... jajarira: BtkE is a subordinate official, perhaps here an officer of the

Macanan corps and the jajars refer to the rank and file (see GR, vol. 11, p. 414,
p. 693).

57 pinoleng bintulu abrit: refers to the variegated check pattern of the poleng loin-
cloth worn by the Marazar corps. The poleng incorporates 4 colours, red,
white, black and yellow, which symbolize the four super-deities Brama, Guru
(Siwa), Wisnu and Surya. In the wayang only Sang Hyang Bayu (the god of the
Winds), Bima, Hanoman and Dewa Ruci are allowed to wear this magical cloth
(Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese, p. 33 and p. 74; GR, vol.

Drama in Bali, (Kuala Lumpur, 1973), p. 53 n. 1, for a discussion of the origin
of this design).

58 whiran cara Bali/gayaman waranghanipun: various parts of the Javanese kris are
fashioned according to different shapes and patterns. The most important are
the number of curves on the blade (zk), the meteorite inlay on the blade
(pamer), the shape of the base of the blade (curiga), the handle (whiran), the
sheath (gendar), and the top of the sheath or guard (warangka) (see GR, II, p.
616; R. Tanojo, Serat Kacurigan, (Solo, 1938), passim). On the gayaman shape
which is carved after the form of the edible fruit of the gayam tree, see
Moebirman, Keris and other weapons of Indonesia Jakarta, 1970), p. 31 and
below n. 89). The fact that the Balinese style is mentioned here in conjunction
with the forms of the rier worn by the Macanan is interesting, for since the
time of Surapati (1686-1703) many Balinese had served as soldiers at the vari-
ous kratons in Central Java and had an important influence in Javanese military
circles. In 1813, for example, Crawfurd noticed that large numbers of Balinese
had entered the Sultan's and Prang Wédana's (MN II) service as members of
their bodyguard regiments (Dj.8r: 28, Crawfurd to Assey, 21 Mar. 1813) and
Balinese soldiers were recruited by the Dutch during the Java War, see Louw,
vol. II, p. 247 ff. Both: Wiranagara and Danuta, who were of Balinese des-
cent from Unrung Surapati (se below may have influenced the design
of the Maranan corps. Later, during the Java War, Dipanagara apparently
received many soldiers from Klungkung and Buleleng in Bali through the

connections of R.A. Mangkubumi who was herself of Balinese descent (see Knoerle,
'Journal', p. 37):

59 bibi ...: a Javanese man's dress consisting of a piece of cloth 414-5 feet in

length covering the lower part of the body and wound around the waist (GR,
vol. II, pp. 758-9).

592 aging inggil ing slab kadya rastksa: the image evoked here by the babad wri-
ter is that of the giants or Kurawa warriors in the Javanese wayang theatre.
Wayang wong and wayang topeng performances, as well as other forms of
wayang, were becoming increasingly popular at the Central Javanese courts dur-
ing the early part of the 19th century, and in Surakarta they thrived under the
discerning patronage 'of Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820) (see Hageman, Ges
chiedenis van den Oorlog op Java van 1825 tot 1830, p. 24; Winter, 'Beknopte
Beschrijving', p. 41-and Carey 'Cultural. 10). This prevailing inter-
est in theatre forms in Surakarea; especially the toayang ropeng, is clearly mark-
ed throughout the babad (see pr. IV of the Introduction above).

60 wong gimr kiplek myang kubuk: gimir is a game of dice played with a piece of
money or dice which is spun with the flick of the fingers and whereby the
chance depends on which side it falls, heads or tails or the number on the side
of the dice (GR, vol. I1, p. 617). Kip/ek is a game which uses three small coins.
One side of the coins are chalked white or marked in another fashion and then
thrown in the air whilst bets are laid on which side they will fall. It is a game
much favoured by common Javanese (GR, vol. I, p. 516), and Raffles, HJ, vol.
1, p. 351, also described its popularity with the baturs (porters). Kubuk is a
similar game which uses dice or pipe. These are usually covered with a cloth
(pakubukan) and bets placed on even or uneven numbers (GR. vol. I, p. 550).
Gambling of this nature, of which the games listed here are just a few (for
other contemporary games of chance see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 5), was
prohibited in public in Surakarta and Yogyakarta. It was only legal during the
nineteenth century in specially designated places usually presided by a Chinese
bandar who paid dues to the government authorities and often supplied opium
to his customers. The British administration attempted to abolish these gambl-

ing houses (see AvJ, Crawfurd to Raffles, 5 Aug. 1813), but they were reinsti-
cured under the Dutch (see NvB Port. 5, pt. 11, Nahuys to Commissioners
General, 6 Feb. 1817). The ordinary Javanese were addicted to gambling and
often played surreptitiously in public or in their own houses. This was particu-
larly the case with the baturs (porters) of the gladbag (see above n. 36). In
1812, Van Sevenhoven noted (KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 51) that
their passion for gambling was so great that at the resting places along the road
they immediately commenced playing!. Likewise, in his report on the region of
Kédhu written in the same year, Crawfurd remarked of the baturs in a similar
fashion: 'no sooner is their hire paid to them, than they may be seen sitting in
groups to gamble it away and they are altogether so impoverished that they go
nearly naked .... (IOL Mack. Pr. 21, p. 284). Van Sevenhoven, however,
noticed in 1812 that the police force in Yogyakarta was much more efficient
than that of Surakarta and consequently 'there were not so many bands of rag-
ged people playing on the roads and idling ... (KITLV H 503, 'Aan-
teekeningen', pp. 115-6). It is probable that the Macana» or their predeces-
sors were adroit at breaking up such gambling parties.

S1. ... titir muni: the titir is an alarm signal beaten out in a certain thythm on rice
blocks (blocks for hand hulling rice) withsat least two or three stampers to
warn the village or community) of robbery, murder or other
criminal actions (GR, vol. I, p. 650 and see Louw, vol. II, p. 484 for its use in
the villages during the Java War).

62 ..... kinthung ....: the thumping beat of the stampers-on the rice blocks (GR.
vol. 1, p. 409).

62a ... gogore pisan: there seems to be a play on words here. Gogor in Javanese
refers to a young tiger (macar), hence a young member of the Macaman corps
(?). See also below IV, 6 line 4 where there is a similar play on the word macar.

63 emas sadhacin 'dinar; dhacin refers to a weight of 100 karis (1 kati =
0.617 kgs.) (see GR. vol. II, p. 349). A #inar is a piece of gold worth about
one Dutch ducat (GR ol. I, p. 566), of these there were various types in cir-
culation: diner ici, worth £. 1.20-2.40; dinar talin, worth £. 5.50 (half a
sovereign); dinar wkon, worth £.-11-12 (one English sovereign); dinar rupiyah
worth f. 21-25, and a dinar ringgit worthf. 43-50 (see Th. Pigeaud, Javaans-
Nederlands Handwoordenboek, (Groningen, 1938), p. 68). For a list of
comparative values atthe end. ofthe, eighteenth century see Hageman,
'geschied-en Aardrijskundig pp. 335-7.

64 tan owah tanctbe lawas: the account given here in the babad of a series of
attempts to plant the markers is not fully confirmed in other sources. A con-
temporary letter described how the workers refused to work again on the road
to Tégalréja after the first skirmish (see above n. 47), and Dipanagara in his
babad related that the Patih merely ordered his men to block off the road to
Tégalr&ja at Jagelan. During the day Dipanagara's followers were able to clear
the road but at night it was blocked by the Patih's men. This happened three
days in a row. Only after Dipanagara's attempts to unblock the road had failed,
did armed men to start to gather at to defend the prince (LOr 6547
b, XX. 78-80, pp. 338-9; XXI. 1-15, pp. 339-43; Louw, vol. 1, p. 139 and
see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 391-2). According to Van Nes, 'Verhan-
deling', p. 158, bare pikes were placed by DN's followers at Tégalréja instead of
stakes as a sign of warlike intent.

-ing a very small difficulty (see P. Jansz, Practisch Javaansch-Nederlandsch
Woordenboek (Semarang, 1932), p. 989).

66 ..... Lurahe .... refers here to Macan Sembawa, the commander of the Macanan.
Lurah can refer to anyone who is in a position of authority (GR, vol. II, p. 98),
hence the title Kyai Lurab which is used later in the babad (IV. 8) by Wira-
nagara to Danurja. In kraton circles this is regarded as the correct address for
the Patih.

67 mas pucang: Areca Catechu L. (fam. of Palmae) (De Clercq, op. cit. pp. 171-2)

the areca or Pinang palmtree, whose dried, peeled seeds are used everywhere in
Java for betelnut.

68 ..... waringin: F. Benjamina L. (De Clercq, op. cit. pp. 237-8) the wood is
especially used for charcoal, but the tree itself is regarded with reverence in
Java as the abode of spirits.

69 sabasta pa(n)jangira: hasta is the length from a man's elbow to the tip of the
middle finger, a fourth of a fathom (from Skt, baste = hand) (GR. vol. 1, p.
94).

70 ana Kopral Macanan ran Matan Laut/...!kubut sadina sawingi: the short vig-
metre included here concerning Macan Laut is an interesting example of how
sometimes babad sources provide useful insights into social conditions of the
time. In the Buk a similar story is related about a Modin (mosque official) who
received one ringgit(1 Sp. D.) as his fee for praying at the funeral of Sukan
HamEngkubuwana, III. He took the money home to his wife who rejoiced
because their child had not eaten for three days (see KITLV Or. 13, II. 13-15,
(pp. 12-13). Wages seem to have been low at the time and clearly insufficient
for daily maintenance: the Babad Bidbah (BL Add. 12330, I. 6, f. 4v) describes
how the Sultan's gunners received only 8 reals (1 real silver = real bate =
£.2.40, see IOL Bur. F. 148/4, Raffles, 'Memorandum on Currency and Coin'
(1811) , pp. 173-4) in wages each year and were always short of food. The
baturs (porters) were paid 10-20 cents per day~(Van Sevenhoven 'Aan-
teekeningen', pp. 49-50) and the usual payment for labourers was 214 cents
per day with food being added (see below a. 133 and Louw, III, p. 577 on
payment of coolies during the Java War).-In his 'Report upon the District of
Pachitan', (21812-13) TOL Mack, Pr. vol. 21, pp. 169-70, Crawfurd reckoned
that the inhabitants of Pacitan subsisted on Sp. D. 10 per year for each family
(or 1.50 Java Rupees per man éach month). The staple food was rice and fish.
The cost of 1. pond of rice(453.6 grammes) was 244 cents, 1 pond of meat was
17}4 cents, 1 tan of oil was 40 cents, and 1 pong of south coast sait was 0.1
cent (14 cent if it came from the north coast), whilst the cost of buying a pair of
buffalo ranged from £.10.-16.00. Prices quoted here are taken from Dj. Br.
52, A.M. Th. de Salis to H.J. Domis (Resident of SEmarang), 14 Jan. 1823;
A.H. Smissaert to Batavia, 21 Jul. 1823 and IOL Mack. Pr. vol. 2, p. 214.

71 panjangira mung sadbipa; A dbipa is one fathom, the length of the chest with
both arms outstretched (GR. vol. II, p. 360).

72 was sakolah marang Bugis ...... besides the Balinese (see above n. 58), many
Buginese also served as mercenaries at the Central Javanese courts and had an
important influence on the marshal arts. The Sultan of Yogyakarta had two
Bugis regiments at this time, the Daeng Sefadipure with 106 men and the Bugis
regiment with 40 (dK 145, Waterloo 'Memorie' (1808). In 1813, Crawfurd also
remarked on the number of Buginese who took service with the Sultan and P.
Prangwedana (Mangkunegara 11) (Dj. Br. 28, Crawfurd to Assey, 21 Mar.
1813). The Patib of P. Paku Alam I, Daeng Aria Natareja, was also of Bugis des-
cent (Di. Br. 54, Smissaert to Comm. of Klathen, 3 Aug. 1825). In 1812 three

Babad Dipanagara

Buginese soldiers were sent to fire the powder magazine in the Dutch fort (BL
Add. 12330 (Babed Bedbabh, 11. 28, f. 111) and Buginese soldiers apparently
joined Dipanagara at Téegalr&ja at the outbreak of the Java War (KITLV Or. 13
(Buku Kibo) IX. 11, p. 89). It is very likely that Dipanagara had
Buginese to train his bodyguard (Kepédbak) because later, in his babad, he men-
tioned two Buginese captains, Rangga Daeng Makincing and Ngabehi Daeng
Marewa, who fought for him during the war (LOr 6547 d, XXXIV. 31 p. 77).
On the use of Buginese soldiers by the Dutch see Louw, vol. I, p. 327.

73 endba mitncak cara Cina: this refers to the péncak, the single stick fencing and
swinging in a Chinese war-dance which is known throughout the Indonesian
archipelago (GR. vol. II, p. 189, and for an excellent description of the origins
of the present-day Balinese p¥neak see De Zoete and Spies, Dance and Drama
in Bali, pp. 252-5). Single stick fencing was a great feature in Chinese monas-
teries from the sixteenth century onwards and the practice of it was combined
with the yoga-like exercises of the adept, The was also practised in
Javanese villages and was used in a peasant revolt in the early 20th century (see
Sartono Kartodirdjo, 'Agrarian Radicalism, p. 113). It is interesting to note
that the Kapitan cina of Yogyakarta, Tan Jin Sing, who was close to both
Dipanagara and his father (HB III) at the dime of the British attack on Yogya
(1812), apparently had the task, before the Jaya War, of maintaining Dipa-
nagara's bodyguard (DK no. 181, Smissaert.to De Kock, 13 Aug. 1825).

74 ingsun benggol kokok Kidbuldurjana ing De Klerck (vol. V, Map) shows
three places by the name of Parakan in Kédhu during this period. It seems
likely that the place to the north on the road from Téemanggung to Kretég is
meant here. It would 'have been an ideal spot for wong nr/ana to operate, for
the heavy traffic in cloth and, tobacco between Bagélen, Lédhok and Kédhu,
could be easily. robbed. and the surrounding hills used as bandit hide-outs (MvK
2774, BGG ir, 3 Apr. 1821, no. 23; Afdeling Statistick, De Residentie Kadoe
(Batavia, 1871).p. 96; Jav. Cour. no. 32, 13 Mar, 1828; Van der Kemp,
'Brieven' (189G),. p.. 584). There was apparently trouble there before the Java
War because the Bupati of Ménoreh appealed to the Resident of Kedhu to
improve the police force in Parakan so the inhabitants could be better protected
(MyK 2774 BGG ir, 3 Apr. 1821, no. 23). During the Java War itself a local
supporter of Dipanagara .in Parakan, Sétradipa, murdered the Bupati
Menoreh, R.T. Sumadilaga, and took the name of Tuménggung Kertaseluman
Sumadilaga (see Louw, I, pp. 310-20; I, pp. 90-91 and Jayadiningrat, 'Schet-
sen', p. 70).

75 nora pasab ing sisaning palu: Macan S&mbawa is here boasting of his
invulnerability. Followers of local Kya? in Java were often initiated into the
esoteric arts of ngelmy kadigdayan (warlike virtues), ngelmu kawidukan (the art
of striking fear), ngelmy kaslamitan (the art of invulnerability) and the use of
jimats (charms, amulets etc.) and rgjab (sacred texts) conferring protection
from danger. Parakan was later renowned as a centre for charms and weapons
(sharpened bamboo spears) bestowing invulnerability in battle (see Soejatno,
"Revolution and Social Tensions in Surakarta 1945-1950', Indonesia, 17 (Apr.
1974), p. 104 and on the use of the Ajf Limunan and other charms bestowing
invulnerability in 19th century Java see Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving', p. 82;
Raffles HJ, vol. 1, p. 297). At another place in the babad (see below VIII 15
and n. 168) Dipanagara's followers are described as having been given protec-
tion against bullets.

r entute muni dharudbut; continual breaking of wind in the Javanese context
of a battle scene is not always the sign of flatulence or fear. In the wayang it is
used as a means of self-defense by one of the most potent figures, the
panakawan S&mar (see Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese, p.
23).

Historical Notes & Commentary

77 maca tangawnt ping tiga: this refers to the Ar. ta'awwndb (1 take refuge in
God') from the prayer a adhu billahhi min ash-Shaitan ar-Rajim ('I take refuge in God
from the attack of the accursed Satan'). a vulgar curse in Java expressing horror and
disgust.

78 kongsi turun kaping pitu: the space of seven generations for an oath is a usual
period in Java. Hence in 1763 Mangkubumi vowed that none of his descendants
down to seven generations should marry a member of the Mangkunegaran fam-
ily (note of Dr. G.W.J. Drewes and see Ricklefs, Mangkwbumi, p. 114 and p.
344), and later R. Adip. Cakranagara was promised that seven generation of his
family should rule in Purwareja as Bupatis (see Carey, 'Javanese Histories', pp.
276-7 and Heather Sutherland, 'Notes on Java's Regent Families, part 11,
Indonesia, no. 17, pp. 4-5; see also below n. 178).

79 reyab-reyab feleb-ftleh ..... long hair was the mark of the satria warrior in Javan-
ese society at this time and it was usually worn in a long coiled knot and
tucked under the head-dress, hence the slight cylindrical protuberance at the

back of the b/angkon (head-dress). Thus, at a Residency party in Surakarta, a
European observer noticed how the Sunan's sons danced with their hair tied up
behind their head in a large bun and secured by a semi-circular comb of tor-
toiseshell, see Anon, 'Excursion to the Native Provinces of Java', (1854) p. 84.
Short hair indicated either a santr/- (student of religion) or one who was emp-
loyed by the European government, thus Javanese troops who served the
Dutch were recognisable by their close-cropped hair and during the 1812 crisis
Yogyanese who sympathized with the British could apparently be picked out in
the same fashion (Dj. Br. 22, G.W, Wiese to Daendels, 5 Dec. 1808; Poensen,
'Amingku Buwiok II (Séepub)/ p. 291). The Malays and Bugis also
wore their hair short (see Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 89). During the Java War
Dipanagara and many of his followers shaved off their hair as a vow after their
victory at the battle of Kasuran (28 Jul. 1826) (see LOr 6547¢, XXVII. 114-6,
p. 177 and Louw, vol. II, p. 497), After this, Dipanagara described the conten-
ders in the war as falling into three classes: the "believers' (his followers) with
shaven heads; the 'apostates' (those Javanese who fought for the Dutch) with
long hair, and, the 'unbelievers' (the Dutch and other Europeans) with close
cropped hair. One Yogyakarta prince (P. Abubakar) even cut off his pigtail
before joining Dipanagara at Sélarong at the beginning of the war (Dj. Br. 54,
Smissaert to MacGillavey, 7 Aug. 1825) and Chinese who supported Dips-
magara and embraced Islam were also ordered to have their pigtails cut, see
Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVI:

80 aneng lnbur papanggungan: papanggungan probably refers to a small building of
wood or bamboo with one storey which is used in Java as an oratory (langear)
(note of Dr. Th. G.Th. Pigeaud). It seems that such a building existed at Tegal-
réja for Brumund ('Bezoek', p. 194) noticed ruins on a small hillock amongst
the sawabs just outside the village, shaded by two old Afmaning trees with
three youis underneath, and, in his babad (LOr 6547 b, XX. 70, p. 335),
Dipanagara referred to the gt/hong (pavilion) at Selardja. From this place there
was a commanding view over the surrounding countryside and it was from here
that Dipanagara in his babad described how he first saw Danurja's men work-
ing on the road (LOr 6547 b, XX. 70-2, pp. 335-6).

81 gumujeng akuknb lathi: it is considered very bad form in polite Javanese circles
to laugh with one's mouth open. The Javanese usually cover their mouths
even if they do not laugh outright (note of Dr.Th.G.Th. Pigeaud).

82 panakawan kakalib; earlier (see above n. 44) Dipanagara is described as having
three panakawans. Here perhaps his two alder retainers, Rata and Bantheng-
wareng, are indicated.

Babed Dipanagara

anggris munggeng patadhan: it was important for a Javanese leader to dispense
largesse, especially after a successful battle. One of Dipanagara's panakawans
later described how the prince used to distribute alms to the poor outside his
pindbapa every Friday (Brumund, 'Bezock', p. 189) and during the Java War,
one of De Kock's spies reported a general distribution of money by Dipanagara
at the Puasa festivities of May 1826 (dK no. 119, Report of R.Ng. Natartja,
15 May 1826; see also Louw, vol. 1, p. 259 for a description of the distribu-
tion of treasure after the ambush at Pisangan on 28 Jul. 1825 (see n. 230) and
Bat. Cour. 12 Apr. 1827 on the rules for splitting up booty amongst DN's fol-
lowers in Kédhu in 1826-7). But some were obviously discontented with the
amount given. Thus one follower described how he only received two silver
reals from Dipanagara throughout the course of the war and how he was forced
to sell his clothes and ornaments to maintain himself (NvB Port. 12, pr. 8,
'Verklaring van Raden Hasan Machmoed, een gevangen muiter', 1 Aug. 1829).
One anggris (inggris) refers to a reyal inggris, one real of silver money, worth
+ £2.40 (GR. vol. I, p. 221 and De Haan, 'Personalia', p. 481).

wong sawij? limang reyal: five reals (silver) (real batu) = £.12.00; this would have
been a very considerable sum during this period, see above n. 70 and IOL
Eur. F 148/4, Raffles-Minto coll..-vol« 4, 'Memorandum on Currency and Coin',
pp. 173-4 for comparative prices, wages and monetary values.

kibon munggeng palatarany according to Javanese ideas a garden should be
placed at the back of a house- where the women-can enjoy ir. The front yard is
open to the public and should be planted with trees. The latter is referred to
here. According to Van Sevenhoven (KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 108)
the Yogyakarta Residency had a large ceremonial garden 'in the front with
three ponds encircled by trees (see further Louw, vol. I, Map 3. complex C).

kadya ytksendra Ngalingkal/duk myarsa patinirekilyaksa Ari Neltbur Gongse: this
refers to the scene in the wayang lakorn (plot 'PEjahipun Kumbakarna' (the death
of Kumbakamna), in the Remayana cycle of plays, in which the king of
Ngalengka (Ceylon), Rawana, hears of the death of his younger brother, Kum-
bakarna, at the hands of Lesmana. Kumbakarna's Aai@kter-(supernatural power)
lay in the joints of his limbs and these had to be hacked off one by one before
he could be killed. The Aekor which relates this episode is rarely performed in
Java so harrowing is its impact (see- Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the
Javanese, pp. 64-71). The comparison of Dutch officials with the bute (giants)
in the wayang or with-Kurawa warriors\ can, be found.in other contemporary
Javanese accounts (see BL Add. 12330 (Babad Bedbah) 1. 4, f. 4r; SB 144
(Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. 111) 111. 32, p. 10; Poensen, 'Amingku II
(SEpuh)', p. 241 and above n. 43 of the Introduction).

kadya wil Sang Pulunggana: Pulunggana is mentioned as a horse spirit with
Gareng as his groom in a series of wayang plays concerning the panakawans
(Pigeaud, Literature of Java, vol. I1, p. 683; Id., vol. I1, p. 352) and in the
Kidung Lalimbut, BL Add. MS. 12289, Pulunggana is described as residing in
Karta, Sultan Agung's former royal capital (see Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 405).
According to Ricklefs (Mengkebem?, pp. 27-31) Dutchmen in the late eigh-
teenth century were sometimes perceived in a manner similar to that in which
the Javanese viewed the panakewans, the clown retainers in the wayang. Thus
individual Dutchmen might be either humorous or worthy of respect. Here it
seems that Smissaert is being made fun of by the babad writer. It is interesting
to note that a contemporary Dutch official described Smissaert as 'a small, fat
and shy man' and at another place as 'a weak and insignificant person'. (Graaf
van Hogendorp, Wéllem van Hogendorp, p. 143; p. 146 and see below n. 152).
Another contemporary compared him with Sancho Panza (see above pt. IV of
the Introduction).

Historical Notes & Commentary

88 duk gendbong Sambe mamaling: it is not clear what particular wayang plot is
being referred to here though it may be a scene from the /akon 'Samba Ngeng-
l&ng, see C. Hookysas, 'Javaansche Uitgaven van Volkslectuur (Balé Poes-
taka), Djdwa, jrg. 12 (1932) nos. 2-3, p. 98, or a Sala version of 'Samba Mal-
ing'. Samba, the son of Prabu Krésna, is known in the Javanese wayang theatre
as a handsome but feckless youth, renowned for his glib tongue and amorous
successes (see Pak Hardjowirogo, Sedjarab Wayang Pura (Jakarta, 1963), pp.
110-1). Ngastina refers to the roval capital of the Kurawas in the wayang
theatre and the residence of Prabu Suyudana (Skr. Hastinapura) (GR. vol. II, p.
792). Sang Partasuta and Bambang Wilugangga are names for a son of Arjuna,
possibly Abimanyu (GR, vol. II, p. 58, p. 233; and see further Jaarbock san bet
Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genontschap, p. 374). Suralaya refers to the abode of the
gods, the heaven of Indra (GR. vol. I, p. 771). For references to the phrase
'midal réksa saking gunung' in association with sous of Arjuna see A. Jonkers
(ed.), Wangsatame Mamaling (Leiden, 1934), pp. 4-5.

89 Tuwan Sifalye pan kadyal .... dawa lamun cinarita: again the babad writer may
be referring to a scene from 'Samba Maling'. Madukara is a name for the abode
of Arjuna (GR. vol. II, p. 493)-and the phrase pure ing Madukara probably
refers to a son of Arjuna. This allusion may have a connection with Chevallier's
well known amorous exploits (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 313). The
gayam tree is the Invcarpas-&dulis Forst. (fam. of Leguminosae) (see De Clercq,
op. cit., p. 260) which has scented flowers and the flesh of the fruits are some-
times eaten or the pips cooked. Presumably 'an alcoholic drink can be distilled
from it. It is worth noting that, according to Smissaert, Chevallier used to
go for excursions around Yogya with the Patih~during which he would drink
alcohol in the open (vAE no. 28, Smissaert to King William. I. n.d. (? Sept.
1828)). The description given here in the babad may be drawn from this.

90 Nzabebi Wiraprana: in a Dutch source Wiraprana is referred to as 'the secretary
of Danuréja' (NvB 9.2, 'Dag-Register van den Assistent-Resident van Djok-
jokarta inhoudende aanteekeningen nopens het gebeurde van den 16 Juli tot
en met den 5 Augustus 1825%, (henceforth Chevallief, 'Dag-Register'), entry of
16 Jul. 1825), He gave the news of the developments at Tégalréja whilst
Danur&ja was 'away supervising the construction of the road between
Yogyakarta and. Klathen (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert, Wiraprana to
Danuréja, ? 15 Jul: 1825 and see below n. 130}.

$1 w. hadanurjan: this refers to the dalém (residence) and offices of Danuréja IV,
also known as the Zzpatibaw. According to Louw (vol. 1, Map 3, complex 5) it
was situated to the north of the kratort in the same site as it occupies today
(1973). Like the gladhag, the Macanan corps -were probably lodged near the
Aipatihan, see Jav. Cour. no. 27, 1 March. 1828.

92 denbucal mring sabrang-stbrung: the rumour that the Dutch were planning to
arrest Dipanagara and exile him overseas is related in the Be (KITLV Or.
13, VIII. 30, p. 86) and in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XX. 59-61, pp.
330-1), where Dipanagara described how even before the question of the road
had come up, he had been warned by the dismissed Yogya Kyai
Rahmanudin, that Dutch troops had arrived in SEmarang to take him prisoner.
These were probably Dutch reinforcements for their campaign against Bone in
South Sulawesi (182425) which left Java in Sept. 1824 and Jan. 1825 (see
Van der Kemp (ed.), 'Brieven van en aan Mr van de Graaff, vol. I, p. 163; vol.
I1, p. 226 n. 5). There was no intention of taking him prisoner at that stage. In
his diary ('Dag-Register\, 19 Jul. 1825) Chevallier stated that it was the Ratu
Agéng and Danuréja who first suggested that Dipanagara should be arrested
and the whole of 19 July was taken up with preparations for this without any-
thing being finally achieved. At about the same time, a servant of one of the

256

Babad Dipanagara

European inhabitants of Yogyakarta took the news of Danurtja's and Cheval-
lier's plans to Dipanagara (MvK 4194, 13 Mar. 1827, Litt. 31, no. 35, Ratu
Agéng and R.A. Hascuran to HB II, n.d.). The following day, 20 July, the
blacksmiths in Yogyakarta warned Dipanagara of the preparations for an attack
(see below n. 156 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 392 who related
that Chevallier had the idea of attacking DN on 18 July).

93 marang Kang Mas Adipatya/Sasradiningrat manawi: this refers to the Patih of
Surakarta, R. Adip. Sasradiningrat II (Jul. 1812-30 Jan. 1846) (Rouffaer, 'Vor-
stenlanden', p. 607). The title 'Kang Mas' (elder brother) is probably used
because Sasradiningrat was appointed earlier than Danurcja IV, and because
this is a Surakarta account (see above pt. IV of the Introduction).

93a luluranging pafembatan!......magari Ngayogyakarta: from the time of the
Giyanti settlement (1755) to the redrawal of the boundaries between the courts
in 1830-31, Yogyakarta and Surakarta lands in the richer central areas (ragera
agung) abutted closely on each other. On this see Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p.
624; and above the Introduction pt. IV n. 33.

94 lumampah kalib ing tungeal: There were in fact no agreements between the
courts regulating co-operation over-road construction at this time. Indeed, it
was not until 12-Oct. 1840 (15 Ruwah A.J. 1768), when the Anggér Gunung
was promulgated, that the duties of local officials with regard to road mainte-
nance were formally stipulated (see J.FT. Mayor (Res. Sala) to G.G., 11 Feb.
1841 in AN BGG 17 Feb, 1841, no. 16 and Sogripto, Ontwikkelingsgang, pp.
163-7). Road construction in the period before the Java War usually required
long negotiations which were often abortive, see MyK 2456 BGG br 4 Oct.
1820, no. 12 for co-operation between Surakarta and Yogy@ on the construc-
tion of the Téersana-Bulu-Rawa-Dalimas section of Daendels® highway (Postweg)
on the north coast. It does seem likely, however, that Smissaert made some
efforts at this time to put the roads in the Surakarta area. into order for on 23
Jun. 1825 he announced his intention of visiting rendbi Suku and the eastern
mancanagara provinces, and ordered Danuréja to see that the roads and bridges
were passable (AvJ, p. evi, Smissaert to Danuréja, 23 Jun. 1825). Smissaert
never left on his journey because of pressure of administrative work, but
Danur&ja did depart for Klathen to supervise construction (see above n. 90).

95 .... Ka(ng)jéng Tawan: "Honourable Sit, the usual Javanese address for the
Resident which probably dates from the period of Daendels (see above n. 9).

96 Tuwan Gor Dhitre ...; in the Yogya babad, Dietrée is also referred to as jurn-
basa Gor a reference to his first name of Godlieb (see above n. 31) (SB 135
(Babad Ngayogyakarta) vol. 1, XXXI 39, p. 123).

97 rereh ririb punikalpatitis sabarang lakulakidbik kang kalipatan: Danuréja
appears to have enjoyed a high reputation in Surakarta and in another source
he was praised by Sasradiningrar as 'an intelligent man, who, as well as being
acquainted with the Javanese laws, customs and habits was also mindful of the
needs of the Dutch government and his prince ..' (quoted in dK no. 111,
'Over het karakter van den Soesochoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de
prinsen en rijksgrooten', Nov.-Dec. 1829). This opinion was not echoed by
the contemporary Dutch accounts, most of which refer to his laziness, revenge-
ful spirit and besotment with women and riches, (see MK 4132, Van Pabst,
'Nota' (1826); dK 111 Van Nes to De Kock, 16 Dec. 1829). The good account
of Danurcja in this babad may reflect his reputation in the Surakarta Aipatiben
(see the Introduction pt. 111).

script and on the right in Dutch. Letters between the two courts had to be s«

. ngulama: a learned religious scholar (usually in figh law) is known as
in Arabic, as opposed to the lay folk who are known as 'awamm. The plural for
of '@lim', 'ulama' is used among non-Arabic speaking peoples, including <>
Javanese, to indicate both singular and plural (see Juynboll, HMW, p. 25
3). In Java the term alama is sometimes used quite loosely to indicate a maz
learned in some branch of Islamic science (GR. vol. I, pp., 125-6). is
Yogyakarta the centres for the lame were the pathok négara (lit. 'the pillars of
the state'), the schools (Pordbok) where figh law was studied. At this time these
were Dongkelan, Kasongan, Papringan, Plasa Kuning and Purwardja (see Ax]
pic-iic, 'Opgave van den Pengoeloe der landen aan Priesters afgestaan voor
het onderhouden van graven' (1832). The advice of the afamas was also taken

in the Surembi, the religious court (see above n. 12 and Rouffaer, 'Vorsten-
landen', p. 641, n. 1.).

 

«...Ki Taptajani: on this religious figure who may have had an influence on
DN during his youth see Carey, 'Javanese Histories', pp. 272-3.

pradikan ...: this refers to the domains exempted from taxation by the Sultan

The taxes levied in the area accrued instead to the head of the pradiken

domain, who was sometimes am w/ama or a Kyi, in return for services
rendered or to be rendered. There were four main sorts of pradikan areas and
villages. (a) Mijen desas; which were granted to a particular person or family

The taxes from the village and the labour services were used for the upkeep of
the incumbent The grant usually lapsed on the death of the incumbent

(b) Paknneen desas: (from Jay. kunci (key), hence jurakunci (key keeper), were
villages freed from labour services and taxes in return for the upkeep of the
graves of a ruler or walt (Islamic saint), or for the upkeep of a religious
institution, Usually there was no direct gift of land as in the pradikan desas.
(c) Kiputian desas; villages where the wong putian (religious folk) as opposed to
the lay folk (wong abingan) were assembled. These sometimes had a religious
institution attached and services were remitted or land directly endowed.
(d) villages where the land had earlier been given by a Javanese
ruler to a specially designated person and his descendants on condition that a
religious school was maintained or a grave kept up. One of the most important
schools (Mésantrens)-at this time was Tégalsari in Panaraga, founded by
Pakubuwana IL (1727-49), which thrived under the astute leadership of Kyi
Hasan Bésari I (1800-62) and iwas»described by Crawfurd in 1812, as the
main centre in Java for teaching santris destined for the practice of figh law
(IOL Mack. Pr. 21, J. Crawfurd, 'Remarks on the Nature and Condition of
Landed Tenures under the Native Governments of Java', p. 251). It was also
the main centre for the production of Javanese paper (dlzwang) see Dr. S.
Kovijman, Ornamented Bark-Cloth in Indonesia, (Leiden, 1963) pp. 38-60, and
further F. Fokkens Jr. 'De Priesterschool te Tegalsari', TBG, vol. 24 (1877),
pp. 318-36, and Id., 'Vriie Desa's op Java en Madoera', TBG , vol. 31 (1886),
pp. 447-517. For a list of pradikan areas in Yogyakarta during the pre-1832
period see AvJ, pp. ic-iic, 'Opgave van den Pengoeloe der landen aan priesters
afgestaan voor het onderhouden van graven' (1832) and for a later survey of
pradikan villages throughout Java see Register betreffende de Vrijstellingen door de
bevolking der Perdikan-, Pakoentjen- en Midjen-Desa's worden genoten, en de diensten
en leveringen, waartoe zij verplicht is (Batavia, 1888).

..«. Kétib Modin: these are both mosque officials, the latter having the duty of
calling the faithful to prayer (HMW, pp. 66-8; GR, vol. 1, p. 464, and GR,
vol. II, p. 494). In his babad, Dipanagara mentioned that the KZ#bs, Modins and

258

 

Baad Dipanagara

Marbers from Yogyakarta accompanied by the Pingulu came to him at Sélarong
LOr 6547 b, XXII. 89, p. 396).

ts Kai Pangulu: a Dutch source (KITLV H 76, 'Boedel van (Sultan)
Hamengkoe Boewana IV', pt. 2) mentioned that the Yogyakarta Pingaln rallied
Dipanagara with 42 of his followers, amongst whom were many mosque
fcials. This is confirmed in Dipanagara's babad (see above n. 102). Dipa-
magara also referred to the old Péngu/s of the Ratu Agéng, Muhamed Bahwi,
whom he appointed as the commander of the Buléio corps (see Louw, vol. 1, p.
468). The erstwhile P¥rguln of Yogyakarta, Kyai Rabmanudin (1812-1823),
who departed on a pilgrimage (ba/) to Mecca shortly before the outbreak of
the war (LOr 6547 b, XX. 65-9, pp. 333-5), was also a close friend of
Dipanagara.

WH Kyar Nitiprafa ...: this refers to the chief magistrate of Yogyakarta, the
Wilana jaksa, who had a following of 26 officials (see above n. 12). A Dutch
report (KITLV H 76, pr. 2) mentioned a certain Ngabehi Nitipraja as having
joined Dipanagara and he is also referred to in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547
d, XXXII 54, p. 8). Nitipraja's son, a dismissed pathok négare, was appointed
as Dipanagara's chief magistrate in his father's place in c. 1828 (LOr 6547 d,
XXXII 56, p. 9 and see above pt. IX and n: 221 of the Introduction).

..... juru Suragama: this was a bodyguard regiment of the Sultan, made up of
religious officials and sentris. In 1808 Waterloo (dK 145, 'Memorie') described
the regiment as numbering350 men armed with ér/ses, daggers and carbines,
and dressed in long white robes (wbab), white turbans and white trousers.
They marched barefoot 'and were led by drummers, tambours and pipers.
Another priestly: regiment was the Swranaten, which was very similar to the
Suryagama, and with which Dipanagara himself had close associations (see dK
165 'Translaar-verhaal Adiwinotto'). In 1808 the Surznaten' regiment com-
prised 40 men, dressed in white jackets and long white pants (dK 145, Water-
loo, 'Memorie'). They were described by LW.C. van den Berg as the 'court
chaplains' (befkapelaans) of the Sultan and there was a special Suranatan mos-
que near the kadipaten ('De Mohammedaansche Geestelijicheid', pp. 33-4). In
the Buku both these priescly regiments are described as having gone over to
Dipanagara at Tégalréja (KITLY Or. 13, IX. 11-12, pp: 89-90) and the deser-
tion of 30 Hajis from the Suryagama corps is mentioned by Smissaert (Dj. Br.
54, Smissaert to P.le Clercq (Res. of Kédhu), 6 Aug. 1825). Both the corps
were reconstituted as personal bodyguard regiments by Dipanagara during the
Java War (LOr 6547 ¢, XXV. 218-9, pp. 137-8; Id., d, XXXVIII 10, pp.
201-2, and see A.S.H. Booms, Eenige bladzijden uit de Nederlandsch-Indische
brijgsgeschiedenis, 1820-1840, uit de Mémoires van F.C. Gilly de Montela, (Ams-
terdam, 1911), p. 34).

106 nyirnakén Walonda Cinal...Muchamad ingkang rinasul: the hope that both
Europeans and Chinese would become Muslims and join Dipanagara can be
seen in various contemporary documents. Thus, in his proclamation to the peo-
ple of Jabarangkah (near the north coast), Dipanagara gave orders that Chinese
who embraced Islam should be spared (see Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage LVIII) and at
the end of the Java War he expressed the hope that some Dutchmen remaining
on Java would become Muslims (see Carey, 'Javanese Histories, p. 285, p.
287). The process of 'becoming a Muslim' was very simple: thus the Chinese
had to have their pigtails cut off and be circumcised. One Dutch official, Lt.
Daniel Portier, who was captured by Dipanagara's troops was even given an
administrative position after he had proved that he had been circumcised (difs-
lamake) and adhered to the articles of the faith (sabadat) (see below n. 244 and
see De Graaf, 'De Regering van Sultan Agung, p. 102 for a discussion of
Agung's attempts to have Dutch prisoners circumcised), There is also evidence

  
 

239

Historical Notes & Commentary

that some Chinese rallied to Dipanagara at various stages during the Java War
or supplied him with money and arms (see Palmer van den Broek (ed.) 'Ges-
chiedenis van het Vorstenhuis Madoera', TBG, vol. 20 (1973), p. 561; AN
BGG ir, 9 Jul. 1832, no. 5; Payen, 'Voyage', 17 Sept. 1825; Louw, vol. III, p.
444). Before the war a few Europeans and Chinese had apparently become
Muslims for various reasons: thus the interpreter, Dietrée, was reported to
have been a devout Muslim (see Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 15) and the Yogya Kapi-
tan cina, Tan Jin Sing, embraced Islam when he was appointed as a Taming-
gung in 1813 (see P.J. Veth, Java, vol. II, p. 307 and above n. 73).

But on the whole, in the early stages of the war, when Dipanagara was very
much under the influence of his sanfr/ advisers, the conduct of the war was
marked by considerable xenophobia and both Europeans and Chinese were
particularly singled out for attack. Thus in Dipanagara's letter establishing
Angawicana as chief of the bandit forces in the Yogya area (see above n. 36)
there were special orders to go against the 'Dutch, the Chinese, the Moors
(non-Indonesian Muslims in general) and all members of overseas nations'.
Similarly in the Arabic prayer used by Dipanagara's followers for the dis-
comfiture of their enemies, bitter hatred of all foreigners can also be seen (dK.
no. 167). In Kedhu and Pacitan, Chinese land renters (tax farmers), European
land tax inspectors and supervisors of cultures were attacked and killed (dK no.
182, P.H. Breton van Groll (Sec. of Kédhu.Res.) to Batavia, 28 Jul. 1825; dK
no. 181, 'Report of J. Wormer; deputy inspector of cultures in Pacitan', 11
Aug. 1825). Likewise in the eastern mancenagara provinces, especially along
the Sala river at Ngawi and in Rémbang, many Chinese were massacred in the
early months of the war (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 522-5, p. 545, p. 561, p. 584 and
Payen, 'Voyage', 10 Aug. 1825 who noted: ... partout les Chinois sont mas-
sacré(s): on n'pargne ni femmes ni enfants). Although the total Chinese population
in Central Java was not large, in 1803 the Durch reckoned that there were some
25,000 Chinese (Chinese of mixed descent) domiciled in the area
(Dj. Br. 47, M. Waterloo to N. Engelhard, 30 Nov. 1803), many were dispersed
in the villages where they exercised considerable economic control over the local
trade. Their activities as money-lenders and tax-farmers also added to local dis-
content (see Carey,-'Origins', pp. 65-7). Thus economic grievances deepened
the widespread religious hatred of the Dutch.and the Chinese. But later there
were examples of tolerance especially amongst DNs court supporters: Dipanag-
ara himself took a Chinese girl as his mistress (LOr 6547 c (Babad Dipanagara)
XXVIIL 13, p. 227; Louw, vol. , p. 517 n.) and had a Bengali as his personal
physician and herbalist:(Garey, 'Sepoy, p. 310).

106a dediya somodra gitibl......!nora sdya sun unduri: it is worth noting that Dipana-

107

gara's speech here stands in sharp contrast to his reply to the Rate Adil,
in his babad in which he begged to be excused from waging war because he
was not strong enough to fight and could not bear to see death (see LOr 6547
b, XX. 16-17, p. 314; Louw, vol. 1, p. 131).

kasthut ing daltm kitablTanah Jawa Ratu Adil: the kit«b mentioned here is
almost certainly the Kitab Musarar, which contained the prophecies divulged to
the legendary king of Kédhiri, Prabu Jayabaya, by the sage Maulana Samsu Jen
from Turkey (Ngrum). The prophecies depicted the cycles, based on the Hindu
kali-yuga cycles, which after periods of decline would result in the appearance
of a 'Just King, the Javanese Rate Adil (see further Drewes, Drie Javaansche
Goeree's, pp. 130-7; Wiselius, 'Didjd Bajd, p. 181; Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p.
31 and pp. 53-4). Dipanagara clearly was aware of these prophecies because
he later described them in Book I of his Makasar MSS. (see Makasar MSS. pr.
1, pp. 50-53).

Babad Dipanagara

8 mee Wau» sas? Suraljumeninge Ratu Adil: historical evidence points to the fact
mur Dipanagara was planning an uprising to coincide with the first month (w-
=#> of the Javanese year Wawu (see above n. 34). According to Dipanagara's

account, he took the tile of Sultan Ngabdulkamid Erucakra on 1 Sura A.J.

753 (15 Aug. 1825) at Sélarong on the prompting of Kyai Maja and Kyai

KswEron from Kédhu, (see below n. 218), thus confirming this babad's

description. Dipanagara's adoption of the title of Ereeakna indicated clearly that

e was assuming the mantle of the Ret# Adi! (see Cohen Stuart, 'Eroe Tiakra',

pp. 285-8, and Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p. 27 fF.) In an early eighteenth cen-

mary recension of the Pralembang Jayabaye (the prophecies of Jayabays) the
month of Muberam (Sura) is depicted as the time when the Ratu Adil will
appear (see Brandes, 'Protorype', p. 386). The month of Sura is also important

im Java as a traditional time for the renewal of dynastic power, hence the cere-

ssomy in the Central Javanese kratons on the eve of 1 Sura for cleaning the

state pusake (regalia) and bearing them in ceremonial procession around the
capital. The labuban ceremony at Parang Tritis when the Sultans of Yogya pre-
seat offerings to the goddess of the Southern Ocean (Ratu Kidul) likewise used

s occur in the month of Sure, see J. Groneman, In den Kedaton te Jogjakarta

Leiien, 1888), p. 13 n. 1. It was also an auspicious time for the founding of
sew dynasties, thus himself as Suswbunan in Kabanaran
sear Yogyakarta on 1 Sura A.J. 1675 (12 Dec. 1749) (See Ricklefs, Mang-
éubumi, p. 54). The Javanese year Wawn may have also had connections with
messianic expectations. It is significant, for example, that Raden Rangga's revolt
in Madiun, which was messianic in character, in a Warz year
Nov.-Dec. 1810/A.J. 1737) (see Poensen, 'Amagku "IT', p. 200 f)
and that in 1888 prophecies circulated in Java that the end of the year Waw» would
be the time when the kingdom of the Retw Adil would be established (see Sar-
tono Kartodirdjo, 'Peasants' Revolr', p. 272).

sons of Kyai Taptajani had sertled in Surakarta where they enjoyed the patron-
age of Pangeran Buminata.and were later given 300 cacebs of land in the area
Taptajani's sister was also married to Kyai Musa, an #/eme pradiken of Kedhu,
who together with his son, Kyai Iman Gajali, joined Dipanagara (see below n.
110 and Dj. Br. 49, M. Waterloo to N. Engelhard, 22 Jun, 1805).

110 ing Maja Badberan sampuniPulo Kadang samya nganti: Maja and Badheran were
two pradikan villages in the Pajang area slightly to the north of Délanggu. Pulo
Kadang was another pradikan village near Imagiri which is mentioned by
Jayadiningrat as having given help to DN (see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 13;
Jas. Cour. no. 9, 19 Jan. 1828; De Klerck, vol. IV, Map, and SW no. 88, Mas
Pangulu (Surakarta) to Kyai Maja, n.d.). The two former villages were associ-
ated with Dipanagara's famous religious adviser, Kyai Maja, and his father Kyai
Badheran (Abdul Ngarip). The latter was a Kéib Iman, who was named as
ulama pradikan of Badheran by Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820). His tasks were
to pray for the welfare of Surakarta, to hold religious services on Fridays, to
give religious instruction to the santris of the village (according to De Stuers,
Mémoires, p. 15, the village of Maja contained a large library of Arabic MSS.
which were used for public instruction) and to go to Surakarta whenever the
Pengulu called a state meeting. Before his death he was given the village of
Maja as an additional pradikan benefice and was buried there. His first son,
Kyai Wirapatih, succeeded him as pradikan of Badheran and took over the title
of Kyai Kiib Iman. His youngest son, Bagus Kalipah, was appointed as

Historical Notes & Commentary

pradikan of Maja and was entrusted with the instruction of the santri. He
became known as Kyai Maja, and like his father before him he numbered mans
members of the Surakarta kraton amongst his pupils, exercising a great influ-
ence there, even at times gainsaying the authority of the Surakarta Penguls
(LOr 6547 c, XXVII 13-14, p. 188; NvB Port. 11, pr. 11, Report of Mas
Pangulu and Sasradiningrat, Surakarta, Oct. 1828). He apparently carried letters
from the Raja of Bali Buleleng to PB IV during the British period (1811-16)
and was imprisoned by the British at the Surakarta éZpatiben for a while. Later,
during the Java War, he was given a wife of Balinese descent by Dipanagars
(Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 23). Dipanagara's connections with Kyai Maja stemmed
from the period of Nahuys van Burgst's Residency in Yogyakarta (1816-22),
when he travelled on foot to Maja to find his eldest son who had become a
pupil there (De Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI. pp. 744-5 and LOr 2182 pr.
3, 'Berigt omtrent Kyai Maja', 20 Oct. 1833). He was deeply impressed by
Maja and summoned him to $élarong together with Kysi Kuwéron from
Kéedhu at the beginning of the war (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 75-7, pp. 392-3), but
he later fell out with him. Maja had never made the pilgrimage (647) to Mecca,
but so perfect was his knowledge of the Qur'an and the rules laid down in it
that even religious figures who had often been to the Holy City recognised his
superiority (De Klerck, vol. V, p. 742). De Stuers (Mémoires, p. 15), however,
remarked that Kyai Maja, who was about 36. years old in 1828 and was small in
stature, had avery cruel character: it was he who organised the ambush which
led to the murder of the Sultan's guardians in July 1826 and he exercised great
intellectual and military ascendancy over Dipanagara (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 154;
vol. I11, pp. 60-63). Maja's family connections were extensive: he had a son(?),
Kyai Imampura, who studied at the pétantren of Tégalsari (LOr 2163 (Buke
Kidhung Kibo) XV. 96-8, p. 198) and amongst his other relations who went
over to Dipanagara were Kétib Iman Badheran, Muhamad Ngali from Karang,
Tumenggung Résanégara from Pulo Kadang, Kyai Hasan Bésari, Bésari's son,
Bagus Eliss (Tumenggung Pajang) and Kyai Iman Gajali (a nephew of Kyai
Taptajani), When Maja was captured by the Durch in Nov. 1828 he had with
him 19 followers from Maja, 3 from Pulo Kadang and 2 from Badheran (NvB
Port. 11, pt. 11, (Namen en woonplaatsen der gevangenen met Kijaji Modjo',
16 Nov. 1828, and for details on Maja's family see LOr 2168 no. 108; SW no.
88, Mas Pangula-{Surakarta) to Kyai Maja, ad.; LOr 8652 k no. 3, 'Silsila Kyai
Modjo, Tondano', Menado, 15 Dec. 1919). Kyai Maja died in exile in Tonsea
Lama (Minahassa) in Dec. 1849 (see Sagimun, op. <., p. 406).

112 inghang rama aglis rawublKangfing Pangran Manghubumi: this refers to Mang-
kubumi's first visit to Dipanagara at on Thursday 14 July which was
reported to by Ngabehi Wiraprana (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaett'
mo. 12, Mas Ng. Wiraprana to DanurBja, 15 Jul. 1825). During this visit,
Wiraprana stated that Mangkubumi attempted to give Dipanagara 'good advice,
but that the latter paid no attention because 'his thoughts were confused" (zijre
gedachten verwardt zijn). Wiraprana reported that all the inhabitants at Tegalr&ja
were making preparations for resistance, the twwa burs (tiger hunters) from
Jél&gong near the Praga river had been ordered to prepare their arms, various
Puasa taxes had been remitted to Dipanagara's vassals to buy arms and food,
and the wong durjana to the south of Yogyakarta had been summoned (see
above n. 36). A Démang from the village of Grojogan in the Pajang area near
Surakarta was also on the march to join Dipanagara with over 100 of his rela-
tions and followers (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 22-3, p. 344; NvB Port. 9, pt. 2,
MacGillavry to Smissaert, 16 Jul. 1825; MyK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', MacGil-
lavry to Smissaert, 19 July, 1825, and Aukes, Legion, pp. 62-3 where the let-

ter is printed in full). Mangkubumi's visit to Tégalr&ja thus took place against a
background of hardening resistance there (see also Payen, 'Voyage', 16 Jul.
1825; 18 Jul. 1825), According to the account given in Dipanagara's babad
(LOr 6547 b. XXII. 24-36, pp. 390-3), Mangkubumi inquired of Dipanagara
why there were so many armed men assembled and he was given the reply that
they were there of their own free will because they had heard the rumour that
the Dutch wished Dipanagara harm. Mangkubumi said that he knew nothing of
this and asked his nephew to give the assurance that no incident would occur
in Yogya. This Dipanagara refused to do unless Mangkubumi first gave the
assurance that the rumour was false. When Mangkubumi in turn demurred,
Dipanagara replied that the only promise he would make was that he would
make no moves against Yogya unless he was himself attacked (see further Van
der Kemp, 'Hamlettype, p. 333; Kielstra, 'Een en Ander omtrent Dipo
Negoro', p. 412).

113 Pangeran AdinagaralAdiwinata satunggil: there is no mention in Dipanagara's
babad thar Mangkubumi was accompanied by these relations on his first visit.
The first prince was a younger brother of Dipanagara by another mother who
joined him at Sélarong on 21 July and was given the title of P. Suryenglaga
(see below X. 32; n. 214; Dwidjosoegondo, Sérat Dharab, p. 102; dK no. 158
'Naamlijsten van Djokjosche hoofden'). Adiwinata was a younger brother of
Mangkubumi who also joined Dipanagara later at Stlarong (Serat Dhara, p.
100; dK no. 183 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso'). Neither was there-
fore a son of Mangkubumi, but the term 'putra' is. often used loosely in Javanese
to indicate a blood relationship.

114 aneng madyaning pandbapa: a large pavilion in front of the houses of Javanese
chiefs and nobles where male guests are received (GR, vol. II, p. 200).
Brumund on his visit to Tégalr&ja remarked on the which was large
and spacious, and entirely built of stone ('Bezoek', pp. 184-5). In his babad,
Dipanagara described how he met Mangkubumi in the p¥rabape at Tégalréja

during the latter's second visit (see below VIL 11; LOr 6547 b, XXI. 59, p.
342).

115 aywa sulaya ing tekadinunggala sapati-urip; such a reply in Javanese terms need
not imply complete agreement. In the kraton, official sessions usually ended
with a royal pronouncement of the consensus (w#Pakar) of the meeting to
which courtiers normally replied sand/ka (whatever you wish"). Sometimes,
however, individuals could respond with date» Prggana (1 will not oppose
you') which often meant that opposition was a recognized possibility (see Rick-
lefs, p. 24). In fact; Mangkubumi only made up his mind to join
Dipanagara after his second visit to Tégalréja on 20 July 1825 and his mis-
treatment by Smissaert (see below ns. 134 & 141}.

116 prajurit jro sadayeki: see dK. 145; Waterloo, 'Memorie' (1808) for a discussion
of the Sultan's bodyguard and full details on the state of the regiments in
1808. The Buku mentions that the Mantri Jéro, Pinilih, Katanggung,
Nyutra, Mandhung, Wirabraja, Brajataka, Suranata, Daeng, Pancas and
Suryagama regiments went over to Dipanagara whilst he was still at Tégalréja
(KITLV Or. 13, IX. 10-11, p. 89) and in his babad Dipanagara described how
the Pinilih, Mandbung, Mantri Jero, Suryagama and Suranata were reconsti-
tuted under his command (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 88-94, pp. 54-5).

117 seba ingkang eyang sampuniPangeran Mangkualami: it is most unlikely that this
visit to Paku Alam I (1813-29) ever took place. It is not mentioned in any of
the Javanese or Dutch sources, apart from a small coloured drawing in the
Buku (KITLV Or. 13, p. 107b) which purports to depict a meeting between
the two men, but most probably refers to Mangkubumi's visit to Tégalréja. On
the contrary, it seems that Paku Alam and his relations were foremost in

263

118

Historical Notes & Commentary

opposing Dipanagera. Thus, on the morning of 20 July, Paku Alam mobil-
ised his 'Legion' (personal army) and this took part in the attack on Tégalréia
(LOr 6547 b, XXI. 89, p. 359; MvK 4132 'Bylage Smissaert' no. 12, Smissaert
to Batavia, 20 Jul. 1825, but see Payen, 'Voyage', 23 Aug. 1825 who described
PA's troops as being as useless as the bodyguards of the Preanger Bupatis)
Dipanagara did, however, make one attempt to win Paku Alam over when he
was at Stlarong on 26 July, but this proved fruitless (Chevallier, 'Dag-Register,
26 Jul, 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 26 Jul. 1825). It is also interesting to note that
in his conversations with Knoerle ('Journal, p. 14) Dipanagara remarked that
'Mangkubumi and Paku Alam had always been infuriated by the actions of the
government, but that they had not the courage to break with them..... This
seems to confirm the description given here in the babad. It could be said that
Dipanagara's estrangement from Paku Alam was of long standing and went
back to the troubles of 1808-12 when the latter was involved in intrigues
against the Crown Prince, Dipanagara's father (see Poensen, 'Amingku Buwind
I, passim). Paku Alam also suspected that the Crown Prince had arranged for
his banishment to Batavia in 1811, an exile in which both he and his son nearly
lost their lives (see Poensen, 'Amingku Buwind IT', pp. 242-51; IOL Eur. F
148/24 pt. G, Crawfurd to Raffles, 13 May 1812). After 1812, Paku Alam
became an intensely unpopular figure in the: Yogya kraton and his appointment
as Regent during the minority of HB IV aroused feelings of dismay (see Louw,

vol. I, p. 43 n. 1, quoting a letter from-Garnham to Raffles, 24 Nov. 1814).
His corruption and abuse of his position was the reason he was not

appointed: as Regent of HB V in 1822 (see MyK 4132, Van Pabst 'Nota'
(1826); Louw, vol. I, pp. 449-53),

rumaos nagari/Ngayogyakarta punika: this refets to Paku Alam's unique
position 'as an independent prince in Yogyakarta. Because of the Sultan's
youth, he was the most influential person outside the kraton.

wus dadi bongsa Kumpent: this refers once again to Paku Alan's position as an
independent prince in Yogyakarta answerable directly to the Dutch Govern-
ment rather than to the Sultan (see Van Deventer, Het Nederlandich Gezag, pp.
333-5, and Louw. vol. II, p. 425 where Paku Alam is quoted as referring
to himself as a 'Gzp¥rnZmen punya orang!). The term which is used here, dads
bongsa Kumpini, is interesting as an-illustration.of the changing loyalties which
many Javanese felt at the time as the power of the European Government came
to be more firmly «established in Central Java.. A somewhat similar phrase is
used in the Buku when \Cakranagara was presented with a military order by

Col. Cleerens in recognition of his help to the Dutch forces in Bagélen. LOr
2163, XLII (Dhandhanggula) p. 532:

68. Saya kasih kabar sama Kyai/lu sandenya jadi orang Blanda/sudah dapat
bintang gédhe/....

68. I give you the news Kyai,/it is as if you have become a Dutchman/for you
have won the great medal....

inghang Ihu Sri Bupati: this seems to refer to the Ratu Agéng, the grandmother
of HB V rather than to the child Sultan's mother, the Ratu Kéncana, The
former continued to be known as the Sorf (Queen Mother) in kraton circles
even after she inherited the title of Ratu Agéng on 21 May 1822 (28 Ruwah
A.J. 1749) (see AvJ, PB V to HB IV, 28 May 1822; SB 136 (Babad
Ngayogpakarta, vol. 11) XXXII 9, p. 135; LOr 6547 b, XVIII. 125-6, p.
270). She was the daughter of the Bupati of Rajégw&i, RT. Sasradiningrat,
sister-in-law of DanurZja IV and stepmother (Iz Kwalox) of Dipanagara.
Hageman characterized her as a sensible woman (Geschiedenis, p. 38), and as a
senior guardian of the young Sultan she had influence in the kraton and often
gave Dipanagara advice, attempting in the latter stages before the war to act as

# moderating influence on him (LOr 6547 b, XX. 24-38, pp. 317-22; Yogya
kraton MS. A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran) p. 79, Ratu Agéng to Dipanagara, Sura
A.J. 1751 (Sept. 1823); Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 310; pp. 380-81 and
see below n. 145). Payen, 'Voyage', 6 Aug. 1825 described her as a woman of
great dignity (sans avoir de beaux traits, elle conserva beaucoup de dignith et rep-
résente fort bien). So it is likely that if this visit of Dipanagara to the kraton took
place he would have met her. The Ratu Kéncana, a daughter of Danur&ja II,
carried little authority in the kraton and after the death of her husband (HB
IV) suffered from periodic bouts of madness (see Dj. Br. 33, Smissaert to

Batavia, 28 Feb. 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 9 Aug. 1825; Hageman, Geschiedenis,
p. 40).

U21 nwwun pusaka wangkingan!......Kyai Palered lan malibiKyai Sangkélat pinundbut:
Kvai Plered is one of the three pusaka aging (great regalia) of the Yogya kra-
tom, the others are Kyai BEéthok and Kyai Kopek. It is the weapon (a lance)
with which Ki Pamanahan of Mataram killed Pangeran Aria Panangsang of
Jipang in AJ. 1471 (1549) (Ricklefs, Mangéubumi, p. 75, n. 19). Kyai Sang
kelat, a Anis was a minor kraton pusaba earlier cattied by Mangkudiningrat 1
(SB 135 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. 1) LXX. 23, p. 286, and LXXVIII 13, p.
321). The sangétlar type of kris has'thirteen curves in the blade (Bink
and is traditionally the weapon which is hurled into the waves at Parang Tritis
to summon the goddess of the Southern Ocean (Ratu Kidul). Dipanagara
appears to have taken these pwsakar to to wash them ceremonially
(sram) as an act of worship to heighten his resolve. Afterwards they were
returned to the kraton (see Payen, 'Voyage', 6 Aug. and 21 Aug. 1825 who
described how Kyai Pléred and another pasake Aris were.given to Wiranagara
for safe keeping). During the war Dipanagara took with him three personal
pusahas: Kyai Satotama, a dagger (eandrik) which was worn by his wife, Ratu
Kédhaton; Kyai Barutuba, a pike, which was given to the commander of the
Bulkio regiment, and Kyai Abijaya, a kris which was worn by Dipanagara him-
self (LOr 6547 c, XXX. 73-4, p. 317 and see below a. 190). These were all
melted down in 1827 to make one éris, Kyai Agéng Bandayuda, which
Dipanagara was subsequently allowed to take with him into exile in 1830, but
which has since disappeared, see LOr 6547 c (Babad Dipanagera), XXX. 73-3,
p. 317 and AN BGG br, 30 Apr. 1830 no. L

1 122 i#r-ibbr was lumakn: the sending out of letters from Tegalreja is confirmed in
Dipanagara's babad and in the Buks (LOr 6547. by XXI. 34-41, pp. 346-8;
 KITLV Or. 13 IX. 6-9, pp. 88-9, IX. 34, p. 94; X. 9-16, pp. 105-7).
According to Dipanagara's account, his abdi-dalém, Wiryadikrama, was pressed
w by Dipanagara's followers for letters of authority (Piagém). Even followers from
| far afield on the north coast and the mancenagare areas begged for such letters.
When the request was passed on to Dipanagara, he replied that he could not
draw up the letters because his seal was with Mangkubumi. Wiryadikrama then
fetched the seal from Mangkubumi, who gave it up on condition that it was
returned as soon as possible for it was used to seal state papers in Yogya. Let
ters were then sent out to all Dipanagara's army commanders as declarations of
batdle (fondba dadining jurit). The Buku adds the detail that Dipanagara urged
the local commanders to gather together the village people and announced his
intention of waging a Holy War (prang sebil) with himself as the Imam(head)
of religion in Java, KITLV Or. 13, IX (Durma) p. 89:

Historical Notes & Commentary

Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1823). The earliest extant copies date
from the time Dipanagara and Mangkubumi were at Sélarong (dK no. 182,
Dipanagara and Mangkubumi to the chiefs of Kédhu, 5 Bésar, A.J. 1752, (24
Jul. 1823), and dK no. 132, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to Tumnéenggung
Jayamustapa, n.d., see above n. 36). Dipanagara's seal at this time bore his
name: 'B.P.H. Dipanagara', but it was lost in the flight from Té&galréja and later
a new seal was struck in pegon script with the title: Ingkang jumining Kangjeng
Sultan Ngabdul Khamid Erucakra Kabirul Mukminin Sayidin Panatagama ...
rasullahi s.a.w. ing tanah Jaw? (Makasat MS. Book II, pp. 2-3; dK no. 208,

Dipanagara to Maj. HF. Buschkens & Col. J.B. Cleerens, 17 Saban, A.H.
1245 (14 Feb. 1830).

Mértawijaya ing Bindba: Mértawijaya is referred to as R.Ng. Wiryawijaya in a
Dutch report and he is mentioned by this name later in the babad (see below
X. 19 and n. 202). Together with his brother, RT. Sumadiria, he joined
Dipanagara early in the war. They were both sons of the district head of
Kradenan in S. Kedhu, RT. Jayaningrat, who had been stripped of his position
as Bupati of Rémame probably at the time of the British annexation in 1812.
The latter was also the father of RT. Sumadiningrat, HB 11's xenophobic army
commander who was killed by the Britishin 1812 at the time of the storming
of the Yogya court, see KITLY H.76 pt. 2, List of names of Yogya officials
who followed DN; and KITLV H 97, p. 7, W.H. van Isseldijk, 'Korte Schets'
(1798). Mertawijaya took part in the revolt of Dipanagara's great-uncle,
Dipasana, in southern Kéedhu in Jan.-Feb. 1822 (see Carey, 'Origins', p. 65)
and was mentioned then as the BZkA of the dese of Béndha and the only local
leader who had not been caught (MVK 2874 BGG ir 0. 12, 19 Mar. 1822).
His zeal could be partly explained by his brother's death and his father's loss of
position. Dipanagara also referred to him in his babad and described his death
in the fighting around Gérajen (Kulon Praga) in Feb. 1826 (LOr 6547 c,
XXIV. 160-7, pp. 65-67 and see Smissaert's remarks on DN's relations with
Mérrawijaya in vAE 28, Smissaert to King William 1, Sept. 1828.).

Bendha is a village in southern Kédhu (Prabalingga district) on a small side
road leading from Blabag to Barabadur (see Louw, vol. III, Map 1), which was
renowned as a centre of oil. production (see Afdeeling Statis-
tick, De Residentie Kadoe, p. 120). It was also close to the important religious
school and mat weaving centre of 'Pésantren (see Raffles, HJ, vol. I, pp. 166-
7). Béendha was therefore in an area dominated by local Muslim traders who
were bitter rivals of the resident Chinese in Kédhu. The whole district of
Prabalingga was especially disturbed at the time of P. Dipasana's revolt (Jan.
1822) and again in July 1825 when the failure of the rice harvest caused prices
to rise from an average of £. 4 per pikul to f. 10 (dK 182, P. le Clercq to Van
der Capellen, 29 Jul. 1825). The fact that many of the local Javanese officials
appointed by the European government between 1812-1825 were foreigners
from the north coast (Semarang and Pekolangan) and not men from Kedhu
compounded the difficulties. At the same time, the presence of numerous
Chinese tax farmers who rented land from the ruler in the Yogya and Sala
enclaves in S. Kedhu (see below ns. 227-8, 231) and the uneven demands of
the land-tax (introduced by Raffles in 1812) aggravated local resentment
(Carey, 'Origins', pp. 65-7; Afdecling Statistieke, De Residentie Kadoe, p. 54, p.
78). The population of the district was c. 35,000 before the Java War and it
was won over for DN by secret messengers dispatched by the prince. 100 of
the Sultan's bodyguard who deserted to DN were also sent there to organise
resistance. Land-tax posts were burnt and by 27 July the men from Prabalingga

4 Ruden Papak ingkang rayilputra Mangkudiningratan: this refers to the son of

Mangkudiningrat 1 by an official wife (probably the daughter of R. Ayu
Serang), who bore the name R.M. Papak (later R. Mangkudiria/P. Natapraja).
His father was the son of HB II who shared the Sultan's exile first in Pulau
Pinang and then in Ambon where he died in Mar. 1824 (SB 136 (Babad
Neayogyakarta, vol. I1) XII. 10, p. 56). He left a numerous progeny, many of
whom joined Dipanagara. These included: R. Mangkuwijaya (later P. Mang-
kudiningrat 11) (41); R. Mangkudirja (R.M. Papak/P. Adipati Natapraja, see
below n. 215) (21); R. Martaarmaja (later P. Aria Suryamataram see below n.
217) (23); R. Sasraatmaja (later P. Aria Pakuningrat) (22), the commander of
Dipanagara's ferryboats during the war; P. Aria Pakuningprang (20); P. Aria
Papak (21); P. Aria Jayaningrat (19); P. Aria Mélayakusuma (17); P. Aria Cak-
raningrat (24) (the figures in brackets refer to the ages of Mangkudiningrat's
sons at the start of the war in 1825). All were born of unofficial wives except
R. Mangkudirja (R.M. Papak/Natapraja), see dK no. 111, 'Nominative Staat
van de Prinsen aan het Hof Djocjokarta', Nov.-Dec. 1829 and KITLV H 76,
pt. 2, List of Dipanagara's supporters, (1825). Papak had debts in Yogyakarta
amounting to Sp.D. 260 and had to pawn 1 jung of his land which may be one
of the reasons why he and his elder brother Mangkuwijaya, decided to go over
to Dipanagara. Both brothers also had grievances going back to the time of
their father's exile in 1812. According to De Kock (dK no. 111 'Over het
karakter van den Soesochoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta, en de prinsen
en rijksgrooten'), Mangkuwijaya and Papak had much influence in their lands
to the south of Yogyskarta and had many Twméngg#ngs under them (see
further Bat. Cour. no. 57, 30 Jun. 1827). On 2 Aug. 1825 they were already
organising support for Dipanagara at the village of Tajém on the road to
Klathen to the east of Yogya (Dj. Br. 54, Smisszert to-commander of Yogya
garrison, 2 Aug. 1825) and they-came to SElarong on. 6 Aug. to receive their
commands from Dipanagara (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 39, pp. 383-4, and see below
X. 33-4; Louw, vol. I, p. 362 n. 1, p. 342; vol. II, p. 422, pp. 541-58).

ing Gondbang Man Tuménggung Sutadirja: Gondhang, Sumbér
and Kalasan are all three villages close to each other to the east of Yogys.
Gondhang is slightly: to the north of the main Yogya-Sala road between Pram-
banan and Klathen (see below n. 130), Sumbér is on the Kali Opak slightly to
the south of Kalasan which is between Prambanan and Yogya on the main road
(Louw, vol. IH, Map 1). RT. Martalaya was a grandson of Pangeran Ngabehi
and was appointed as a Nayaka (Bupati jab) on 9 Nov. 1795 (Av], Van Jssel-
dijk to Van Overstraten, 9 Nov. 1795). He took part in the expedition against
Raden Rangga in Dec. 1810 (SB 135 XL. 5, p. 158), but later suffered serious
losses in landholding after 1812. He was mentioned by Smissaert as having
raised support for Dipanagara at the village of Katintang to the east of Yogya
on the road to Klathen early in Aug. 1825. after he had submitted to Dipanag-
ara at S¥larong (see further LOr 6547 b, XXII. 26, p. 310; dK no. 158 'Naam-
lijsten van Djokjosche hoofden'). RT. Dipadiria and R. Ng. Sutadirja were
sons of R. Ria the erstwhile Yogya Nayak (Bupati fere) and formed
part of the Yogya Péngain's following (KITLV H 76, pt. 2). They rallied to
Dipanagara at Sélarong on 6 Aug. with their father and were later dispatched
with Martalaya to carry the rebellion to Pajang (SB 136 LVI. 13, p. 250; LOr
6547 b, XXII. 27 pp. 380-1 and XXII 51, p. 386).

dbibis Kyai Suranagara was from the village of Karongan to the east of Yogya
just over the Kali Opak, and Suraréja (Sutaréja) was from Randbugunting just
by Prambanan on the Yogya side of the Opak (SB 136 (Babad Ngayomahkerta,
vol. I1) LXVL 42, p. 304). They are both described in the Yogya babad as hav-
ing gone over to Dipanagara and the latter is mentioned as the Dimang of
Kalasan who took part in the capture of R.M. Suwangsa on 28 Jul. 1825 (dK
No. 183, 'Verslag van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825; LOr 6347 b,
XXII. 66, p. 390). Pangeran Suryancgara was a nephew of Dipanagara and son
of Dipanagara's younger brother P. Adinagara. He was appointed as a Pangeran
at Sélarong and was given command of forces to the east of Yogysa with
Suranagara as his guardian @mben) (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 49, p. 386). Mudal
cannot be traced but there is a village by that name mentioned in the Pajang
area in 1770 (see Dj. Br. 41, 'Notes on the Book of Kl&pu', 1 Oct. 1770).

the Lieutenant of the prajuri? kraton Bausasra, and a son-in-law of Dipanagara's
younger brother Adinagara. R.T. Sasra(wi}jaya was a son of the Yogya Bupati
R-T. Natadiwirya (NBS 133 (VIH), 'Staat der Prinsen met bekendstelling hun-
ner vaders en schoonvaders,-n.d. (21830), nos. 10 & 36). Pandhés may refer to
the village marked as Pants on the Sala Res,. map, which is 4 &ilometres due

(LOr 6547 b, XXII. 92, pp. 396-7). Mangkubumi joined Dipanagara at Tégal-
rBja on 20 July and Adinagara and Suryadipura fled to Sélarong on the night of

20-21 July (see Chevallier, 'Dag-Register, 21 Jul, 1825 and Payen, 'Voyage',

went out with Chevallier to visit the repairs which were being carried out on
various bridges on the Yogya-Klathen road. He met Danur&ja near Klathen,
probably at the Kali Gondhang bridge (see further Chevallier, 'Dag-Register',

Historical Notes & Commentary

Dutch officials at this time was that the broken bottles were used for defensive
works in the avenues of Yogys (see Payen, 'Voyage', 11 Aug. 1823)!

pare Nayaka samy: in his diary Chevallier mentioned that all the Yogya
Tuminggungs had gathered in the morning at the kfpatiban and that later
Danuréja went to report to the Residency as the head of the Bupatis in Yogya
('Dag-Register', 18 Jul. 1825). The Nayakas here refer not to the 8 Wedanas of
the Sultan (see above n.6) but to the various Dutch officials in Yogya and those
Javanese most closely associated with them.

upas kantor kakalih ingkang dinuta: in his diary Chevallier referred to a letter
sent by Danuréja which was taken by messengers (@ Maceman) from the
kipatiban (Dag-Register, 18 Jul. 1825), and according to Dipanagara he
received a letter from Danuréja which he returned unopened (LOr 6547 b,
XXI. 46, p. 349). Smissaert, however, in another letter to Dipanagara the same
day, referred to Danuréja's letter and Dipanagara's reply, in which the latter
stated his fears that the Dutch and the Patih were planning moves against him
(MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert' no. 3, Smissaert to Dipanagara, 18 Jul. 1823).
Smissaert's letter was received by Dipanagara through Mangkubumi's Patih,
Sastradiméja (see above n. 35) on 19 July. Dipanagara replied to this the same
evening in a non-committal fashion. The following day he wrote again to Smis-
saert refusing to come to the Residency. because he feared arrest, He also
demanded that Danurja should be dismissed (MyK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert',
nos. 4-7, 19-20 Jul. 1825; vAE no. 28, Smissaert to King William I, ? Sept.
1828). Correspondence between Dipanagara and Smissaert can also be found in
Yogya kraton MS. A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran) p. 134 and pp. 137-8, but both
these sources contain recensions which are very far from the originals (on this
episode see further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 393-4 and Hageman,
Geschiedenis, pi 66).

manghat Pangeran Mangkubumilmring: Tégalrija: Smissaett's impolitic handling
of Mangkubumi and his decision to make him responsible for Dipanagara's
actions was the main-reason Mangkubumi-decided to stay at during
his second mission .on 20 July 1825. According to the latter he feared the
anger of the Resident (LOr 2168 no. 11, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De
Kock, n.d., p. 6, .... mila kula tumut Mlampabanipun Ki Arya Dipanigara amargi
saking dukanipun Tuwan Residben .....) and thus did not return. In another let-
ter, Mangkubumi stated that he had invited the Resident to go with him but
Smissaert had refused and did not even permit Sécadiningrat (Tan Jin Sing) to
accompany him. Despite his advanced age he had been forced to go to Tégal-
rja alone (see Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage LVI, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De
Kock, 9 Sura A.J. 1753 (23 Aug. 1825), pp. 727-9). Mangkubumi's account is
largely confirmed by Chevallier, whereas Payen, 'Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825, men-
tioned that Chevallier himself had offered to accompany Mangkubumi to
Tégalrtja but that the latter had persuaded Chevallier not to come because he
feared for the Secretary's life. Smissaert's action was later cited by De Kock as
one of the reasons for the Resident's dismissal in Sept. 1825 (dK no. XLV).

appears from this babad. He sent a joint letter with Dipanagara to Smissaert
the same day stating that he was afraid to meet him again because Dipanagara
could not be won over and both Dipanagara and himself only wished for
Danuréja's dismissal (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert'. no. 7. Mangkubui and
Dipanagara to Smissaert, 20 Jul. 1825). See further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype',

Council) and buiter read (out of Council). The Council is usually referred to as
the Red Pani or Reténi in the babads and it was an institution which fascinated
the Javanese because of its similarity with the Nayzkas and the system of
mupakat( consensus) which had to be achieved between the Wéanas in order
to approve royal décisions (see Ricklefs, Mangkubum. p. 396 n. 68).

5 nenggih konca kawnla BupatiMas Tuminggung Sindunagara lanlurdinas Wlandi

kanthine: this refers to RT. Sindunagara, oa Yogys Nayaka (Bupati jabs).
According to the other sources he was not accompanied by any Dutch officials,
but by Mas Aria Mandura, the Wedane gladhag (SB 136, XLVIII 52, p. 205);
Chevallier, 'Dagregister\, 20 Jul. 1825; MyK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 12,
Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see below XII 23). Accord-
ing to Dipanagara during the day (20 July) various messengers had arrived from
Yogya: first a Dutch orderly from the Residency (@rdénas saking Loj), then a
messenger from the Ratu Agéng in the kraton named Kyai Sutanata, and finally
RT. Sindunagara and Mas Aria Mandura (LOr, 6547 b, XXI 92-114, pp.
360-5). It is possible, therefore, that the account given here in the babad has
confused the visits. In his babad, Dipanagara described how the first two mes-
sengers were sent away. The latter, however, carried a letter from Smissaert
inviting Dipanagara yet again to come to the Residency in order to clarify a
'difficult case of state law" and informing him that a carriage would be sent to
fetch him (Yogya kraton MS. A. 62, p. 135, Smissaert to Dipanagara, 20 Jul.
1825, .... wonten prakawis rumpil sanget bab adil khukhuming negara, ewet pam-
bingkasipun, punika saudara' kula aturt 'rawah ing Loji .... saha kula aturi
péthukan karéta sarénga pun Tumenggung Sindunagara (lan) pun Tumenggung
Riva Mé(n)dura.) Dipanagara thereupon, invited this younger brother, Raden
Rangga, to read him the-letier but on hearing it he reiterated his refusal to go
to the Residency, exclaiming that he was not a child to be threatened (LOr
6547 b, XXI. 110 ...an dudu bocabipan arip denapusi. Compare this with the
passage below in this babad, VII. 24 ../... dbek yen gawe
parentabl...). Sindunagara asked him to put his reply in writing, a request which
Dipanagara initially refused, but then complied with after Mangkubumi had
prevailed on him just to reiterate his demand that Danuréja should be dismiss
ed (LOr 6547 b, XXI 113, p. 365). This was a significant development which
could have been the basis for further negotiations. The Bw&z even mentions that
Dipanagara was willing to meet Smissaert (KITLV Or. 13, IX. 63, p. 98), but
hardly had his scribe written five lines of the reply than there was the sound of
firing outside. Unbeknown to Sindunagara and Mandura their mission had been
followed up almost immediately by a military expedition which just at that
moment came into contact with Dipanagara's men (see below ns. 176 & 185).
Sindunagara and Mandura begged leave to depart. Thus ended the last attempt
to bring Dipanagara over (see further Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage LVI, pp. 727-9,
Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, 9 Sura A.J. 1753 (23 Aug. 1825);
Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 397-9; Hageman, Geschiedenis, p. 71 and

Historical Notes & Commentary

 

/Pangran Suryadipurane: Mangkubumi
visited Dipanagara alone on 20 July. His two relations joined the princes at
S&larong on 21 July (see above as. 129 & 141). In the account given in
Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 58-68, pp. 352-4), Dipanagara
described how he met Mangkubumi in the pendbapa at Tegalr&ja at 8 a.m. (see
above n. 114) and was asked once again to go to the Residency. The prince
replied that it was no longer for him to decide because he had become the
property of those gathered at Tégalréja (XXI. 62, p. 353, sampun dados meliki-
pun tiyang kathabidatan tuna pribadil...) and told Mangkubumi to ask them
whether they would allow him to go to the Residency. This Mangkubumi did
and was met by unanimous refusal from Dipanagara's followers, who pledged
themselves to fight. Mangkubumi then related that he could not go back to the
fort because he had been made responsible for Dipanagara's actions. He
described his meeting with Smissaert (see above n. 134) and at last decided to
go over to his nephew. At the same time, he gave orders to his Patih, Sas-
tradiméja, to bring over his wives and children (LOr 6547 b XXI. 92, p. 360;
Van der Kemp, "Hamlettype', p. 394, p. 404).

jaman awal Bragole Pathi: According to Babad Tanah Jawi texts, which were
probably the main source of the knowledge of these episodes in the Central
Javanese kratons in the- early nineteenth century, there were two rebellions by
Pathi (rama: Santénan), boch led by men called Adipati Pragola. The first was
against Senapari of Mataram (21574-1601) in 1600 and the second was against
Sultan Agung (1613-45) in 1627, which ended with the complete de'smxcrion
of Pathi (see Olthof (ed. and trans.), Babad Tenah Jawi, (Jay. version), pp.
110-2, pp. 129=31). The repetition of this event in the babads is one of the
pieces of evidence used by Prof. C.C. Berg to argue that the history of
Senapati is merely an antedated version of the history of Sultin Agung (see
C.C. Berg, "I'wee nieuwe Publicaties betreffende de Geschiedenis en Ges-
chiedschrijving van Mataram', Indonesi? vol. 8 (1953), pp. 97-128 and see
further Ricklefs, Modern Javanese Historical Tradition (London, 1978), p. 174).
There is some doubt, therefore, whether in VIL 15 fg .... mring
eyangiralKangjng Sultan Agungl..... actaally means Sultan Agung or 'the grand-
father of Sultan Agung) (i.e. Senapati). The history of Adipati Pragola and his
bravery was also enshrined in the lay of Prewaci/ra, the ballad of a beautiful
maiden captured in Pathi during 'Agung's expedition (see De Graaf, GI, p.
110). It is possible that the episode was also known through this source which
enjoyed widespread popularity in 'the. nineteenth century amongst Javanese
literati see Pigeaud, Literature of Java, vol. 1, p 258; on the historical back-
ground see De Graaf, 'Senapati', pp. 127-32; Id. 'Sukan Agung', pp. 135-43).

mungsuh Déler Panemuf. this refers to the revolt of Mangkubumi (HBI) against
Sunan Pakubuwana II (1727-49) and the Dutch in 1746-55. It originated
partly because of the decision of Governor-General G.W. van Imhoff (1743-
50) to support Pakubuwana II's Patih, Pringgalaya, in his argument that Mang-
kubumi should not be given control of Sokawati after the area had been prom-
ised to him as a reward for expelling the rebel R.M. Said (see Ricklefs, Mang-
kubumi, pp. 40-6). Mangkubumi's rebellion ended with the treaty of Giyanti
(13 Feb. 1755) by which he was recognised as an independent rulet in
Yogyakarta sharing half of Central and East Java with the Sunan. Later, other
independent principalities were carved out for the Mangkun¥garan (1757) and
Paku Alaman (1813). The oath referred to in VII 17 is the one which was
taken by Mangkubumi on 13 Feb. 1755 before the treaty of Giyanti was
signed. A copy of the Qwr'@n was held over Mangkubumi's head and he swore
that God and the Prophet Muhammad would curse him and his descendants if
they every broke the agreement. Later, just before his death, Mangkubumi
reminded his children that they should always remain loyal to the V.O.C.
(Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 72 and pp. 354-7). Ham&ngkubuwana II swore a

272

 

Babad Dipanagara

similar oath to the Dutch Company on his accession in 1792 (see Rothen-
buhler, 'Dagregister', p. 323). The example of the first Sultan was clearly an
important one for Dipanagara for he described his meeting with him when he
was still a child in arms (see LOr 6547 b, XIV, 45-6, pp. 114-5). Similarly, in
a letter written during the Jave War by his Path, Dipanagara stated that he
wanted the Europeans to recognise him and submit to his authority just as they
had done under the rule of his grandfather (sic) Sultan Hamengkubuwana I
(1749-92), (LOr 2168 no. 48, Pangeran Nir Adipati Ngabdulsalam Suryeng-
laga to Sch Ahmad Bin Ali Ketib, 10 Rabingulawal, Ehe, A.H. 1244, (19 Sept.
1828).

49 ninggih Mas Tuniénggung Sindupraja: this refers again to RT. Sindunagara (see
above n. 145): nager« and praja are interchangeable in Javanese, but the latter
is used here because of metr' came.

a

) ngapurancang astanira kalib; Sindunagara delivers his speech to Dipanagara
with his hands clasped in front of him as a sign of great humility and respect.
This stands in sharp contrast to Dipanagara's reply which is in ngoko (Low Javanese)
with many insulting expressions.

151 denngantiya fhleg kang margi: this refers to the period of the west monsoon in
Java (October-April) when country roads such as that leading to Tégalr¥ja
often turned to mud during the prolonged rains. It was then July at the height
of the dry season (east monsoon) (but see below n. 185). The expression is
used here to give force to Dipanagara's refusal -and to indicate that no matter
what lengths Smissaert went to, Dipanagara would still not oblige him by com-
ing to the Residency. 'This was not in fact Dipanagara's intention according to
other accounts (see above n. 145).

152 mring si buthak-ngelathak . this refers to Smissaert who was apparently bald.
Dipanagara's use of insulting expressions (es expressions les plus basses de la lan-
gue Javan{ais}e) to the Resident and Chevallier at a party in the Yogya fort
given by the Resident on 21 May 1825 for the Garéhlg Puasa was mentioned
by Payen ('Voyage', 18 Jul. 1825). At that time Dipanagara had spoken to the
Dutchmen in mgoke (low Javanese) and had called Smissaert 'the bald-headed
one' (see further Louw, 1, p. 47 n. 1; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 340-
41 and Van Pabst, 'Nota' (1826).

153 langhung karsa Kangring Tusan/.Imimiliba Welandi inghang denutus: this
episode is described ratherdifferently.by Chevallier in his diary in which he
made it clear that Smissaert had no intention of leading the expedition in per-
son, but rather showed himself as a coward in public (Dag-Register\, 22 Jul.
1825). His entry for 25 July described him as '..... timid and fearful, he had
completely lost his head and through his actions increased the confusion and
muddle from hour to hour ...' (Dag-Register', 25 Jul. 1825 and see above n.
141 concerning Mangkubumi's advice to Chevallier). Smissaert was greatly cen-
sured by contemporaries for not having gone personally to win over Dipana-
gara (vAE 28, 'Stukken betreffende het ontslag van A.H. Smissaert', Besluit van
den Minister van Marine en Kolonién, 13 Oct. 1829 no. 1; NvB Port. 9, pt. 3,
Nahuys van Burgst, 'Onlusten op Java). Willem van Hogendorp also castigated
the 'miserable attitude of Smissaert during the three days before (Dipanagara's)
rebellion' and commented that if Nahuys van Burgst had still been Resident,
'he would have written less and would have gone in his own carriage to fetch
'Dipanagara from Tégalréja' (H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp in
Nederlandsch-Indié, 1825-1830, pp. 147-8). Smissaert later excused his
behaviour by citing the example of the Resident of Bantén, P. du Puy, who
had been murdered in 1808 and whose death had been the signal for a general
attack on Europeans in the Residency (vAE 28, Smissaert to King William 1, ?

of 20 July Chevallier noted in his diary that Wiranagara had asked him for
some ball cartridges (scherpen patronen) for the Sultan's troops ('Dag-Register,
20 Jul. 1825). Sometime previously the Sultan's bodyguard had been re-
equipped at the request of Mangkubumi and Dipanagara with 200 English mus-
kets and bayonets and 100 sabres (MvK 2476, BGG br 7 April 1824 no. 20).
According to De Salis (MvK 4207, 'Pro Memorie}, 8 May 1828), Wiranagara
later supplied gunpowder'and lead to Dipanagara when he was at SElarong. It
seems, however, that only a few of the Sultan's troops took part in the expedi-
tion: Smissaert mentioned a mere 24 dragoons under a Dutch officer and a
few prajurits under Wiranagara (MK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert, no. 12 Smis-
saert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825. See further Kielstra, 'Een en Ander
omtrent Dipo Negoro', pp. 412-3).

because of his rank as witfana ibe prajurit rather than to his birth (see above

159 Kumpni slam catur-dési: this may refer to the squadron of 25 mounted troops

These had served in the kraton as a lifeguard for the Sultan since the intrigues
of the Sunan with the Sepoys in 1815 (NvB Port. 5, pt. 2, Nahuys van Burgst
to Van der Capellen, 11 Aug. 1816; AvJ Nahuys van Burgst to the Comman-
der of N.. Army, 25 Oct. 1819). Nahuys referred to these as 'Christian
troops' but the phrase Kumpén s/am' is often used quite loosely i in Javanese to

confirmed that Chevallier had been given overall command of the expedition in
his letter to Van der Capelien on 20 Jul. 1825. Chevallier had earlier had a
military career retiring from active service as Ist Lieutenant in Jun. 1822 to
become Secretary of Banten (see above n. 31). He is depicted wearing his hus-

sar uniform during the attack on Tégalréja in a coloured drawing in the Bukz
KITLV Or. 13, p. 99). Later both Smissaert and N. Engelhard blamed him
for overriding the advice of Thierry and being too precipitate in attacking DN's
dalim before it had been properly surrounded, see vAE no. 28, Smissaert to
King 4William I, an.d. (2 Sept. 1828) and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp.
101-4.

Mondrapratama: this refers to one of the Sultan's regiments which numbered
"0 men, (Dj. Br. 29, 'Statement of annual expenditure in the Cratton', 1 Dec.
1814) and which is mentioned as the Prawiratama in the Yogya babad (SB 136
L. 45, p. 218).

.... Brajataka: this may refer to the group of soldiers in the kraton who were
entrusted with the guarding of the third gateway leading to the northern
«lun named the Brajanala (GR, vol. 11, p. 678; Winter, 'Beknopte beschrijv-
ing\, p. 35). The regiment is mentioned in the Yogya babad as having taken
part in the first expedition against Sélarong (24 Jul. 1825) (SB 136, L. 45,
p. 218).

Surabraja aranipun: the episode of the desertion of a Lurah of the Sultan's pre-
jurits and his troops to Dipanagara at Tégalréja (see below VIII 24-43) is
confirmed in the other babad accounts except that the names used are some-
what different. All end with the death of the Luzab during the fighting against
the Dutch (see SB 136, XLIX. 34-9, pp. 208-9; LOr 6547 b, XXI 120-134,
pp. 367-70 and KITLV Or: 13, IX. 69-73, pp. 98-100). Smissaert also refer-
red to the fact that some of the kraton troops and their officers had refused to
take part in the expedition against and had gone over to Dipanagara (see
Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 404), Others went over in August (see Louw, vol.
I, p. 300).

rasukan sakélat abang/sabuk eindbe rineda sri: originally Jay. sakélat derived from
Ar. sakhia (lamb's wool cloth) (GR, vol. I, p. 895), but here almost certainly
refers to linen or cotton cloth which was dyed in three main colours (red,
green or black) at this time. Cindbe is the name of a flowered silk cloth woven
in Central Java out of the 80 chests of raw silk imported annually from China
(GR, vol. I, p. 247; dK 145 Waterloo 'Memorie' (1808).

denira arsa tinundbung/saking ing Tigaleja: see above ns. 34 & 92.

gagaman sampur malatar: see above n. 156. According to Dipanagara his men
were mostly armed with staves and slings, the latter being the most common. It
was not until he reached S&larong that he began to gather weapons (see De
Klerck, vol. V, p. 745; Payen, 'Voyage', 24 Jul. 1825 and on the use of arma-
ments and tactics during the war itself see De Stuers, Mémoires, pp. 4-10). At
the beginning of the war Kutha Gédhe was used as the main armaments centre
and shot and gunpowder were manufactured there (LOr 6547 c (Babad
Dipanagara), XXIX. 42, p. 276; NvB Port. 12, pt. 8, 'Verklating van Raden
Mas Machmoed, een gevangen muiter', 1 Aug. 1829). Gunpowder was also
purchased from other areas, presumably from the north coast where there was
a thriving local armaments industry (Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 296) and from
Banyuwangi, where sulphur for the manufacture of gunpowder was produced
on the Ijén plateau (IOL Mack. Pr. 14, Mackenzie, 'Report, p. 253; Raffles
HJ, vol. 1, p. 180). JayamEnggala, the Déewang of Samen (see above n. 36) was
especially renowned amongst Dipanagara's followers as an expert in gunpowder
manufacture (NvB Port. 12, pt. 8, 'Verklaring, 1 Aug. 1829 and Louw, 1, p.
207). The Dutch government also suspected erroneously that Dipanagara had
acquired gunpowder from Sumbawa and Lombok (see Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 32)
and there were rumours that an English or American smuggling brig had sup-
plied Dipanagara with arms at the mouth of the Praga river, see Anon. 'Journal

Aug. 1828. During DN's campaign around Surakarta in 1826 gunpowder was
smuggled to him from S&marang in dried fish and later it was manufactured in
a desa in Bagélen see Louw, vol. III p. 61 & p. 103. On the casting of iron and

kerig tan ana kang kantun/dalah pangindbungira; see above n. 133. krig refers
to the able-bodied men of a district or a village (GR. vol. I, p. 441) and here
includes the men from the villages surrounding Tégalréja as well as the Megér-
sari and Kepidhak (see above ns. 45 & 47). The pangindbung refer to the
share-croppers (orang ménumpang) who helped out for harvest work in the
neighbourhood (GR. vol. 1, p. 35). Later, Dipanagara reckoned that in all there
were about 1,000-1,500 people with him at Tégalr&ja during the Dutch attack

mostly armed with slings and staves (De Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI, p.
745; Louw, vol. 1, pp. 256-7).

..... sadaya samya see above n. 75. The use of jimats (charms and
amulets) in order to-give invulnerability 'was certainly widespread amongst
Dipanagara's followers. Jimats of wood and strips of paper with Arabic and
pegon characters were apparently distributed before battle (see Aukes, Legiven,
p. 74). Many of the banners carried by DN's-troops were regarded as being
magically powerful-and were decorated with crescent moons, snakes and sen-
tences from the Qur'@n (Booms, Eenige bladzijden, p. 34 and Jav. Cour. no. 123,
20 Oct. 1829), DN's own battle banner was green with a black disc in the
centre (see Louw, vol. II, p. 283 who described it during the storming of
Plered in Jun. 1826). The copy of a Zagreb text owned by Kyai Mélangi also
contains rajzb (sacred formulae) at the back (this is now in the Kamar
Dipanagara, Karesidenan Lama, Magelang). Later in the war, Kyai Banjarsari
from Madiun begged Dipanagara for 'a jimet of his blood' in the shape of his
own sister, R. Ayu Sasradiwiria, to reinforce their family ties with him (dK no.
124, R. Ayu Banjarsari and Kyai Banjarsari to Sultan Seh Ngabdulkamit, 11
Sapar, Jimakir, AJ 1734 (7 Sept. 1826) and see Louw, vol. II, p. 568).
Dipanagara was himself believed by his followers to be endowed with special
powers: thus Smissaert related reports that people believed the prince could
fly, make it rain or 'be dry (Dj: Br. 54, Smissaertito MacGillayry, 29 Jul. 1825)
and at the battle of Gowok (15 Oct. 1826) he was used as a shield by one of
his relations (LOr 6547 c, XXVIII 40, p. 236). Dipanagara was wounded in the
left thigh and above the right chest in the same battle (LOr 6547 c. XXVIIL
53-4, pp. 240-1; Bat. Cour., no. 49, 8 Nov. 1826 MyK 4192, Du Bus to
Minister of the Colonies, 6 Nov. 1826), but according to Dipanagara's later
testimony these bullets sharrered on impact and left no scars on his body, a
proof of his invulnerability (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 151; vol. II, pp. 516-7; De
Klerck, vol. V, p. 745 and see further Payen, 'Voyage', 3 Sept. 1825 quoting a
letrer of Smissaert to Res. of Kédhu, n.d., in which he reported that DN's sup-
porters had the belief that Dutch gunpowder and lead would turn into water).

Pangeran Dipanigaralwus angrasuk busananing prang sabil: this refers to the
turban and jubsh (long Arabic tabard with wide sleeves) which DN usually
wore into battle. What purports to be DN's jub«h is now on display in the
Kamar Dipanagara (Dipanagara room) in the old Residency house at Magélang.
Smissaert confirmed that Dipanagara wore this during the fighting at
for he described him as being dressed in a very distinguished white Arabic
'priestly' garment and ringed by men armed with lances (MvK 4132, 'Bylage
Smissaert', no. 12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see also

276

Babad Dipanagara

'Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825; Louw, II, p. 553; III, p. 62 and below n. 187).

~ other occasions DN was described as being dressed like a 'priest with a
acker of black cloth and a black or green turban. He also sometimes wore a
cas (upper garment) of the same colour, (see Jar. Cour, no. 114, 29
1829 and Louw, vol. I, p. 487; vol. II, p. 384). At the battle of Gowok
15 Oct. 1826), when he was wounded, DN covered his distinctive green turban
with his handkerchief in order to disguise his plight from his troops (see Louw,
wol. II, p. $19). Although Sultan Aguog (1613-45) also used to wear a turban
> battle (De Graef, 'Sultan Agung', p. 138), the normal Javanese courtly bat-
se dress (Prajuritan) was very different (see GR, vol. II, p. 241; RafMes, HJ,
vol. I, p. 90 and Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 60). It is unlikely that Dipanagara
carried three rises, the normal number for the prajuritan was two, one tucked
o the belt and one hanging on a belt. Thus, in a Dutch account, Yogya
sobles were described as going about armed with two &r/ses as a sign of their
warlike intentions just before the Java War, and Mangkubumi reported at
about the same time that Dipanagara was wearing his favourite Aris (? Kyai
Abijaya, see ns. 121 and 190) which he seldom carried. He also described how
Dipanagara from time to time held it in his hand in a threatening manner (see
Van Nes, 'Verhandeling' p. 156, p. 158).

W segeng para garwa-putral.....\maban samyd rid Silarong jinujug: according to
Chevallier ('Dag-Register', 19 Jul.1825), Payen (Voyage', 19 Jul. 1825), and
the Buku (KITLV Or. 13, IX. 48-51, pp. 95-6), Dipanagara sent his wives and
children away from Tégalréja with valuables to pay for his troops to Sélarong
on 18 July. Dipandgara's account (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 100-7, pp. 362-3), how-
ever, confirms the description given in this babad that the wives, children and
old men were sent away from Tégalrtja to go to Sélaroag just before the
Dutch expedition arrived there on 20 July. According to Dipanagara, Sindu-
magara and Mandura arrived very shortly after this had happened (LOr 6547
b, XXI. 108 p. 364 .../rong panginang watawis/.... in the space of time it took
to chew two mouthfuls of snib later). For a list of Dipanagara's family at this
time see R.Tanojo, Sadjtrah Pangéran Dipanagara Darah Mudura (Surabaja:

War.

172 pun Mitragna wastanipun: Mitragna is taken from Ske. Amétraghna 'the killer of
enemies'. The horses which Dipanagara mentioned in his own babad were call-
ed Kyai Githayu, a large black horse with white fetlocks (LOr 6547 b, XXL
127-8, pp. 368-9), Kysi Girismun (LOr 6547 c, XXIHIL 223, p. 34) and Kyai
Wijaya Tapa, a large bay horse, (LOr 6547, ¢, XXV. 40; Louw, II, p. 385).
According to Payen ('Voyage!, 21 Jul. 1825), Dipanagara rode a fine black horse
(? Kyai Githayu) during his flight from Tégalréja. It was superbly harnessed
and the reins were attached to Dipanagara's belt perhaps to leave both his hands
free for fighting (see also n. 187 below).

173 mapan kuning padbang bulan song-songipun: there is a picture of Dipanagara
with this payzng (state umbrella) being held over him in the Buk (KITLV Or.
13, p. 99a). In fact as the son of an unofficial wife (sr) Dipanagara would only
have been entitled to a white paying with gold bands. A yellow payung with
gold bands was reserved to sons of the Sultan by official wives (gara padm?)
(see KITLV H 139, 'Namen en Eer Tituls; Louw, vol. I, p. 498, n. 1). It is
interesting that the babad writer apparently found no difficulty in reconciling
santri and satria values by depicting Dipanagara in the raiments of the Holy
War (see above n. 169) but with the trappings of kraton office (the paywng),

thus providing an intriguing example of Javanese syncretism (see further Cares
'Cultural Ecology', pp. 50-1 and the Introduction pt. IV).

kaye putra Dwarawati: this refers to Samba, the son of Prabu Krésna in the

wayang, whose kraton was at Dwarawati (GR, vol. I, p. 587, and see above
n. 88).

,,,,, Dewadénta: from the Skt. Devadatta 'the gift of the gods'. The markings
seem to refer to Kyai Githayu (see above n. 172). It is worth noting that in
some accounts of the Re/w Adil, the latter is supposed to make his appearance
on a horse with similar markings (@rongge jamus) (Interview with R.W. Hard-
janta Pradjapangarsa, Surakarta, 6 Mar. 1972).

winatara satengab pal In his letter to Van der Capellen on 20 Jul,
Smissaert described how the expedition against Tégalrgja halted 70-80 rood»
(700-800 metres) outside the boundary of Dipanagara's dalém, A Javanese,
Mas Nitirantia, was then sent ahead to assure the people at Tégalr&ja that the
force had no hostile intentions and that if Dipanagara and Mangkubumi came
out unarmed, Chevallier would be prepared to negotiate with them. Instead
Nitirantia was mishandled and people poured out of the surrounding villages
firing shots and throwing stones (M¥K 'Bylage Smissaert' no. 12, Smissaert to
Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see Van-der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 402).

nudingit it is a very considerable breach of Javanese eti-
querte to point with one's finger and it is never done at another person. The
babad writer undoubtedly inserted the gesture here to stress Wiranagara's
anger.

178 dumeh bebet Surapati; this refers to Wiranagara's: relationship through his

mother to the famous Balinese adventurer of the late seventeenth century,
Untung Surapati (see SB 144, LXI. 22-6, p. 367; and De Klerck, vol. VI, p.
250 which discuss his ancestry). Surapati was especially renowned for his des-
truction of the Dutch garrison at Kartasura (1686). He later set up a personal
kraton in the neighbourhood of Pasuruhan and ruled as an independent prince
with the title of Pangeran Aria Wiranagara. Hisvinfluence stretched over much
of East Java by the time of his death in 1706 and he had a numerous progeny
whom he warned never tomake their peace with the Dutch, see Ann Kumar,
Surapaii, Man and Legend (Leiden, 1976), p. 99, p. 387 and passim. Wirana-
gara's ancestry related tum to Patib Danurgja AV, who was likewise of Balinese
descent from Surapati, and he also possessed a Aris, Kyai Gadhung, which was
once a pusaka of Surapati. Although he was married to a daughter of Pangeran
Abubakar, who was one of the first Yogya princes to go over to Dipanagara
together with Wiranagara's son (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 405),
Wiranagara himself remained loyal to the Dutch throughout the Java War.
Nevertheless, his allegiance was called into question by De Salis (see above n.
156) and he received various letters urging him to join Dipanagara at Sélarong
(Chevallier, 'Dag-Register', 26 Jul. 1825; KITLV H 699, nos. 26 & 28, P.
Suryengalaga to Major Turnénggung Wiranagara, Jul. 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 16
Sept. 1825 and Louw, vol. 1, p. 285; p. 403). He was appointed as an indepen-
dent prince with the title of P. Adipati Prabuningrat after the war, but was
exiled to Banda for suspected intrigues against the Dutch government on 5
Aug. 1832, when his relationship with Surapati was used as evidence against
him (see Sartono Kartodirdjo (ed.), Laporan Politik tahun 1837, (Diakarta,
1971), p. 57, n. 16; AN BGG, 20 Sept. 1832 no. 1, and SB 144, LXI 1-28,
pp. 364-7). The remark made here in this babad serves to underline the very
real tensions in the Yogya kraton at this time between the clique around
Danurja who profited from their associations with the Dutch and the officials
who joined Dipanagara (see above n. 119 and below n. 180).

278

Babad Dipanagara

 
   
 
  

ati Jaw vcl this refers to the Outer Bupati, RT. Ranadiningrat, ear-
mmander of the Wirabraja and Jagakarya regiments (SB 135, LXXX-
1. p. 336). A second expedition against Tégalreja is not mentioned in the
: sources and it is possible that the babad writer confused it with the
on sent against S&larong on 24 July, which went as far as Bantul and on
which Surakarta troops (a detachment of the Mangkun@garan Legion) took part
Chevallier, 'Dag-Register, 24 Jul. 1825 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 259).
Ranadiningrat was not wounded in the fighting at Tégalr¥ja see below IX. 28,
Bur in a small skirmish in Yogya on 5 Aug. (Dag-Register', 5 Aug. 1825; SB
136, L. 25-6, p. 215 and see Introduction pt. I1). The babad writer may have
about the skirmish and Ranadiningrat's wound from the Surakarta troops
who served in Yogya at this time.

WKD busy Sang Arya Sangkuni: this refers to Patih Aria Sangkuni, the devious
éviser of the Kurawa faction in the Mababbarate cycle of wayang kulit plays.
This forms part of the wayeng pure or 'original" wayang plays, which dramar-
ime episodes in the lives of Java's oldest mythological figures, especially the
Reroes of the final cycle, the five Pandhawa brothers (Brandon, On Thrones of
Gald, p. 2). Sangkuni is renowned as a clever talker but not an honest man, and
2 person of this character has always -been proverbially called a 'Sangkuni' in
Java (Hardjowirogo, Sedjarah Wajang Purwa, pp. 202-3). It would, indeed,
Rave been an apt description for Wiranagara who played a double game with
the Dutch, despising them at the same time as.using them for self-advancement

see further De Klerck, vol..VI, pp. 247-52). It is also interesting to note how *
far images from the wayang theatre are important as illustrations in this babad,
which reflects on the great contemporary interest in wayang forms at the
Surakarta court at the time (see Carey, 'Cultural Ecology®, pp. 7-11; pp. 47-
$4; Hageman, Gercheidenis, p. 24; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving p. 41 and
the Introduction pt. IV),

81 mingger ngaler-ngilen Pakuncen jinujug: Pasar Kuncen is due west of the Yogya
kraton just over the Kali Winonga (see Louw, vol. 1, Map 3). There was a
direct road from Kuncen to Tompeyan, the village near Tégalréja (see above n.
42) and south to Sélarong (see SB 136, XXXVIIL 50-52, p. 161). If
Ranadiningrat and Wiranagara had _met-up with Chevallier, who was halted
before Tégalréja, they would have had. to. turn around S.E. to go to Kuncen,
unless the babad writer is here referring to the departure from Yogya. It is
possible that since this account was written by a Surakarta Aujangge, the author
was unfamiliar with the local geography around Yogya.

.... bindbe tinitir angungkung: the bindbe is a type of cymbal which is sounded
as a war alarm to gather people for battle (GR, vol. II, p. 654 and on the
sounding of é¥ndbes and drums in engagements with Dipanagara's troops see
Louw, vol. 111, p. 71).

183 prajurit jro patang tambur ..... this refers to the four brigades of the Sultan's
bodyguard each led by a drummer (@ambur) which deserted to Dipanagara with
Surabraja: the Jaga-upa, Mandrapratama, Katanggung and Brajataka (see above
VIL 10-11).

Historical Notes & Commentary

185 mariyéme pinasang: according to Smissaett, the affray which started after
Nitirantia's mission (see above n. 176) soon developed into a full scale battle
The Dutch troops deployed into the sewahs (ricéfelds) surrounding Téegalréja
in an attempt to encircle Dipanagara's residence. The ricefields were, however,
very muddy because of the constant rain, unusual at that time of the year, and
a cavalry charge which was made to secure the persons of Dipanagara and
Mangkubumi failed. Finally, the cavairy were withdrawn by Chevallier and the
two cannon fired at the village people which killed about 15-20 men. The
decision was then taken to return to Yogya (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no.
12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype',

pp. 402-3 and Payen, 'Voyage!, 17 Jul 1825; 20 Jul. 1825 who also men-
tioned the heavy rain).

1852 ingsun kon aprang sabilimamangun agamaling Kangfing Rasulullah: see above
n. 30.

186 médal pungkuran: this is confirmed by Dipanagara in his babad in which he
described how Mangkubumi and himself fled by a gateway in the western wall
of the daltm of Téegalr&ja. They were then able to break through the Dutch
lines by riding over the paths in the sewabs (LOr 6547 b, XXL 126, p. 369
and see MvK 4194, Mangkubumi to Paku Alam, n.d. and Van der Kemp,
'Hamletype', p. 332). This gateway in the western wall of Dipanagara's estate
was clearly visible when Brumund visited Tegalreja in the 1840's ('Bezock', pp.
192-3) and an opening in the old wall can still be seen today (1972).

187 gong maguru gongsa: this refers to the gongs in the Javanese orchestra, the game-
lan. Dipanagara in his babad used an almost similar metaphor to describe the
darting hooves of his horse Kyai Githayu (LOr 6347-b, XXL 137, p. 371
..... IGithaya sca nyivig 138. Langkung bigar mapan anglir tinabuban!.....) and
Payen (Voyage, 20 Jul. 1825) noted that during the flight from Tégalréja,
Dipanagara made his horse prance as though he was dancing on it (.. if fexaif
piaffer son cheval, les reins attaché & sa ceinture, It tandagua an milien de ces
officiers armls de lances). The description probably derives from the fact that the
gantlan was often played during jousting contests (Sénenan and Stroman) on the
alun-alun when the riders rode in time to the music (see Djajadiningrar,
Herinneringen, p. 11). On the use of gongs and gamilans to rally DN's forces in
battle, see Louw, vol. I, p. 549; vol. II, p. 528.

188 Pangeran sidya ing wnkiriSilarong .;. his! babad, Dipanagara related how
the decision to go to was only taken after he and Mangkubumi had
watched Téegalr&a burn (see below n. 198). They then crossed the Kali Baym
with the remainder of their followers and observed the evening prayer
(mabrib). Because of their fatigue they slept at SEmampir, a village to the north
of the road from Yogya to SEntolo (see De Klerck, vol. V, Map). The next day
they continued south to the Kali Soka where they met the women and children
who had been summoned from Sélarong. Eventually they moved to Sélarong
with them (LOr 6547 b, XXI 147 - XXII. 10, pp. 373-376). The Yogya
babad and the Bz&u in general confirm Dipanagara's account, but add the detail
that they went N.W. to Tangkilan where they arrived in the evening. They were
all very hungry so they plundered the stores and houses of the Chinese in Bulu
and Tangkilan and burnt them to the ground (this would fit with the anti-
Chinese sentiments aroused at the beginning of the war, see above n. 106, but
may be a detail added by a hostile witness). Afterwards they slept at Polaman
and went to Sélarong the following day (21 Jul. 1825) (SB 136, L. 1-3, pp. 211-2;
KITLV Or. 13, X. 1-4, p. 103), Danuréja's spy, Ng. Mértadiwirya, also corroborated
the story (see below n. 197).

Babad Dipanagara

ww aniha gtlare titib santosa; emprit nibe refers to a Javanese battle formation

&e) which means lit. 'small birds rising'. This is the formation when one or
picked men come forward first from the main body and fall on the enemy
»R. vol. 1, p. 169). In fact, apart from the attempt by the Dutch hussars to
ou Mangkubumi and Dipanagara off after their flight from Tégalréja (see
above n. 186), there is no mention in any other account that there was a con-
serted attempt to intercept Dipanagara's retreat to Selarong,

pidbang suduk wasiyat saking kang ramalKa(ng)eng Sultan ping katri: this was
probably Kyai Abijaya, a prsake éris which Dipanagara had inherited from his
Sacher (see above ns. 121 & 169) and which was later meked down with other
pusakas belonging to DN to make his kris Kyai Agéng Bandayuda. Knoerle
seferred to DN's &r/s as follows (Journal', p.31): . Dipanagara placed a
beautiful, expensive Aris in my hands (and) spoke the following words: "See
mere an heirloom of my father, who is now a friend of God, this éris is a
puszke (heirloom) of many years. When my father wished to give a token of
submission to the Marshal (Daendels) he gave this selfsame Aris into his hands.
Bur the Marshal gave it back for he knew it to be a holy pusake and that my
father was a true friend of the Dutch." Dipanagara also had in his possession a
sabre, possibly of English origin (2 from HB: I1}, which was captured by the
Dutch in 1829 and presented to De Kock (see dK 56, Col. J. Ledel to De
Kock, 28 Jun. 1829).

 

\ prapteng Winong(a): the tiverWinonga runs just-to the west of Yogya in a N-S

direction. At this time there was a ford across the river further to the south on

the road to Sanasewu opposite the kraton. This was probably Wiranagara's
objective (see Louw; vol. 1, Map 3).

wangbe sungsun atindbib: the numbers killed in the battle around Tégalr&ja are
rather uncertain. Smissaert mentioned that a Sergeant (wachrmeester) of the Sul-
tan's Dutch dragoon bodyguard, David (? an Ambonese), was killed in the
cavalry charge and three others of the same corps wounded by pikes (MyK
4132, 'Bylage Smissaett', no. 12, Smissaett to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825
and see also Payen, 'Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825 and above n. 1853). Dipanagara
specifically mentioned the death of one hussar (LOr 6547 b, XXI 143-3, pp.
373-3) and reckoned that 80 other Dutchmen were killed (Iid, XXII 2, p.
374), but his figures for battle losses were never very accurate. Dutch sources
state that about 15-20 of DN's forces perished, see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlet-
type', p. 403.

wonrtn Mayor Mondrapratama raniralRaden Jayapramadi: this seems to refer to
the eldest son of II (1799-1811) by an unofficial wife, Mas Ayu
Pulungayun. Together with his younger brother, R. Bagus Sukapja, he served
in the Yogya kraton as a panakawan from 1819, and, on the accession of HB
V (Dec. 1822) he became an abdi-daltm (Lurab Pranakan) with the title of
Raden Lurah Jayapérmadi (for full family details see LOr 11089 (1) 'Léelam-
pahanipoen Kangdjeng Pangeran Arja Djoeroe saking R.M.P. Santadilaga', Lem-
posjangan, (Djokjokarta) (1929). If he had served in the Sultan's bodyguard he
would probably have been a member of the Jaga-upa corps which was com-
posed of panakawans (see above n. 44). There is evidence that he did not go
over to Dipanagara until early in August 1825 when he left the kraton with his
younger brother and Raden Bagus Séntot, all three kraton panakawens and
close friends (see LOr 11089 (1) pp. 4-3; SB 136, LV 15, LVI. 3, pp. 242-9;
Dj. Br. 45, Smissaert to P. le Clercq (Res. of Kédhu), 6 Aug. 1825; Idem.,
Smissaert to De Kock, 9 Aug. 1825). Later all three became important army-
commanders of Dipanagara: Jayapérmadi as Basah Ngabdulkamil Mértanagara
(he was also a son-in-law of Dipanagara), Sukapja as Bash Ngadul Mahmud
Gandakusuma (see above the introduction pr. V.C) and $&ntot as Ali Basah

Historical Notes & Commentary

Abdul Mustapa Prawiradirja. The latter was related to Dipanagara by mem=»
(see LOr 6547 d, XXXII 21, p. 4). The babad writer has thus used Jays
madi's name in an incident in which he could not have taken part, although th«>
is a possibility that another Yogya officer is intended here (see BL Add. N

12303 £.100r which mentions a Lurab of the Nyutra regiment called Ngabe»
Jayapermadi in 1797).

tinumbak kinalban kananireki: see above n. 179. The Yogya babad mentiones
that Ranadiningrat was wounded in the left arm by a sling shot, see SB 13%

seems more likely that they arrived on the morning of 21 July at Sélarong. The

route they took was not the direct one to Bantul, but one across the back #
the limestone hills behind Sélarong (see Map A).

  

Ngambarkatawang ...... see above ns. 21 & 42. Ambarkatawang is on the road
which runs $.W. from Yogya to S&ntolo. The scouts would have had to tur
back to Kuncen to get on the road which led south to Pendhawi and Sélarong
(SB 136, XXXVIII 50-2, p. 161 and see above n. 181).

desa ing Bantul .....: Bantulis now akabupaten capital to the south of Yogys,
but it was then probably still a small village. A small side road leads west across
the sewabs from the outskirts of Bantul to S#larong (visit to Sélarong, Dec
1971; Louw, vol. I; Map 8, 'Situatie-Schets van Stlarong en Omstreken'). An
official of Danurja, Ngabehi Mérradiwirya from the village of KEmusuh to the
west of Yogya, possibly the upar (courier) referred to in this babad, reported
that Dipanagara and Mangkubumi had been seemvafter their flight from Téral-
reja. They had passed through the village of Ngraitk near Melangi and at 7
p.m. they had halted ar Gancahan a village to the west of Tangkilan (see above
n. 188). The following morning they arrived at the dese of Mutian (Kémbang
Putian/Stlarong) at 8 a.m. There, he described them, as gathering their follow-
ers and at the same time a residence was being prepared for them at Jél&gong.
just to the east of the Praga river in the house of the Mantri tua bury (head Pf
the tiger hunters) (MyK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 10, Report of Ng. Méer-
tadiwirya, ? 22 Jul, 1825 and on the apanage arcas of the tiger hun-
ters see BL Add. 12342, £.. his report to Van der Capellen on 20
July, Smissaert mentioned that Mangkubumi and Dipanagara were at the desa
of Sécang near the Sultan's of Toya Temumpang and on 29 July
he wrote that the-princes were forming a 'kraton' at Sélarong (Dj. Br. 54,
Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825). In his babad Dipanagara stated that he
stayed at the house of Kyai Dé&mang Arjabaya at Sélarong (see LOr 6547 b,
XXIL 13, p. 377, Louw, vol. 1, p. 262, p. 437 n. 3) and see below n. 208.

datan ana kang kari télas sadaya: the Dutch reports omit all mention of the
plundering of Tégalr&ja, but it is confirmed in the babads (SB 136, L. 1, p.
211; KITLV Or. 13, X. 2, p. 103). Dipanagara added the detail that it was
burnt to the ground (LOr 6547 b, XXL 147-8, p. 373). Most of Dipanagara's
possessions were carried off to Yogya by Danuréija's men including the prince's
large gamilan orchestra. Indeed, in a later conversation, Dipanagara remarked
that he had been forced to leave his Za/#» in such haste that 3,000 guilders in
ready money, and much pad? from the Puasa taxes of that year had been left
behind (Knoerle, 'Journal; p. 4; De Klerck, vol. V. Bijlage XXXVI, p. 743).
Some belongings and valuables had, however, been sent ahead with the women
and children to Sélarong (see above n. 170). The fact that Tegalréja was gutred
was corroborated later by Brumund ('Bezoek', p. 185 and see further Louw,
vol. 1, Bijlage LVI, p. 731, Mangkubumi & Dipanagara to De Kock, 23 Aug.
1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 332-3).

Babad Dipanagara

Sa nglir klantaka wrésacanthuka: there seems to be a mixed metaphor
bere: kalantake refers to a small cannon, about a half pounder, which was cast
by the Javanese themselves (GR, vol. I, p. 485; Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 296),
whereas wréacanthuka seems to suggest sasracanthukawarse: - 'a hubbub (lit.
the croaking of a thousand frogs in rain').

» Raden Tuminggung Danunagara: a Yogya Nayaka (Bupati jaba); like Sin-
dunagara, he was a relation of DanurEja II. Crawfurd described him as 'a man
f very little talent (NvB Port. 5, pt. 5, Crawfurd to Nahuys van Burgst, 9
Aug. 1816).

200 pre santana samys nanghil: on 21 July Chevallier noted in his diary (Dag-
Register) that the princes and Bupatis had come together to nominate a new
guardian for the Sultan. P. Adinagara was named, but he went over to
Dipanagara during the night with his younger brother P. Suryadipura (see
above ns. 113 & 129).

2300s Kungféng Pangran Pakwalamigumr¥dtg wadya kang iring: according to Mang-
kubumi's testimony Paku Alam's Legion had been mobilised as carly as the
morning of 20 July when he was summoned to the fort at 4 a.m. to take the
message to Dipanagara (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 89, p. 359; MyK 4194, GKA 13
Mar. 1827, Lite. 31, no. 34, Anon. to HB TI, n.d.; and see above n. 117).

201 pesliyun Surakarta Bétawi; Smissaett dispatched two let-
ters to Van der Capellen: the first on 19 July wating him of Dipanagara's pre-
parations and the second, on 20 July, relating the events of the attack on
Tégalréja (MvK 4132; 'Bylage SmissaerC, Smissaert to Van der Capelien, 19
Jul. & 20 Jul. 1825 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 383 n. 1, pp.
402-4). The latter was sent first to Surakarta to inform MacGillavry of events
in Yogya (NvB Port. 9, pt. 2, MacGillavey to Smissaert, 20 Jul. 1823) who
relayed it to Batavia via SEmarang where it was received by the Assistant-
Resident, J.A.R. Caspersz, on 22 July (see below n. 245). MacGillavry also
seems to have sent a covering letter relating how Dipanagara 'had been mobilis-
ing troops in a desa near Sala, but that the Surakarta court had so far remained
loyal and that detachments of the Sunan's Pra/w/ts and the Mangkunégaran
Legion had been 'sent to Yogya (Anon., 'Aanteckeningen van den
Gouverneur-General Baron van der Capellen over den Opstand van Dipo Ne-
goro in 1825, TNI, no. 2 (1860), pp. 363-4). Van der Capellen received the
letters on 24 July, im 'his description: 'completely unexpectedly' (op het aller
onverwachts), and on 26 July the decision was taken to send the Lieutenant
Governor, General H.M. de Kock, to Central Java with full military and
civilian powers (MvK 2789, BGG ir, 26 Jul. 1825, no. 1; Louw, vol. 1, p. 253).
The way the news is related as having been transmitted in this babad is there-

fore substantially correct except for a few minor details. The use of estafettes
(fast mounted couriers) at this time is mentioned in Van der Kemp, 'Brieven'

(1896), p. 542 and see also Jav. Cour. no. 138, 18 Nov. 1828.

 

202 wisma dbusun ing Bindba Wiryawijaya: see above n. 123. In his letter to the
king in Sept. 1828 (vAE no. 28) Smissaert mentioned that he was told by
Danurja on the morning of 20 July that Dipanagara stood in close contact
with Kramadiwirya from Kédhu and the inhabitants of the dese of Béadha. He
added that the latter were renowned for their rebellious spirit, and that when
DN's enterprise in Yogya proved successful they would fall on Maglang.

203 ing Dimak lan Stmarang/....Jing Rawa Kalangbret padha: SEmarang and Démak
were both government controlled kabupaten on the north coast which were the
scene of bitter fighting during the first months of the war (see Louw, vol. I, pp.
361-93 and pp. 527-36). Serang was a small enclave between Gagatan and

Historical Notes & Commentary

Grobogan, which was administered as a fief of the Serang family (see below =
205) (Dj. Br. 27, Map of Daendels' annexations in Jan. 1811). Magétan, K@-
tasana, Rawa and Kalangbret were all Yogya mancanagara provinces to the eas
of Mt. Lawu, Madiun was the seat of the Yogyakarta Bupati widana before the
Java War (see Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p. 589; NvB Port. 22, pr. 4 'Montie-
negorosche Djocjakartasche Landen', 1822; De Klerck, vol. VI, Map).

anjaganana Walondal.....kang tha ing Sémarang: Semarang and Surdbaya were
the military headquarters for the second and third military divisions (grow
militaire afdeelingen) in Java. About 1.468 troops were stationed at Sémarang
and S&rondol and another 930 at Surabaya. But the garrisons were not up to
strength because of the dispatch of troops from Java to take part in the Dutch
military expedition against the kingdom of Bone in South Sulawesi (Jan.-May
1825) (on this see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 553). Instead, the Dutch
had to rely on volunteer corps (schutzerif) recruited from government officials
and agents of commercial and shipping houses (see Louw, 1, p. 540 ff.; p. 584.
pp. 664-5; Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 554-9; Aukes, Legiven, p. 65)
On the summoning of reinforcements from Surabaya in the early months of the
war see Louw, vol. I, p. 278.

 

khang bawah lor si paman Pangeran Serang: Serang was not an uncle of Dipanag-
ara, but a relation by marriage: Serang's sister had married P. Mangkudiningrat
I (see above n. 124). He was about 31 years of age in 1825 and was held in
high esteem in Yogya as a descendant of Sunan Kalijaga. His mother, R. Ayu
Serang, was regarded as especially #&t (spiritually powerful) and during the
war she often meditated in a cave at Trisik on the south coast (KITLV H 263,
Portier, 'Verklaring', p. 14). She also served as a cavalry commander, taking
part in the fighting in Grobogan and Démak in Sept. 1825 (Dj. Br. 7, L.A.
582: Brieven 1825", Capt. HF. Buschkens to Maj-Gen. J. van Geen, 3 Sept.
1825 and for a recent literary biography, see Mashoed Haka, Danie Ny Ageng
Serang (Jakarta, 1976). The area of Serang had been given to Kalijaga and his
descendants, who took the titles of Reder and Pangeran even though many
worked as farmers and labourers (Louw, vol. 1, p. 361). De Kock later charac-
terised Serang as a thoroughly evil man, devoid of any principles and addicted
to opium (dK no. 111, 'Over het karakter van den Soesochoenan, den Sultan
van Djokjokarta en de prinsen en.rijksgrooten', 20 Dec. 1829). In his babad
Dipanagara confirmed the appointment of Serang as commander in the pesisir
whilst he was at Sélarong (LOr.6547 b, XXII 52, p. 387). He carried out a
very effective campaign in the north coast areas and in Sokawati, where he
wielded much influence in the first years of the war, but he later gave himself
up on 21 June 1827. According to Louw, vol. I, p. 362, Serang joined DN on
the repeated urgings of his nephew, P. Natapraja.

Kertadiria kang wawangi: Mas. 'T. Kértadiria was well known to Dipanagara
because his father had served as head of the éadiparer when Dipanagara's
father was still Crown Prince (see LOr 6547 b, XV. 39-41, pp. 141-2) and he
himself had been supported by Dipanagara after his unfair dismissal as Bupati
of K&rja (in the Karangpandhan area of Sokawati) in Dec. 1821. This dismissal
had been engineered by the Yogya Path, Danurdja IV, who appointed his
wife's uncle, RT. Sastawirana, to replace him (see SB 136 (Babad Ngayogya,
vol. II) XXXVII, 20-25, pp. 157-8). Mangkun@gara II had also pressed for
K&rtadirja's dismissal because he coveted the area which adjoined his
own lands in Karangpandhan. Kertadirja was thus a good example of a Bupati
dhonghol, one of the many prematurely dismissed Bupatis, who rallied to
Dipanagara at this time (see above n. 39). In his babad Dipanagara confirmed
that he gave K¥rtadirja his command in Sokawati at the same time as Serang
received his authority in the pasisir (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 52, p. 387). Both
Serang and Kértadirja were active around Madiun, but the latter was captured

$59, p. 576 and for a short biographical sketch see Dj. Br. 9B, 'Aankomende
Geheim stukken', H. MacGillavry (Res. Sala) co P. Merkus, 16 Feb. 1832).

20° Pangran Manghunigaral....!lan asagub ngrusak gunung Karangpandban: this
refers to K.G.P.A.A. Mangkunégara II (1796-1835) who was a good friend of
the Dutch and a proponent of estate management in Central Java. Karang-
pandhan, to the east of Sala in the foothills of Mr. Lawu, was, according to
Willem van Hogendorp, one of the best maintained teak forests in Java at that
time (H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp in Nederlandsch-Indit,
1825-1830, p. 167). The area also contained the graves of the Mangkunegaran
family at Girilayu and Méngad&g. It was overrun by Dipanagara's followers in
Aug. 1826. After the war the 500 keryas of Yogya land at Kerja in the
Sokawati area were given to the Mangkunégaran as a token of Dutch gratitude
for the help they had received from the court during the war (Rouffaer, 'Vors-
tenlanden', p. 603; MacGillavry to P. Merkus, 16 Feb. 1832, loc. cit.; A.P.
Bichler, 'Socrakarta véor 63 jaren', TNI (1888) vol. I1, p. 8).

208 itrat piagem pangwasa; a piag{m is a letter of appointment or authority. The
only original piagim of Dipanagara still extant is that appointing Amad-daftm
(keeper of the royal graves) Ripangi, Bupati of Kutha Gédhe in Mar. 1826
which is written in pegen script-with Dipanagara's pegon seal in the top right
hand corner (dK no. 127, Sultan Abdul Hamid Erucakra to Amad-dalém Ri-
fai (Ripangi), 16 Shaban, Wawu, A.H. 1241 (26 Mar. 1826). Some copies of
the pregéms sent out by Dipanagara and Mangkubumi at the beginning of the
war to their supporters are, however, still extant (see above n. 122), and the
distribution: of commands and pizgéms is confirmed by Dipanagara and the
Dutch reports (LOr 6547 b, XXII 39-58, pp. 383-8; Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to
commander of Klathen, 3 Aug. 1825, where he mentioned that DN was giving
out titles and paywngr at S&larong; dK no. 183, 'Verklating van Raden Mas
Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825, described how the princes and Bupatis were
lodged at the house of the Démeng (of Kémbang Putian), Kyai Démang
Arjabaya, with only 150-200 armed men as a guard and that bands of people
came daily from the surrounding areas and departed the same day after they
had received their orders, see further Louw, vol. I, p: 262, p. 400).

209 ginadbuban songsong jinat/pratandhanira prang sahil: see above n. 173. The dis-
tribution of Paynes (state umbrellas) was hot so much the sign of the Holy
War as a regalia of office. Hence in his babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII 39, p. 383),
Dipanagara described how yellow pay«ngs were distributed to Mangkuwijaya
and Mangkudiria after they had been promoted as Pangerans see below n.
215). R.M. Soewongso was also offered a white paywng if he agreed to join
Dipanagara (dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825)
and payengs were carried by commanders in battle: thus during the siege of
Magélang, the Resident of Kédhu noticed red and yellow paywags amongst the
troops besieging the town (dK no. 182, P. le Clercq to De Kock, 29 Jul. 1825)
and they were later carried by DNs troops fighting in Bagtlen (Bat. Corr. no.
107, 8 Nov. 1827). See Louw, vol. 1, p. 498 for a description of the payangs.

209 Jéng Pangeran nimbali Pangeran Serang/p¥parab Sumawijaya: The Dutch sources
do not confirm that Serang went in person to Sélarong to receive his commands
from P. Dipanagara. Instead he seems to have sent a kinsman, R. Topeng (R.
Wangsadiwirya), to receive them for him (see dK 180, HJ. Domis to Van der
Capellen, 23 Sept. 1825; 12. to I2., 25 Sept. 1825).

kabupaten on the north coast which were later brought into the war in 182"
during Tunénggung Sasradilaga's rebellion, see Louw, vol. III, chaps. VI-IX
Téras-Kéras is mentioned in a letter of P. Serang to Natapraja in Aug. 1825 as
a place which he would attack first before falling on D&mak (Yogya kraton MS
A. 62 (Bahad Dipanagaran), pp. 300-1). For a description of fighting in these
areas during the first year of the war see Louw, vol. 1, Chaps. XIV & XIX.

Prabalingga, about 5 kilometres $.W. of Muntilan (see IOR K. IX. 4, 'Topo-

,,,,, Tuminggung Samadigdaya: a certain R. Ng. Sumadigdays, a son of RT.
Sumadiningrat (killed 1812), is mentioned in the Dutch reports as a Trmeng-
gung from Yogya who joined Dipanagara (dK no. 158, 'Lyst der Personen
welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen', no. 76, and see further

KITLV H 76 p. 2). He was later appointed by DN as RT. Sumadiningrat II
(see Jar. Cour. no. 123, 14 Oct. 1828).

kang rama ngaturan Mangkubumi: Smissaett mentioned on
29 July that Mangkubumi,had been appointed a PanZwbabaz. But in his babad
Dipanagara described how Mangkubemi was given the new name and title of
Pan&mbahan Ngabdulraup only after he himself had been appointed as Sultan
on 15 Aug. 1825 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825; LOr
6547 c, XXII $2, pp. 8-9). Despite his high title Mangkubumi's: task
throughout the, war'was to look after the women. and children (dK no. 158,
'Lyst der Personet' no. 2). Dipanagara characterised him 'as a coward (ingkang
knwatos kemawon) (Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 15), and Brumund (Bezoek, p. 192)
aptly referred to him as Dipanagara's 'Great eunuch'. For a more generous
appraisal of Mangkubumi's character see De Salis (MyK 4207, 'Pro Memorie,

8 May 1828) who referred to him as 'a quiet, soft and gentle man'. On Mang-
kubumi's activicis during the war see further dK [11, 'Over het karakter van

377; Makasar MS. Book I1, p. 6 and see above n, 113). Smissaert reported that
he was given the title of Pangeran Adipari Anum Surya Ingalaga Sonopati neng
prang (the Commander in Battle) on 2 Aug. (Dj. Br. 94, Smissaert circular
letter to Residents in Java, 2 Aug. 1825 and see Payen, 'Voyage', 15 Aug.
1825). He was extremely active in raising forces for Dipanagara to the south of
Yogya around Krapyak in the early days of the war (dK no. 197, Smissaert to

De Kock, 30 Jul. 1825 and see further Louw, vol. 1, p. 262; p. 432 ff. and p.
434 n. 1).

 

Raden Mas Papak ginanjarl.....Raden Arya Mangkudiria: RM. Papak had
already been appointed as Raden Aria Mangkudirja in Yogya in 1814 (SB 135,
LXXXVI, 25, p. 349 and see above n. 124). According to Dipanagara, he
appointed Papak as P. Natapraja at Selarong and gave him the right to carry a
yellow paynng (LOr 6547 b, XXII 39, pp. 383-4).

Raden Suryakusuma wuslfinintngabin Pangran: Suryakusuma was a son of P.
Mangkubumi by an unofficial wife and his appointment as a Pangeran at
Sélarong is confirmed in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 42-3, pp.

286

Babad Dipanagara

dK no. 158 'Lyst der Personen' no. 21). He was sent to Bagélen with
Enggung R&ksapraja (see above n. 35) and Dipanagara's eldest son. They
joined there later by RT. Jayasundarga Prawirapraja, a son of Réksapraja,
became the army commander at L&ngis between the Jali and Bagawanta
s in East Bagélen (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 107-8, p. 57; Jayadiningrat, 'Schet-
sen p. 56; Yogya kraton MS. A. 62 (Babed Dipanagaran) p. 142 and Jaz. Cour.

den Manghnwilayal....\Pangran Suryamatawis: this seems to refer to the
elder brother of R.M. Papak, R. Marta-atmaja, born of an unofficial wife and
« about 23 in 1825, who was appointed as P. Suryamataram at Sélarong see
NBS 133 pr. VIII no. 35 'Nominative Staat van de Prinsen aan het hof van
Diocjokarta®; SB 136 LVL. 19 pp. 250-1 and see above n. 124.

    

  

 

208 sealih nama Esch Neabdulchamid: the babad. writer's
count of the names given to the rebel leaders seems to have been based on
the rather garbled reports reaching Yogya at this time. Thus on 13 Aug. Smis-
saert reported that Dipanagara was styling himself as 'Pangeran Panatagama' or

- Susubunan Ingalaga Panatagama' (dK no. 181, Smissaert to De Kock, 13 Aug.
1825; dK. no. 180, Domis to Alg. Seer, 26 Jul. 1825). it was not until 15 Aug.
1825 (1 Sura, Wewr, AJ. 1753) that Dipanagara took his full title of Sulten
Nasbdulkamid Erucakra (the 'Just King!), Kabirul Mukminin (the First among the
Believers), Sayidin (Lord of the Faith), Pamatagama Jawa (Regulator of the relig-
ion in Java). Kelifat Rasulallah (Caliph of the Prophet of God) (LOr 6547 c,
XXI 40-41, p; 73 Louw, vol. I, p. 439; and see Ricklefs; 'Inspirational Experi-
ence', pp. 244-5; the order and content of the titles varied). For the origin and
significance of the name Ngabdul Kamid see Ricklefs, pp. 241-5. The full titles
were apparently first divulged to Dipanagara in his vision of the eight wali
wudhars on 27 Pusa, A.J. 1752, (16 May 1825) see LOr 6547-6, XX. 51-7, pp.
527-9. The fact that the babad writer did not know of Dipanagara's full title and
the use of the name Erzeakre is probably because this fragment was completed
before 15 Aug. 1825. See further Louw, vol. 11, p. 569 who quoted a letter of °
Van Pabst to De Kock-(3 Nov. 1826) stating that DN was recognised as Sultan
I in all the Yogyakarta maxeanagare provinces which rebelled in 1825.

2i8a len Kyai Taptajaniinama Pansmbahan JuruiPandbita Sabilullah: see above n.
100. There is no mention in any of the other Javanese or Dutch accounts that
Taptajani took this dtle, but the babad could'pethaps be accurate here in view
of Taptajani's close connections with the Surakarta court.

\ 219 Pangeran Adiwinata/Pangran Adikusumekiltitindbib prang loring kitha; on
Adiwinata see above n. 113. In his babad Dipanagara described how Adiwinata
was given a command in K&dhu under the guardianship of Kyai T. Mangundi-
pura, an ex-Bupati wdana of Kedhu, (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 44, p. 385; SB 136,
LH. 22, p. 228). Adikusuma was a son of HB I and in all other accounts he is
mentioned as having remained loyal to the Dutch (see dK 158, 'Naamlijst der

Djokjosche hoofden, die aan het Nederlandsch gezag getrouw zijn gebleven',
Mar.-Dec. 1829).

220 Suryengalaga tindhibiprang sabil kidul ka(dba)tun; this was confirmed by Smis-
saert's letter, see above n. 214.

221 supayane jro praja leranga pangan: Dipanagara's strategy of attempting to starve
Yogya into surrender during the first months of the war is confirmed in the
other Javanese and Dutch sources. It formed part of his plan to destroy the
Yogya kraton and set up a new undefiled kraton at another site (see Baud no.
177, W. van Hogendorp, 'Rapport omtrent Kadoe' (1827), and above ns. 29 &

because small traders were prevented from coming to sell their wares there
KITLV Or. 13 XII (Asmaradana) p. 124:

sabab dene pin#petan
bakul malébeng praja

The Buku's account is confirmed in Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen' p. 71. According
to Smissaert, on 23 August the price of a pika! (62.5 kgs.) of rice rose to the
astonishing figure of 60 silver guilders. (Dj. Br. 54. Smissaert to Res. of
Kéedhu, 23 Aug. 1825 and this is partly confirmed by Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen',
p. 71, who noted that a measure of rice, which outside Yogyakarta cost 50
duits (62.50 cents), sold for 25 silver guilders (Peraks) inside the town). All the
main articles of food (rice, oil, salt and fodder) were lacking and horses were
slaughtered and even ricinus (castor-oil plants) and the trunks of banana trees
were eaten (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Res. of K¥dhu, 1 Aug: 1825; Smissaert
circular letter, 2 Aug. 1825; 1d. to MacGillayry, 3 Aug. 1825; Id. to De Kock
11 Aug. 185; KITLV Or..13,;°K.-5i-2, pp. 116-7). At the same time,
Dipanagara's forces cut off the fresh water supply to the fort, the Residency,
the kraton and the Mésjid Agéng, see Louw; vol. I, p. 301; Payen, 'Voyage', 6
Sept. 1825. The local Javanese also seem to have boycotted Dutch money, one
silver guilder only fetching 2 cents (Dj. Br.-34, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 3
Aug. 1825). The only store of food within the city seems to have been a
warehouse of rice owned by Smissaert. This was used by him somewhat reluc-
tantly during the last weeks of the siege in Sept. 1825 to feed the officers and
troops in Yogya (see Louw, vol. I, p. 277 n. and vAE, Smissaert to King Wil-
liam 1, n.d. (2 Sept. 1828); Payen, 'Voyage', 4 Sept. 1825). Later, when Willem
van Hogendorp visited Yogya in 1827, he described how thousands of coconut
trees had had their tops cut off to be eaten as food and how a handful of rice
had been sold for a guilder (H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem nan Hogendorp,
p. 174). Even as late as September 1825, after the town had been relieved, some
inhabitants were 'still dying of hunger (MvK 4132 'Bylage Smissaert', Smissaert
to De Kock, 12 Sept.: 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 2 Sept. 1825; Louw, I, pp.
354-8.) Many people fled from Yogya .to Kutha G&dhe which became the
main market in the Yogya.area-(KITLV.Or. 13, X. 47-8, pp. 115-6, XIL 3,
p. 124). It. Porter .reported how four Bupatis loyal to Dipanagara at Kutha
Gé&dhe had prevented supplies from reaching Yogya (KITLV H. 263, Portier,
'Verklating', p. 18). All those with rice to sell either gathered there or left for
the villages (KITLV Or. 13, X. 52, p. 117 and Louw, vol. I, p. 289; p. 355).
Sélarong also became an important market centre for the region and when
Maj.-Gen. J. van Geen eventually captured the place in October 1825 he
confirmed that Dipanagara had set up a market there during his stay. (LOr

6547 b, XXII 35-6, pp. 382-3; dK no. 197, J. van Geen to H.M. de Kock, 1
Oct. 1825, and see above n. 29).

ing Bulus Suradilaga/Bupati salor nagari: Suradilaga's appointment as a Bupati
and a commander to the north of Yogya is confirmed in the babads and in the
Dutch reports (dK no. 158, 'Lyst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen heb-
ben opgeworpen', no. 29; Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVIII, p. 732; SB 136, LIV. 21,
p. 238; LOr 6547 b, XXII 47-8, pp. 385-6). In the latter account he is men-
tioned as the guardian @»4ar) of P. Jayakusuma (later P. Ngabehi). Bulus is a
village on the slopes of Mt. Mérapi just above Candhi on the Kali Codhe (see
De Klerck, vol. IV, Map and Dumont, Woordenboek, p. 85).

Wiryawijaya namil.....Tuminggung Natayuda: the babad writer appears to have
confused two different people here. Wiryawijaya has already been referred to

288

Babad Dipanagara

(see above ns. 123 & 202). RT. Natayuda was a Yogya Bupati who came
over to Dipanagara at Sélarong and was made a commander in Lédhok, Go-
wong and Kédhu (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 26, p. 380. XXII. 44, p. 385; dK. no. 158,
'Lyst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen', no. 355;
Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 56; SB 136, LVL 12, p. 250). He was the son of
RT. Natayuda 1, the Bupati Wedana of Kedhu and brother-in-law of Nata-
kusuma, who was poisoned in 1804 (see Poensen, 'Amifigku Buwink IT,
p. 117). Family grievances and the loss of administrative position were prob-
ably two of the factors which persuaded him to join Dipanagara in 1825.

224 Bupati kidul nagarilDyan Tuminggung Amanghuyuda ...... Mangkuyuda is refer-
red to in the Yogya babad as Kyai Mangkuyuda, Lurab pénongrong (chief of the
payung carriers) in the Yogya kraton who went over to Dipanagara at Sélarong
(SB 136, XLVIII 33, p. 202). He was later given command of 1,000 prajwriss
by Dipanagara when the latter was at Junénéng (Kulon Praga) and served to
the south of Yogya (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 32, p. 45).

225 Tuminggung Kertapanawangling Plantaran desa sale n¥gari: there is a reference
to a certain Tuméenggung Jayapénawang in the Buk who operated to the north
of Yogya around Pisangan and Gawok-(KITLV Or. 13 X. 26, p. 110; XXL 16,
p. 127; LOr 2163, XIV. 6, p. 162). Other sources refer to a certain Tum&ng-
gung Urawan, earlier Diémang of Plantaran,, who was also known as
Yudapénawang Adimustapt and Haji Abdulkadir (see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen',
p. 101 and Jas. Corr. no. 148, 11 Dec. 1828). DN made him commander of
the Bulkio regiment (see LOr 6547 b, XXIL 97, p. 398), Plantaran may refer
to Pisangan or to Plémburan, a village three miles to the north of Yogya (IOR
X. IX. 3, 'Topogtaphische Kaart der Res. Djokjakarta® (1861), and there are
also villages by the name of Plumbangan and Putéran in-$. Kédhu (see IOR X.
IX. 4, 'Topographische Kaart der Res. Kadoe! (1860).

226 Martadiwirya Tumenggung/Kemusub desanira; this appears to refer to Ng. Mérta-
diwirya, an official of Danurja from the village of Kemusuh to the west of
Yogya who made a report on Dipanagara's movements after his flight from
Tégalr&ja (SB 136, L.. 13-14, p. 213 and see above n. 197). He apparently
collected taxes in the area for the Patih and was later murdered in a mosque by
Suradilaga (see above n. 222) who seized the Sp. D. 2,000 in tax money he was
carrying (SB 136, LIV. 22-6,-p. 239). There was also another official by the
name of Ng. Mérradiwirya.who went over to Dipanagara at SElarong in the fol-
lowing of the Yogya PZngulu and was later given a command when Dipansgess
was at JumEnEng (Kulon Praga) (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 34, PP. 45-46; KITL®
H 76, p. 2). It is possible that the babad writer has confused the two men.

227 Jayaningrat Kradenan Raden Tuminggung: this refers to the district bess ail
Kradenan in the R&mame district abutting on the southern frontier of
(see IOR X. IX. 4 'Topographische Kaart der Res. Kadoe' (1860) and
vol. III, p. 318). He had apparently been out of favour with the Your®
before 1825 and may have lost some of his lands. He joined DN wish
and younger brother, Cakradirja, early in the war and eventually
1828 (see above n. 123 and Jar. Cour. no. 113, 26 Sept. 1829
tioned his submission to the Dutch with 32 followers in Sept. 1829%

Kéjiwan (9 Aug. 1826) (LOr 6547 ¢, XXV. 245, p. 143), but later gave hims=
up and was retired by the Dutch as head of Rémame in May 1826 because
his advanced years. He apparently lived on bad terms with his elder broth

Jayaningrat, or at least was involved in extensive litigation with him (see BL
Add. MS. 12341, £. 201r-203r).

Tumnggung Nitikramaldess Gondbang bawah Surakart¢ki: for a description &
the site of Gondhang see above n. 125. An official by the name of Nitikrams s
referred to twice in the Dutch reports: first as a Démang of Dipanagara from
Sampar (? Sampar Palian below Wanasari (Gunung Kidul) on the road betwees
Yogya and Pacitan, see Balé Pustaka, Babad Gijant? Pratélan namaning Tijeng
lan Panggénan, p. 81) who was ordered to keep the padi (rice) for the Puasa
taxes of May 1825 to purchase arms (MK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', Mas Nz.
Wiraprana to Danuréja, 16 Jul, 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 390)
Secondly, a certain Nitikrama is mentioned as the Démarg of Bulus. in the
Surakarta area who marched to join Dipanagara's forces in the attack on Yogyz
in Aug. 1825 with two other. Surakarta Demangs (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to
MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825).

Stcanagara Tuminggung/Nelogorok desanira; this seems to refer to Muhamad
Ngarfah, who rallied to Dipanagara at Sélarong, was appointed as TumEnggung
Sécanagara, and took part in the campaign in Kédhu which led to the defeat
and death of the Bupati of Magélang, RT. Danuningrat (LOr 6347 b, XXII
63-4, p. 389-90, XXI:-93-109, pp. 397-401 and see Louw, vol. I, pp
257-9; pp. 467-9). Smissaert mentioned the Naib (religious official) of the vil-
lage of Logorok, a Surakarta hamlet opposite Pisangan on the Magélang-Yogys
road who took patt in the ambush of an expedition from Magtlang to Yogya
which led to the loss of bullion worth f. 28.000 and the death of 40 European
soldiers on 24 Jul. 1825 (dK no. 181, Smissaert to Van-der Capellen, 24 Jul.
1825). It is possible that this Nazb was the same man. The name Ngarfah
recalls the town of Arafa in Arabia, so it is possible he may have made the
pilgrimage to Mecca. Portier in his account mentioned that TunEnggung Séca-
négara had earlier borne the name of Jayam@nggala (KITLV H 263, 'Verklar-
ing', p. 25 and see above n. 166.)

Kerangtalun Mériawijaya -on Méttawijaya see above n. 123.
Karangtalun is a village in the Bligo area, a spit of land between the Praga and
Krasak rivers, which was a Yogya enclave in $..Kédhu until 1830 (see Afdeling
Statistiek, De Residentie Kadee, p. 49 and IOR X. TX. 4, 'Topographische Kaart
der Res. Kadoe' (1860).

23la sinungan nawala sampunikang bongga pinatenan: instructions such as these can

232

be clearly seen in the letrer from Dipanagara to the chiefs of Kedhu which was
carried by Hasan Bésari at the end of July. This ordered the local population
to collect arms, seize control of the province and further the Islamic religion. It
anyone refused to obey the instructions in the letter they were to be put to
death (dK no. 182, P. le Clercq to De Kock, 29 Jul. 1825 enclosing the letter
of Hasan Bésari, and see further Muhammad Yamin, Peperengen
Dipanagare, (Djakarta, 1952), p. 41 and Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage XLVIII, who cite
the letter in full).

ingaran wadya barandhal: brandbal means a good-for-nothing, a scoundrel, a
predator, rebel and freebooter etc. (GR, vol. 11, p. 668). The numbers of wong
durjana in Dipanagara's ranks may have elicited the term (see above n. 36) and
it was first used in a proclamation issued under the name of Sultan Haméng-
kubuwana V on 1 Sura, Wawu, A.J. 1753 (15 Aug. 1825) in which prices were
set on the heads of captured rebels: for a Temenggung, f. 1,000, for an impor-
tant leader, f. 500, for a minor leader, £. 100 and for an ordinary brandbal, £.

Babad Dipanagara

25 «KITLV H 699, AvJ no. 28b, 'Bekendmaking', p. 35). Although it was used
y as a derisory expression it was also employed as a description for the
5 of franc-tireurs (snipers) drawn from the villages which were set up by
e Sunan and Mangkun&gara II in first months of the war to combat Dipana-
zara's supporters (see Louw, vol. I, p. 282).

  
 

Giz) wima jroning praja: this is confirmed in the other Javanese and Dutch
reports of the situation inside Yogyakarta at the time of Dipanagara's attacks
m the town in Aug. 1825. On 1 Aug. Smissaert described an attack by
Dipanagara's supporters on the area of the wite paal (Tugu) to the north of the
sown where houses and warnngs were burnt. Later, villages in the neighbour-
bood of Yogya were set alight and on 15 Aug. the dafém of P. Paku Alam was
burnt. The previous day (14 Aug.) the Chinese area (Rampung cina) was fired
and a pall of smoke hung over the town (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry,
1 Aug. 1825, Id. to Id., 3 Aug. 1823; dK no. 181, Smissaert to De Kock, 13
Aug. and 14 Aug. 1825, and see further KITLV Or. 13, X. 35-44, pp. 112-5;
Javadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 70; Louw, vol. 1, p. 300). When Willem van
Hogendorp later visited Yogya he reported that everything between the fort
and the witte paal on the road to Magélang had been destroyed. This was partly
because many Javanese nobles and priyayis had set fire to their own daléms
before going over to join Dipanagara in order to prevent them falling into
enemy hands, see H. Graaf van Hogendorp, pp. 173-4.

Walonda kakalib lanpusiliya- nandhang brana: see above n. 192. Only one Ambo-
nese (?) was reported as killed on the Dutch side and the cavairy commander,
Lt. Thierry, later committed suicide (Chevallier, 'Dag-Register', 27 Jul. 1825
Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 401). The psychological impact of killing Euro-
peans was, however, of great importance. Thus, when a Dutch hussar was kill-
ed on 23 Aug. by a stab from a Aris, his blood was drunk; and his head struck
off and paraded around the town (D). Br. 54, Smissaett to P. le Clercq, 23
Aug. 1825 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 538 for reference to the custom of DN's
troops of cutting off the heads of slain Dutch soldiers).

pamaftgan kinen kunipul this refers to the Surakarta officials who administered
lands in the Sala mancanagare areas and who rendered their tax twice a year at
Puasa and Mulud at the kraton (GR, vol. I, p. 150); Presumably they were still
in attendance in Surakarta because the Garébtg-Prase had just occurred (20
May 1825) and they were often held over to provide labour services
for the Sunan.

ngalum-alun paseban: the paseban was the area on the northern alun-alun of the
Surakarta kraton which was used as a gathering place for officials (GR, vol. 1, p.
490). It should be noted that regarding this meeting at break of day on the
alun-alun, the text as it now stands seems confused. It is unclear whether, once
he had taken his leave of the Resident, the Raden Adipati entered a private
room in the paseban building or remained in the Residency. The latter seems to
be implied by the text (see XI. 16 and XL 23), but by the end of the canto (X1.
28-29) it is clear that the Patih and his officials were already at the pasehan.
When the transfer took place is not mentioned.

busanane prajuritan: the normal Javanese battle dress (Prajuritan) is described
by Gericke and Roorda (GR, vol. II, p. 241) as 'a kind of uniform with AZ
(Rain about the lower body and legs) and célana (trousers) and blamb sikipan (a
jacket worn when armed), xab¥rg (headkerchief), one éris in the belt and one
hanging on a belt. There is a picture of a Javanese noble dressed in prajwritan
in Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 90 facing.

Historical Notes & Commentary

.... kulukan: refers to a state head-dress, which has fixed above it a small i
shaped hat without a rim. The dress is usually worn by Javanese nobles a=

officials at state ceremonies and by a Javanese bridegroom at his wedding (GE
vol. 1, p. 490).

hadya Meru padma kobaripinganggone para Mantri: Meru refers to the boi
mountain Mt. Meru in India, the seat of Brahma, which is very important i=
the Javanese view as the symbol of cosmic power of the kraton and the rule
(GR, vol. II, p. 479; Robert Heine-Geldern 'Conceptions of State and King
ship in Southeast Asia, Cornell University Data Paper no. 18, (Ithaca, 1956). !=
Javanese mythology and literature Meru was supposed to be able to displace
itself to Java (see Pigeaud, Literature, vol. 11, p. 258). The striking red colous
of the used by the Mantris at the courts probably prompted the

metaphor, see RAS, Raffles MSS. vol. 3, 'Miscellaneous Memorandum on the
court of Solo' (1816).

rakusuma, who was a brother of R. Adip. Sasradiningrat, was a Sala Nayeéz
(Wedana Kiparak Tingin). Sastawinata, who may also have been a relation of
the Sala Patih, was in charge of road and bridge construction (see IOL Jav. 98
F, 'Pratelanipun abdi-dalem Bupati ing Surakarta sadaya' (21812).

Sriminganti...... the name of the northern outer gate of the innermost part of
the kraton which led-to the Sunan's private apartments. There was a pindbaps

there for receiving highly placed officials (GR, vol. I, p. 776; Winter, 'Bek-
nopte Beschrijving', pp. 35-6).

 

ngandika Sri Naranatal ...Jkang ngaturi wuninga marang mami: the non-
committal and sphinx-like reply of the Sunan, Pakubuwana VI (1823-30), to
the news that the Dutch had asked for reinforcements from Surakarta is indica-
tive of his wavering attitude at the beginning of the Java War. Thus in the
Buku, there is the description of a meeting between the Sunan and the
Surakarta Patih, Sasradiningrat, at about this time, in which the former is
described as having been very reluctant to provide troops for the Dutch but
having been overruled by Sasradiningrat's advice that it was not yet the time to
dpvc the Durch from Java (KITLV Or. 13, XIV.28-38, pp. 151-3; on the
dispatch of troops from Sala see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 550). It is
certain that he secretly sympathised with Dipanagers and in another passage in
the Buku he is castin the role of Prabu.Baladewa, the ruler of Madura in the
wayang theatre, who was strongly sympathetic to the Kurawa cause yet was
tricked by Prabu Kresna into meditating at Grojogan Sewu and thus missed
taking part in the Bratayuda, the final contest between Kurawa and Pandhawa
(LOr 2163, XX124-9, p. 277; Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 44-6). There
was much discontent in Surakarta at the time because of the ending of the land
rent and recent annexations of territory (see Van der Kemp, 'De Economische
Oorzaken', passim and the Introduction pt. IV), and through Kyai Maja the
court was kept closely informed of events in Yogya (Van Pabst, 'Nota' (1826).
Indeed, the first notice of Dipanagara's preparations which was received by the
Dutch, was the decision of the Démeng of Grojogan, near Sala, to march to
Yogya to join the prince's forces (see above n. 112). On 25 July, the Surakarta
Resident, MacGillayry, wrote to Van der Capellen detailing the strength of
popular discontent in mencamagers areas adjacent to Surakarta: '... 1 will not
conceal from Your Excellency how much it cost me to hold the neighbouring
eastern areas of Yogya under control. If the local chiefs decide to join the
rebels, the oppressed people will be ready immediately to follow them and the
Chinese are their first victims...." (dK no. 183, MacGillavry to Van der Capel-
len, 25 Jul. 1825, 10 p.m.) Although the Sunan gave permission for his troops

> keep the road between Surakarta and Yogyakarca open, he sent a secret
message to his army commander, Major Tirtadiwiria, that if Dipanagara's troops
penetrated as far as D¥langgu, they should be allowed to pass unhindered to
Sala. MacGillavry thereupon sent an urgent request for De Kock to proceed
forthwith from Semarang to Surakarta (dK no. 183, MacGillayry to de Kock,
28 Jul. 1825, 2.30 a.m.) De Kock's timely arrival on 30 July and his diploma-
tc manner with the Sunan just prevented the defection of the Surakarta court
to Dipanagara (see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), pp. 542-551; Louw, I,
pp. 274-6, p. 283, II, pp. 7-14). After De Kock's arrival, the Assistant-
Resident, A.D. Cornets de Groot, wrote that Surakarta remained very quiet
during the first month of the war and superficially well-disposed towards the
Dutch (KB. Cornets de Groot private coll. IX pt. 6, pp. 15-16, A.D. Cornets
de Groot Jr. to A.D. Cornets de Groot Sr., 2 Aug. 1825). Earlier, according to
Nahuys van Burgst, P. Buminata, the Sunan's grand-uncle, had advised the
seaunchly pro-Dutch prince, Mangkun@gara II, to offer no resistance to
Dipanagara's followers and the Sunan himself and the, leading Surakarta Pange-
rans acquiesced in the plan. But the solace (ohas) afforded by the presence of
De Kock in the Sunan's capital caused the members of the court to forego
their plans (on this see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), pp. 555-556; dK 95,
Nahuys van Burgst to De Kock, 2 Sept 1828; De Kock to Nahuys van Burgst,
4 Sept. 1828; Louw, 1, pp=o275-6; II, pp. 362-6, 474; De Klerck, IV, pp.
475-87). Despite this change of heart, another serious anti-Dutch conspiracy
took place in 1828 involving.che father and grandfather of the famous court
poet Raden Ngabchi Ronggawarsita (1802-73) (see Jar. Cour. no. 69, 7 Jun.
1828 and the file on this incident in MvK 4132). As far as the Dutch were
concerned the Sunan-remained an unsatisfactory ally throughout the course of
the war and his pilgrimage to Manciagan in June 1830 provided them with a
useful pretext to exile him and raise P. Purbaya as Pakubuwana VII (see Lapo-
ran Politik Tabu» 1837, pp. 59-60 and De Klerck, vol. VI, pp. 101-151).

.... Residhen Dbomis: Hendrik Jacob Domis (1782-1842) was Resident of
Semarang (1822-27) and later served in Pasuruan (1828-31). He was the
author of two important published reports on Java, see T.J. Bezemer (ed.),
Beknopte Encyclopaedia van Nederlandsch-Indie (s-Hage & Leiden, 1921), p. 137.

243 ing Rédi Kidul kakalih: Gunuog Kidut had been jointly held by Surakarta and

Yogyakarta since the treaty of Giyanti (1755). The region appears to have gone
over to Dipanagara at the stare of the war; thus on 29 July, Smissaert warned
MacGillayry that the Sampar Palian area on the road to Pacitan, which was held
jointly by the two courts, was providing support for Dipanagara (Dj. Br. 54,
Smissaert to MacGillayry, 29 Jul. 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp.
404-5) and early in August Dipanagara went there in person to gather troops
(Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Commander of Yogya garrison, 13 Aug. 1825).
Dipanagara's son, P. Dipaatmaja, was also active in the area (see Louw, vol. I,
p. 578). Both Gunung Kidul and Pacitan were politically disturbed areas; much
labour had been demanded in the former province to harvest the edible birds's
nests (mainly at Rongkob), and in Pacitan forced labour had been employed on
the coffee and pepper plantations. There had even been some decline in popu-
lation in this latter area, after it had been annexed to the European government
in 1812, because of the harshness of the estate system (AvJ. Nahuys van
Burgst to Van der Capellen, 2 Sept. 1822 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 578 n. 3 and
R.A. Kern, 'Uit Oude Bescheiden (Geschiedenis van de Afdeccling Patjitan in
de Eerste helft der 19¢ ceuw) met bijlage', TBB, vol. 34 (1908), pp. 157-

190). The first people to be attacked were the European estate inspectors

6 Aug. one of Dipanagara's messengers, Ahmad Daris, arrived in eas-
Gunung Kidul and Pacitan and won over the government Bupati, Kyai T. !
karia, who carried the area for the prince. The government inspector of cul
Wormer, narrowly escaped with his life by disguising himself as a Hay? (dK =
183, MacGillavry to Van der Capellen, 11 Aug. 1825 enclosing Worme:s
report of the same date, and see further KITLV H 263, P.D. Portier, 'Verkis>
ing and Louw, vol. I, pp. 576-8). Lt. Portier's mission to Gunung Kidul almos
certainly had a connection with the beginnings of the uprising against the
Dutch in the area. It has not, however, been possible to identify Naladikrams
and Réesastmita, but a full account of this incident can be found in A.P. Buck-
ler, 'Socrakarta voor 63 jaren' TNI (1888) vol. II, p. 30.

 

 

244 Tawan Litnan Portir......: this refers to 2nd Lt. Paul Daniel Portier, inspector of
birds' nest rocks at Rongkob (apziener der vogelnesthlippen te Ronghob) amd
Adjutant (ordonnans) of the Surakarta Residency (Regeerings Almanak (1825). p
55). He was later captured by the Bupati of Pacitan, Kyai T. Jagakaria, in ©
Sept. 1826 and was interviewed by Dipanagara. He affected to become a Mus-
lim after proving that he had.been circumcised and had learnt various Islam
prayers and the articles of the faith (i@@hadar). He was given the name of Nur-
salim, a horse, insignia and military rank, and Dipanagara wished to make him
the head of his administrators in Rongkob, because he placed more faith in his
administration than thatof a Javanese (Portier, 'Verklating', p. 22; H. Graaf van
Hogendorp, Willew van Hogendorp in Nederlandsch-Indi?, 1825-1830, p. 156
Portier later wrote an interesting account of his experiences with Dipanagara's
troops, see KITLV H 263, Portier, 'Verklaringn.d. He should not be con-
fused with Ist Lt. Jan Pieter Portier who was Adjutant {rdonnans) of P. mang-
kundgara II and took part in various compaigns with the MN troops, see Louw,
1, p. 386,.p. 563 ff., p. 574. On the members of the Portier family in Sala at

this time, see MvK 3141, 'Register van het Europese personcele op Java,
(1823).

244a samya tugur ngalun-alun) Bupati makajangan: tugur has the meaning of
a special warch performed by court officials and members of the royal family
at the time of the installation or death of a Javenese ruler (see GR, vol. I,
p. 712). A Dutch description of this practice at the time of the death of HB V
in Yogya in June 1855 can be found in-Dj. Br. 1, 'Politieke Verslag, 1855.
At that time, the Yogya princes slept in the court pavilions (pendhapas) and the Patih
and other officials camped out on the atur-aiun for over a month (4 Jun.-5 Jul. 1855)
until the appointment of HB VJ.

245 Tuwan Dhomis was praptal.....Jkang saking ing Surakarta: see above n. 201. The
letters from Surakarta were first received by the Assistant-Resident of
SEmarang, J. A.R. Caspersz, because Domis was then absent inspecting the govern-
ment opium estates at Kopeng. He only returned to Semarang on 22 July
when he probably called the meeting described in this babad. Domis wrote that
all was peaceful but that passes had been issued to all Javanese who wished to
travel to the villages (see below n. 249). On 24 July, when news reached him
of the ambush of the Magélang expedition to Yogya (see above n. 230), he
ordered the Bupatis of Kendhal and D&mak to gather a large body of Javanese
troops and post them on the southern frontier of the Residency to give news
of any attack. Meanwhile, artillery was placed at Salatiga and the Jayeng S¥kars
(local mounted constabulary) were called up. On 26 July the Bupati of
Semarang, R. Adip. Aria Cakranagara, was ordered to stay in Salatiga to organ-
ise the police force there (dK no. 180, Domis to alg. Sect., 22 Jul. 1823,
1d. to Id., 24 Jul. 1825, Id. to Id., 26 Jul. 1823). The course of events in
SEmarang after the receipt of the news of Dipanagara's rebellion, as it is related

Babad Dipanagara

= this babad, is thus substantially correct. See further Louw, vol. I, Chap. XIV,
espc. p. 372 and Van der Kemp (ed.), 'Brieven van en aan Mr. van de Graaff
vol. 11, pp. 271-4.

<4. Reden Dipati wus mangiuklAriya Cakranagara: Cakranagara is mentioned in the

Regserings Almanak (1825), p. 54, as Bupati of SEmarang at the beginning of
the Java War.

24° Tewan Serwasis.....: this seems to refer to Willem Nicolaas Servatius, Resident
of SEmarang (1820-22) and earlier J. A. van Braam's Assistant in Surakarta (see
Quarles van Ufford, 'Naamlijst van Hoofden', p. 125, p. 127). It is possible
that he might have been in SEmarang at the outbreak of the war, but unlikely
in view of the fact that he lived mostly at his estate at Kampongbaru in the
Buitenzorg area (see De Haan, 'Personalia', p. 645). He later became Resident
at Preanger in 1827 and died insolvent in the same year. The babad writer
would probably have known of his name because of his earlier career in
Surakarta. There was also a Capt. J.J. Servais in $¥marang at the beginning of
Aug. 1823, see Louw, vol. I, p. 296.

247a /umembak para upésir: the senior officers in Semarang at the time were
Col. F. von Jett, Commander .of the 2nd «Military Division and Col. J.A.
Hoorn who later replaced him, see Louw, vol 1, p. 366 and Van der Kemp
(ed), 'Brieven.van en aan Mr. van de Graaff, vol. I, pp. 273-4.

248 king babawab ing pasisir kabupatens under the control of
Semarang at this time were Kendhal, Démak, and Grobogan. The two former
areas had Assistant-Residents and Grobogan was administered by a European
land-rax inspector (opzitner van landelik stelsel).

249 strat ginab.....: see above n. 245. The system of passes was not new and had
been used earlier by Daendels to check the circulation of religious officials
between the pasisir and the worstenlanden (see J.A. Van der Chijs (ed.)
Nederlandsch-Indisch Plakaathock, 1602-1811, vol. XVI (s-Hage, 1897), p.
409, order of 16 Herfismaand (Sept.) 1810). In 1824 this regulation was still in
force for Smissaert mentioned that a travel pass cost 45 duits (9 stuivers) (Dj.
Br. 53, Smissaert to Pres: of the Financial Board at Batavia, 18 Feb. 1824). A
local pass was written on the left in Javanese and:on'the right in Dutch and was

endorsed by the local Resident (see LOr 2168, mo. 111, 'Binnenlandsche Pas
voor (J.) F.C. Gericke',-19 Jul. 1828).

250 angangge sandi-upaya: in his survey of Old Javanese literature Prof. P.J. Zoet-
mulder gives the following description of the Old Jav. term wpZy@ sandbi: 'A
well-known chapter in the Indian and Old Javanese treatises on the government
of kings enumerate the four means (4p23«) of dealing with one's enemies. They
are sama (negotiation), dana (bribery). bheda (sowing of discord) and danda
(violence). As the first two are considered to be peaceful means, they are clas-
sed under the term spay sandbi. These non-violent means are also described

as "subtle means" (s2ksmapay«) or "secret means" (rabasyopaya) ..... ' (Zoetmul-
der, Kalangwan. A Survey of Old Javanese Literature, (The Hague, 1974), p.
182).

essay 'On the meaning of Javanese drama', in Panji, the Culture Hero, (Tee

story is referred to in connection with Dipanagara, when the latter's followe»
Kyai Jayanodin, receives a vision of the prince riding a cow as big as a hi.
which had its feet caught in the roots of a Balaran vine. The cow broke loose
and quickly carried Dipanagara off with it, thus depicting the destructive forces
which would be unleashed in Java by Dipanagara: KITLV Or. 13. VII (Mas-
kumambang). p. 75:

For a further discussion of this episode as it occurs in the Buku, see Carey
'Cultural Ecology', p. 39. and Forrester, 'The Java War', pp. 60-62.

tur sam? trah ing Mataram: this is a general reference to the fact that Mang»
kubumi and Dipanagara were descended from the Royal House of Mataram, of
whom the Sultans of Yogyakarta formed one branch, See above n. 213 for

confirmation of the babad writer's shrewd assessment of Mangkubumi's charac-
ter.

Rigen sawiji tindbibe: see above n. 245, which describes the placing of Bupatis
on the southern frontier of the S¥marang Residency. The fact that the word
Regen (Regent) is used and not the Javanese term Bupati is because the Bupatis
of the pastsir areas had long been under the influence of the Dutch and were
soon to become salaried officials-of the colonial government. The title 'Regent'
was used by the Dutch to refer to Bupatis under their administration. See

further L.W.C. van den Berg, De Inlandsche Rangen en Titels op Java en Madera
('s-Gravenhage, 1902), pp. 61-64.

kadya ginubab; this refers to the campake or magnolia tree which has
white or yellow tulip-shaped flowers and carries a very distinctive scent. The
phrase dpake ginubah (lit. 'like a finely shredded campaha') is used as an ex-
pression in Javanese to indicate someone whose heart is rent by grief, see De
Clereq, Nieuw Plantkundig Woordenboek, p. 280, no. 2295 and GR, vol. I, p.
296. On Smissaert's attitude see above n. 153 and Van der Kemp, 'Hamler-
type', p. 391. His inability in getting on with his subordinates at this time was
described by Louw, vol. I, p. 280, and his fearfulness was remarked on by Van
der Capellen, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 363.

rake Dyan Adipatya: normally a Dutch Resident would never address the Patih
as 'elder brother" but rather as 'younger brother' (ar). The term may have been
used here intentionally by the babad writer to indicate Smissaert's dependence
on Danuréja (see the Introduction pr. IV).

hang sami tinggal wismane: this is confirmed by Smissaert in a letter of 6 Aug.
1825 in which he noted that most of the kraton abdi-da/tms, officials and pra-
jurits had deserted Yogya during the first two weeks of the war (Dj. Br. 54,

ssert to P.le Clercq, 6 Aug. 1825 and see furcher Louw, 1, p. 261 and

abs para Tuniénggung: the administration of this
seh before Smissaert and Paku Alam was mentioned by Smissaert in a letter to
Was der Capellen (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 405). The oath was a
seseration of the usual pledge of allegiance to the Dutch government which
was taken by all Bupatis and other officials on the assumption of office. Paku
Alzm apparently advised Smissaert to hold the oath-taking ceremony in the
imdcncy, but it did not prevent several more Yogya TamBnggengs and princes

Voyage, 22 Jul. 1825) referred to the singularly inappropriate speech which
Senissaert made to the Javanese princes and Bupatis at this time ("I know well",

Senissaert said, "that it would be easy for you to massacre all the Europeans
who are here (in Yogya) because there are thousands of Javanese against one
European), but if that happens, the Government will send others" ..., where-
pon Payen added, 'one can imagine what an effect such a speech produced

amongst the Javanese and Europeans ... it was enough to deter the most resol-
are'.)
