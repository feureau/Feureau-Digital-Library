## a. Introduction
The historian who wishes to make a study of the Java War (1825-1830) and its antecedents is faced with an unusually rich collection of Javanese historical materials on which to draw. These materials include both original letters and Babads (Javanese historical chronicles) written by participants in the events, but of these the Babad accounts are by far the most important. These Javanese histories are usually classified under the loose title of 'Babad Dipanagara' in library catalogues, although they often deal with very different facets of Pameran Dipanagara's struggle against the Dutch, and are sometimes even written by men who took part on opposing sides during the war. Most of the original 'Babad Dipanagara' and their MS. copies are kept in public collections in the Netherlands and in Indonesia, although there are still a few in private family collections The most important public collections are those of the Leiden University Library (The Netherlands), the Museum Pusat (Jakarta), the Kraton (court) Libraries of Surakarta and Yogyakarta (Central Java), and the Library of the Sana Budaya Museum (Yogyakarta). [Footnote: For descriptions of the Babad Dipanagara in the Leiden University Library, see Dr. Th. G. Th. Pigeaud, Literature of Java, 3 Vols, Nijhoff, The Hague, 1967-1970; for the collection in the Museum Pusat, see Jaarboek van het Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap van kunsten en wetenschappen, Nix & Co, Bandung 1933, p. 290; for the Yogyakarta Kraton Collection, see Drs. Mujanattistomo, Katalogus Manuskrip Kraton Jogjakarta, Lembaga Bahasa Nasional publication, Yogyakarta, 1971; a catalogue of MSS. in the Surakarta Kraton Library will be published by Dr. N. Girardet in W. Germany shortly, There is no published catalogue of the Sana Budaya Collection.] The absence of any comprehensive survey of this Babad material which could give a guide as to the location of the original MSS., their dates and background, makes the task of the historian exceedingly difficult. Meanwhile the amount of published material is still pitifully small and is often as hard to come by as the MSS. themselves.

In order to make a general classification as to the most important MSS., that is those which were written by authors who had a first hand knowledge of the events they described, it seems possible to divide the Babads now known under the general title of 'Babad Dipanagara' into three main groups. Firstly there are the accounts written by Paneran Dipanagara himself whilst in exile in Menado (1830-1833) and in Makassar (1833-1855), and later on in the nineteenth century by members of Dipanagara's own family. Babad Dipanagara Menado Version; LOr 6547 a-d, BG 149 (4 Vols), BG 282 (Pegon) and BG 283 (Jav. script), there are further two books of notes on Javanese history and Islam written by Dipanagara in Makassar and owned by his descendants. Babad Dipanagaran Suryarngalam, LOr 6488, written by Raden Mantri Mohammed Arip (alias P. Dipanagara II), Dipanagara's second eldest son. LOr 6199-6200 which deals with Yogyakarta history from 1812-1830 was written by P. Suryawijaya, a younger brother of Dipanagara in collaboration with a Dutch inhabitant of Yogyakarta, A. N. Dom. Of these Babad accounts Pangeran Dipanagara's autobiography is the best known and was used by both Louw and de Klerck for their history of the Java War. P.J.F. Louw and E.S. de Klerck, De Java Oorlog, 6 Vols, Batavia and The Hague 1894-1909. Both these historians used a Dutch translation BG 314 now in the Museum Pusat (see Not.KBG. Mrt. 1893). A part of this autobiographical Babad has been published by Rusche & Co in Surakarta in 1908-1909, 1914, and 1917, but it seems certain that this publication was not based on the original MS. (Serat Babad Dipanagaran, 2 Vols, Rusche & Co. Surakarta 1908-1909, Jav. char. Vol. 1 314 pp., Vol. 2 268 pp., 2nd ed. 1914, 3rd ed. 1917.) Indeed, despite its popularity it must still remain a somewhat dubious source for the historian as no original MS. has come to light since A.B. Cohen Stuart made the copies, which are now in the Museum Pusat, in the 1870s. (See Not.KBG. 5 June 1877 pp. 89-95, and S. van Praag, Onrust op Java: De jeugd van Dipanegara; een Historisch-Literaire Studie, Amsterdam 1947, p. 23.)

Secondly there is the group of Babads written at the courts of Central Java during the course of the nineteenth century often by men who had a direct experience of the events they described. This group of Babads has been totally ignored by historians even though it contains the only Babad written during the Java War itself, and the only Babad based effectively on both Javanese and Dutch sources. (Yogyakarta Kraton, LOr 8552 a-c, the earliest copy of which was written in 1876 by R. Adip. Danureja V (1847-1879) and P. Suryanagara and was based on Dutch and Javanese materials; a further copy is in the Yogya Kraton Library, No. A.62. Surakarta Kraton, LOr 2114, which is a fragment of a longer Babad and was written on 19 Besar, Be, A.J. 1752 (6 Aug. 1825)). These court Babads certainly deserve much more attention in the future and give an important insight into the equivocal attitude of the Central Javanese courts towards Pangeran Dipanagara's struggle against the Dutch.

The third group of Babads is that which is known under the general title of 'Buku Kedhung Kebo', written some time after the end of the Java War and so called because of the original name of the settlement on the Bagawanta river (Bagelen) which was afterwards known as Purwareja. (See Pigeaud op. cit. Vol.I p.168 and Vol.2 pp.35, 69, and 78; see also A. C. Vreede, Catalogus van de Javaansche en Madoereesche Handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits Bibliotheek, Brill, Leiden 1892, pp. 136-143.) These Babads, many of them almost exactly similar in style and content, were apparently written on the orders of the first Bupati of Purwareja after the war, Raden Adipati Cakranagara I (1830-1862), to glorify his own exploits and those of his Dutch allies in the Bagelen area during the course of the Java War, and to provide a foundation charter for the new dynasty of Bupatis which he had founded in Bagelen. Because Cakranagara I's position was almost entirely due to the prestige and rank he had earned during the Java War, the events of those years were of considerable importance for his family history. The oldest Kedhun Kebo MS. appears to be LOr. 2163 of the Leiden University Library which was apparently begun in 1842 and finished sometime in the following year, although the chronograms and dates which are given in the introduction are not entirely clear. This MS. was given to Governor-General J.J. Rochussen (1845-1851) when he was on tour in Central Java in 1847, and was passed on to his friend J.C. Baud, then Chairman of the Koninklijk Instituut, when he returned to the Netherlands. Baud asked Taco Roorda to make a translation, and Roorda in turn sought the unwilling help of C.F. Winter in Surakarta; after some difficulties a translation of the first 200 pages of the MS. was published in Bijdragen in 1860. (T. Roorda, Verhaal van de oorsprong en het begin van de opstand van Dipa Negara volgens een Javaansch Handschrift, BKI 1860 (3) pp. 137-227.) Various other MSS. copies of the Buku. Kedhun Kebo were completed during the years between 1843 and Cakranagara I's death in 1862, but they differ very little from the original. Finally in the latter part of the nineteenth century a MS. of the Buku was published by Van Dorp in Semarang, but although this publication seems to have been popular in Java, it is now virtually unobtainable. A full description of this publication was made by R. Poerwasoewignja and R. Wirawangsa in the Pratelan of 1920. (R. Poerwasoewignja and R. Wirawangsa, Pratelan, Batavia 1920, pp. 150-159.)

Meanwhile the real authorship of the Buku Kedhung Kebo has remained a mystery even though it is known that the original conception of the work and some of its composition can be attributed to Cakranagara I. The nature of the Buku itself, of which the first part is devoted to the history of Yogyakarta and Pangeran Dipanagara between 1812 and 1825 and the second part is almost entirely concerned with the fighting in Bagelen and Banyumas and the history of Purwareja after the Java War, suggests that it may have been the work of more than one person. There are also various stylistic differences and the latter part of the Buku contains more Malay words and Javanese idioms from the Semarang area. This lack of any really firm data as to the authorship and historical viewpoint of the Buku Kedhung Kebo has meant that it has been used hardly at all as a source by historians despite Roorda's translation and its pro-Dutch bias, which could enable it to be used successfully as a comparative account against Dipanagara's own autobiographical Babad and the Babads written in the Central Javanese courts.

The published version does however give a clue as to one of the possible co-authors of the Buku Kedhung Kebo and in the introduction to this text he is named as Ali Basah Kerta Pengalasan, one of Dipanagara's most trusted army-commanders (Basah) during the Java War. This fact has not apparently been noticed before and often Kedhun Kebo MSS. which have this particular introduction are classified under a different heading in library catalogues: thus LOr. 8553 of the Leiden University Library is referred to as the 'Ali Basah Babad' in Dr. Pigeaud's catalogue. Pigeaud op. cit. Vol. II p. 480. A comparison of the first lines of the cantos shows clearly however that this particular Babad is nearly the same as the published version, which is in turn closely related to the other Kedhun Kebo MSS. (See Soegiarto, List of first lines, LOr 10.867 D, and Pratelan op. cit. pp. 150-159.) The remainder of this article will be concerned first with a comparative survey of the various introductions to the different types of Kedhung Kebo MSS. (part b), secondly with short biographical sketches of Cakranagara and Pengalasan (parts c and d), and finally some tentative conclusions as to the possible format of the composition of the Buku and its importance as an historical source for the period of Pameran Dipanagara (1785-1855) and the Java War (1825-1830) (part e).

## b. Comparative Survey of Kedhung Kebo MSS.
It is impossible within the scope of this article to make a comparative survey of all the available Kedhun Kebo MSS., but the following introductions are taken from the three most important MSS. composed during the nineteenth century. The first is from the oldest extant Kedhung Kebo MS., LOr. 2163, which has already been discussed. The second is taken from a MS. in the possession of the Koninklijk Instituut (Leiden), KITLV Or. 13, which was copied during the period of R. Adip. Cakranagara II (1862-?) and is in fact only a fragment of the main work. (12 See Pigeaud op. cit. Vol. II p. 825 and BKI Vol. 69 p. 398.) Finally a third introduction is taken from a MS. in the Sana Budaya Museum Library (Yogyakarta), P.B. (Panti Budaya) MS. A. 282, which is almost exactly similar to the published version, because the latter was not available when this article was written.

Introduction to LOr. 2163:

Translation:
>This was begun to be written  
in the year Alip,  
the month was Jumadilawal,  
the wuku Julungpujut  
on the date of the first,  
on Wednesday Pon in the morning  
in the second season.

>The chronogram was reckoned,  
(But) it is a question whether it is correct  
because of the stupidity of the poet,  
the windu was the windu Setra.  
Now the chronogram is  
catur in syaranin ratu (A.J. 174(?)/A.D. 1843?)  
The Raden Adipati wished it.

>Formerly the honourable Raden Adipati  
intended this Babad to be written  
so that later it could be passed on  
to his children, grandchildren,  
great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren  
so that they will know of it,  
understanding all of them in the future.

>So that in the end those who did not know  
would all be mindful of  
the tale of their grandfather's career  
from the time when he followed  
His Excellency Prince  
Kusumayuda  
(until) the return of the honourable Prince (from Bagelen).

(Then follow five verses which describe the new command given to Cakranagara (then Cakrajaya) by Col. Cleerens after the departure of Pangeran Kusumayuda (the Surakarta commander) in Jan. 1829 from Bagelen, and Cakranagara's trials in the fighting against Dipanagara's troops in the area.)

>Now the Raden Adipati  
has his seat in Purwareja.  
He was raised up by the great Company  

(The Government of the Netherlands Indies was still referred to in Javanese Babads as the 'Company' (Jav. Kumpeni, Kumpni) in recollection of the Dutch East India Company, the V.O.C. (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie), until quite late in the 19th century.)

>(and) the ruler of Holland.

(This most probably refers to King William I of the Netherlands (1815-1840).)

>He was raised in rank.  
The forefathers of his father and mother  
assisted him (in the spirit) and gave him grace.

>From the beginning till now
the Raden Adipati has attained his noble rights.  
He has already gained all his desires  
in the year of the Prophet which was reckoned  
one thousand two hundred  
and fifty years stop  
for the name (number) was without head (unit).

(The final lines of this stanza are quite muddled and the dates given are equally confused.)

>We tell of the chronogram for the year of the Prophet  
tataning netra awarna (A.H. 125(9?)/A.D. 1843)  
the chronogram for the Javanese year is told as pandhita wikunin condra (A.J.; 177(1?)/A.D. 1843)  
in the year one thousand seven hundred  
fifty seventy  
and one without head (unit).  

> After stating the chronograms  
now is mentioned  
the realm of Mataram, to begin with  
Yogyakarta Adinigrat.  
The ruler was visited by the anger  
of the Almighty
and disappeared in a storm.

(This refers to the storming of the Yogyakarta Kraton by the British troops on the 20th June 1812 and the exile of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II (1792-1810/1811-1812/1826-1828) to Pulau Pinang on the 28th June.)

Koninklijk Instituut Or. 13:

At the top of the opening pages: 'Pupuh Asmaradana', signifying the Asmaradana metre

>Kasmaran samar ing galih

(Suggest samar instead of sumarya which is given in the MS. and has one syllable too many.)

>galihye pekir kan nistha  
sangking sru sanget papane  
kinunjara neng Samarang  
mangkya seseming driya  
amurwa lelakonipun  
Pangeran Dipanagara.

>Duk arsa mangun agami  
ngrata ing rat tanah Jawi  
carita puniku wite  
anurun kagunganira  
nengih Mangunsubrata  
Mister Jawa kang linuhung

>Mangunsubrata ingkang wit

Mas Behi Sutanegara*  
Patih dibya ing Samarang

>Nuju Pujut wukuneki

Mas Behi Sutanegara*  
dennya nurun carita  
Dyan Dipati langkung wirya  
ing negari Purwareja.

>Amangke* Raden Dipati

Kumpeni kang lairake  
Tuwan Besar ing Nedherlan

>Mila ta kangsi samangkin  
Dyan Dipati langkun wirya  
dumugi barang karsane  
ejrah Nabi dipun etang  
sirna* tasik raningrat  
menggah ing sengkala* Jawa.

This stanza has line f. missing in the MS. which may account for the fact that the sense is not entirely clear.

>Bumi ardi resi sij  
ing mangke* amangun kondha  
nagri Mentaram kandhane  
ingih nagari Ngayogya  
praja gen tanah Jawa  
ri kala katekan bendu  
sangking Alahu Tangala.

The asterixes refer to other changes which have been made in making the transliteration from the MS. and some of the mistakes had already been corrected by a later copyist in the MS. itself. The corrections are as follows: 3c Dipanegarane for Dipanegne, 3d Sutanegara for Suranegara, 4d tanggalira for tagalira, 5b sengkalane for sekalane, 5d Sutanegara for Suranegara,
6a Amangke for Sang marngke, 6b jinungjung for jinujung, 7e sirna for sirta, 7g sengkala for sekala, 8b mangke for mangkeng.

Translation:

>Dejected at heart  
(I) a humble beggar  
because of my great distress  
imprisoned in Semarang.  
Now gladly  
I begin the history  
of Pangeran Dipanagara.

>When he wished to raise up religion  
(and) order it throughout Java.  
This tale was begun  
to be copied down from (a document) owned  
by Mangunsubrata  
a most respected Javanese doctor  
who lives in Semarang.  

The term Mister Jawa or Dokter Jawa was a special category denoting specifically local doctors with limited medical qualifications in Java during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

>Mangunsubrata began  
to copy this tale  
of the Babad Dipanegara  
from Mas Ngabehi Sutanegara  
the honourable Patih in Semarang  
who possessed the original manuscript  
of the Serat Babad Dipanegara.

>The time when the story was begun in tembang (verse)  
to make it more enjoyable  
was on Monday Legi  
at three o'clock in the afternoon,  
the date was the twenty ninth  
of the month Rabingulakir, the year  
Alip, in the third season.

>The wuku was Julungpujut  
and the chronogram for the Javanese year was  
tata lawang ajaring wong (A.J. 1795/A.D. 1866).  
Mas Ngabehi Sutanegara  
had copied this story  
of the Raden Adipati who resides  
in Purwareja.

>He is now a Raden Adipati  
and was promoted in rank.  
The Dutch Government ordered it  
(and) the Great Lord in the Netherlands,

This again probably refers to King William I.

>because of the high moral influence  
of his father and mother  
together with the will of God.  

>Therefore till now  
the Raden Adipati is always to the fore.  
He achieved his desires  
in the year of the Prophet  
sirna tasik raningrat (A.H. 1260/A.D. 1843)  
and the chronogram for the Javanese year was

>Bumi ardi resi siji (A.J. 1771/A.D. 1843).  
Thus he (the Raden Adipati) composed the tale  
which is about Mataram,  
that is Yogyakarta,  
the mighty capital of Java,  
at the time when wrath had descended  
from God Almighty.

Again the history proper begins with the storming of the Yogyakarta Kraton in 1812.

Introduction to P.B. A.282 (Published Version):

>Kasmaran wedharin galih  

The first line of this verse gives the key that the Asmaradana metre is to be used.

>Dyan Panji Jayasupraja

Raden Tumenggung warga

Translation:
>Coming out of the great love of  
Raden Panji Jayasupraja,  
pensioned Wedana of Magetan, the son  
of Raden Tumenggung  
Jayanegara who formerly  
held the rank of Bupati  

>In Arjawinagun  
in the district of Panaraga,  
now by the will of God serving time in jail  
in the town of Semarang.  
There he came across the tale  
about the period of  
Pangeran Dipanagara,  

>When he was waging war in Java.  
The person who recounted the story  
(and) the whole history  
was Raden Ali Basah  
Kerta Pengalasan,  
formerly an official  
of Pangeran Dipanagara.  

>Then it was composed in verse  
making use of the Macapat metre  
so that those who read it would find enjoyment.  
If there are any faults in the tale  
I beg your forgiveness  
because the composer of this poetry  
is still young (and) did not experience (the events) himself.

>The time when the poem was begun  
(and) the pleasant qualities of the tale improved  
was on Monday Legi at the hour  
of three o'clock in the afternoon, on the date  
the twenty-ninth, in the month  
Rabinulakir, in the year  
Alip, in the third season.  

>The wuku was Julunpujut  
(and) the chronogram for the Javanese year  
was tata lawang ajaring wong (A.J. 1795/A.D. 1866).

>The tale begins with  
the state of Yogyakarta  
after  
His Highness the Sultan was exiled.

Again the history proper begins with the exile of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II and the appointment of his son, Dipanagara's father, as Sultan Hamegkubuwana III (1812-1814).

Thus the introduction to LOr. 2163 shows clearly that the Buku Kedhung Kebo was not the work of Raden Adipati Cakranagara I, but that rather it was written under his patronage and direction: hence the Javanese 'anggalih ayasa babad' which suggests that he was the person who conceived the outline of Babad rather than actually composed it himself. It is also interesting that Cakranagara indicated a particular time span in his career: from when he followed his commander, Pangeran Kusumayuda, out of Surakarta with troops to Bagelen and Banyumas in August 1825, until the final departure of Kusumayuda from Bagelen in January 1829 (LOr 2163 16.20 p. 203 mentions the date of Resadiwiria's departure from Surakarta as 8 Muharram, Wawu, A.J. 1753 (23 Aug. 1825) and 41.17-18, p. 506 gives 29 Jumadilakir Ehe, A.J. 1756 (6 Jan. 1829) as the date of his new appointment.) and the period when Cakranagara (then Cakrajaya) was given full command of the Javanese troops in Bagelen under the direction of Colonel Cleerens, the Dutch commander in the area. This seems to indicate specifically the part of the Buku that was of interest to Cakranagara and was important for his family history. The earlier passages in the Buku Kedhung Kebo which concern the history of Yogyakarta and of Pangeran Dipanagara in particular could thus have been written under the direction of another man.

The dates which are given in this introduction are very perplexing as Roorda himself pointed out in the notes to his translation. (Roorda op. cit. pp. 198-9) For the chronogram of the Javanese year the author only gives three figures, catur ing syaraning ratu (four are the voices of the king), which could give 174, and if this is understood as A.J. 1774/A.D. 1845, then this would not fit with the year Alip. If however A.J. 1771/A.D. 1843 is taken, which was an Alip year, then the date which is given, 1 Jumadilawal, would have fallen on a Friday and not a Wednesday as mentioned in the MS. A note by the translator who translated the MS. into Malay on the orders of Cakranagara I states that the Babad was begun in the year Jimakir on Thursday 12 Sawal, A.J. 1770, the 14th November 1842, and if the chronogram which is given in the introduc- tion to KITLV Or. 13 is taken as date for when the MS. was completed, Bumi ardi resi sii, A.J. 1771/A.D. 1843, then it can perhaps be safely assumed that the Babad was written between 1842 and 1843. This might also be supported by the two other chronograms given, tataning netra awarna, for the Hijrah year and pandhita wikuning condra for the Javanese year which could give A.D. 1843. The date which is given for Cakranagara's official appointment as Bupati of Purwareja, A.H. 1250/A.D. 1834, is however clearly false as he was confirmed as Bupati four years earlier on the 9th June 1830. (de Klerck op. cit. Vol. VI p. 198) Throughout the Buku Kedhung Kebo, and especially in the latter part of the Babad, the dates and . chronograms which are given for events are almost without exception wrong, sometimes by as much as a year, and this detracts from its usefulness as an historical source. Thus the confusion over the dating of the Buku Kedhun Keebo in the introduction is in context with the rest of the work: rightly the author referred to his own stupidity in such chronological matters when he wrote, 'rehning bodho pujanggane' (because of the stupidity of the poet), and he might perhaps have carried his modesty a stage further and refrained from calling himself a 'pujangga'. J.F.C. Gericke and T. Roorda, Javaansch-Nederduitsch Handwoordenboek, Amsterdam 1886, p.803 give the following description of the word: "A learned man, a linguist and a poet, hence pujanganing praja, a court poet, a literary man and an historian at the court who fulfilled the office of state historian."

The Koninklijk Instituut Babad and the published version however both agree on the date when the copy was made in Semarang, 29 Jumadilakir A.J. 1795, which converts into 7th November 1866, but whereas in the Koninklijk Instituut version this scribe remains anonymous, in the published version he is named as Raden Panji Jayasupraja, a pensioned Wedana from Magetan in East Java and a son of a previous Bupati of Panaraga. (de Klerck op. cit. Vol. VI, List of eastern Mancanagara Bupatis, p. 375.) This man was apparently imprisoned in Semaran jail for some unknown offence against the Government, and there met Ali Basah Kerta Pengalasan who recounted the history orally. It is known that Penalasan went to Semarang after the end of the Java War, and was apparently still living there in March 1856, (Hageman Joz., Geschiedenis van den Oorlog op Java van 1825 tot 1830, Batavia 1856, pp. 412-3.) but there is no evidence to suggest that he served any time in prison or was connected with the prison service. Certainly by the time Raden Panji Jayasupraja came to copy down the Babad in Semarang in 1866 Pengalasan must have already been a very old man because he was already referred to as 'Bapak Pengalasan' in Colonel Cleerens' reports from the Bagelen front in 1829-1830. (de Kock Private Archive, ARA, (henceforth DK) No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock, 14 Nov. 1829, letter No. 232.) It seems likely that the Babad version in question was written many years before; thus the Koninklijk Instituut MS. states that the original document, or babon, was in the hands of Mas Ngabehi Sutanegara, the Patih of Semarang (Regeerings Almanak 1866, p. 205.) who had himself copied it, almost certainly from the complete Buku Kedhung Kebo MS. made earlier under the sponsorship of Cakranagara I. One of Cakranagara's sons may have got a position in a Government office in Semarang (Interview with Bapak Wiriaratmaka, ex Bupati of Purwareja 1966-1967, Purwareja, May 1972.) before succeeding his father as Bupati of Purwareja in 1862, and it is likely that Mas Ngabehi Sutanegara would have known this man although it is not entirely certain. It would seem appropriate that if Cakranagara's son had recently succeeded his father as Bupati of Purwareja, he would have been anxious to have the Buku copied again as a reaffirmation of the rights of the Cakranagara dynasty in Bagelen. It may be also that earlier Cakranagara's son, Mas Ngabehi Sutanegara and Pengalasan had co-operated together on the composition of some parts of the Buku in Semarang on the instructions of Cakranagara I, which would explain the influence of Semarang Malay and Javanese idioms in the Buku.

Cakranagara's son would also have had his own experiences of fighting in Bagelen during the Java War, although he would still have been very young. (LOr 2163 34.72 p. 454.) This however remains very tentative and some under- standing of the biographies of both Raden Adipati Cakranagara I and Ali Basah Pengalasan seems necessary first to clarify the background to the composition of the Buku.

## c. Biography of Cakranagara

Cakranagara seems to have been born in Bagelen some time around 1780, (Not.KBG. 5 Apr. 1862 pp. 508-510 quoting a letter of A. W. Kinder de Camarecq, Resident of Bagelen (1854-1862), dated 20 Mar. 1862, which mentioned that the eighty year old Regent was busy (onledig heeft gehouden) in former years with the composition of a Babad on the Java War. Cakranagara died in 1862 (date on the tombstone of Cakranagara's grave at Bulus, Loano).) which would thus have made him an almost direct contemporary of Pangeran Dipanagara who was born in Yogyakarta on November 11th 1785. (LOr 6547 b, 14.44 p. 114, which gives 8 Muharram A.J. 1712 (11 Nov. 1785); see also Louw op. cit. Vol. I p. 89.) He came from a family of prominent Kyais in Bagelen, which had been administered by Surakarta as a western Mancanagara province since the Treaty of Giyanti in 1755. Cakranagara himself had been born in the desa (village) of Banyuurip between the Lereng and Bagawanta rivers in south-eastern Bagelen, but members of his family had established themselves in various villages around the area and had served as officials of both Kartasura and Surakarta for five generations. (Sëdjarah R. Af. T. Suranëgara (Family tree of the descendants of the Cakranagara family now living in Purwarëja).) One of the positions held by their family had been that of Mantri Gladhag, which amongst other duties entailed the organisation of transport labour for the Sunan. See Gericke & Roorda op. cit. p. 1000. The Gladhag was a sort of porter's guild organised in both Yogyakarta and Surakarta for carrying loads on the roads of Central Java; much of the labour was drawn from the Mancanagara provinces, hence Cakranagara's family probably organised the supply of transport labour from Bagelen which was partly administered by Surakarta at that time. The labourers were poorly paid and often feil a prey to opium and gambling, see J. I. van Sevenhoven, Aanteekeningen gehouden op eene reis over Java van Batavia naar de Oosthoek in 1812, KITLV H 503, pp. 49-52. The position was a humble one, but it served nevertheless as a useful channel for Kraton patronage. Later when the Cakranagara family tree was drawn up in 1939 their lineage was traced back as far as Majapahit. (Soedjarah Raden Adipati Tjokronagoro I - Poerworedjo - soho garwo putro, Bandoeng, October 1939.) Cakranagara appears to have succeeded to the family position of Mantri Gladhag in Surakarta, and served there in the Kraton administration under the name of Nabehi Resadiwiria. (Wiriaratmaka, Vreede op. cit. p. 141, Kinder de Camarecq op. cit. pp. 508-10.) Very little is known about his career before the outbreak of the Java War in 1825, but there is a story that both Cakranagara and Dipanagara studied Islamic mysticism and kebatinan (Javanese spiritual disciplines) under the same guru together in a village just outside Surakarta. (Interview with Ibu Dr. Sahir, great-granddaughter of P. Dipanagara II, Yogyakarta, May 1972.)

To avoid complication the name of Cakranagara will be used throughout this article. In fact as is usual in Java, he bore various names during his career: a childhood name which is unknown, Mas Nabehi Resadiwiria during his period at Surakarta, Tumenggun Resadiwiria during the early part of the fighting in Bagelen, Tumenggung Cakrajaya from 1828-1830, Kyai Adipati Cakrajaya from 1830-1832, and finally Raden Adipati Cakranagara from 1832 until his death in 1862. The name Cakrajaya recalls that of the local wali of Bagelen Sunan Geseng from whom Cakranagara was supposedly descended, see Dr. D. A. Rinkes, De Heiligen van Java III: Sunan Geseng, TBG, LIII, 1911, p. 284.

This guru was not however Kyai Maja whose family had a wide following at both courts of central Java, but whom Dipanagara met only briefly before the Java War. (de Klerck op. cit. Vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI, pp. 744-5.) It is more likely to have been a Kyai of foreign descent, known as Kyai Taptajani, who was born an inhabitant of Melangi, a village near Yogyakarta, a short distance to the north-west of Dipanagara's dalem at Tegalreja. The details on Kyai Taptajani are taken from a letter of M. Waterloo to N. Engelhard (Gov. of Java's N.E. Coast 1801-1808) dated 22nd June 1805, in Bundel Djokjo Brieven, No. 49, AN. Taptajani is the Javanese pronunciation of the Arabic name Taftazani; Al-Taftazani was a famous scholar who wrote books on many subjects that have been in use for centuries after his death in ? A.D. 1390. It is possible that Taptajani might have been a Sumatran who after the Indonesian practice when assuming an Arab name, had assumed that of a famous writer (Note of Prof. G. W. J. Drewes) This village was closely associated with the Danureja family, the Patihs of Yogyakarta, with whom Dipanagara himself had close family connections. (R. W. Dwijasuganda and R. S. Adisutrisno, Serat Dherah ingih sesebutan Raden, Kediri 1941, p. 99.) According to a report written by the Resident of Yogyakarta, Matthias Waterloo (1803-1808), in 1805, Taptajani was held in high regard by the nobles of the Yogyakarta Kraton and was the guru of Patih Danureja II (1799-1811). He had learnt to speak fluent Javanese and had a reputation for being extremely well read in Islamic law. His two sons had however been sent away to Surakarta, which seems to have been more important at that time as a spiritual centre than Yogyakarta. There they found positions under the patronage of Pageran Buminata at the Surakarta court, and were very close to the circle of gurus and teachers at Maja. In June 1805 Taptajani himself fled to Surakarta when his lands at Melangi were reseized by Danureja II and after the Pengulu of Yogyakarta had refused him permission to continue to meet Princes from the Yogyakarta Kraton. In Surakarta he quickly won the esteem of Sunan Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820) by translating a difficult Arabic book, the Siratu'l Mustakim, into Javanese, and was accorded a sizeable grant of land in a village one hour's distance to the west of Surakarta. Letter of M. Waterloo to N. Engelhard cit. The Sirat'ul Mustakim (The straight path) is a quotation from the Fatiha (Kuran Sura 1), it most probably refers to the Sirat al Mustaqim by Nur al-Din al-Raniri, a fiqh book that stood in high repute in Indonesia (Note of Prof. G. W. J. Drewes), see Ph,. S. van Ronkel, Catalogus der Maleische Handschriften in het Museum van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van kunsten en wetenschappen, VBG, LVII, 1909, pp. 375-377. He apparently had plans to go to Mecca so that he could live in peace without being bound to either court, but he stayed in the Surakarta area where he continued to have an important influence on Pakubuwana IV and Surakarta court circles. (Ibid., letter of Waterloo to Engelhard.) The Surakarta Kraton Babad written in 1825, which concerns the outbreak of the Java War, has a passage in which Kyai Taptajani is described as coming at night to Tegalreja at the head of all the Ulamas from the independent areas (pardikan), Ketibs, Modins and experts in Islamic law, and as having given Dipanagara advice as to the right moment for the Ratu Adil to proclaim himself and the Holy War (Pre Sabil) to be waged. (LOr 2114 4.29, 5 1-15 (pp. 15-17).) It seems highly likely that Dipanagara had close connections with him as Taptajani must have been at the height of his influence in Yogyakarta when Dipanagara was living with his great-grandmother at Tegalreja and studying Islam as a young man. There is evidence in Dipanagara's own autobiographical Babad that Taptajani was the guru of his younger brother, Pangeran Adisuria, a man of great spiritual strength who died a 'moksa' death on Mt. Sirnabaya in Bagelen at the end of the Java War, and from this passage it appears that Taptajani had died some time before. LOr 6547, d 38. 44-46 p. 209, Rusche op. cit. Vol. II p. 138. A 'moksa' death (Jav. muksa) is a death when no mortal remains are left behind.

It would thus seem possible that through Kyai Taptajani, Cakranagara and Dipanagara could have met before the outbreak of the war and may have even had close relations, for nothing unites two people more in Java than having studied at the feet of the same guru kebatinan together. Indeed in the Buku Kedhun Kebo itself there is implicit in the wayang imagery used a suggestion that as far as Cakranagara was concerned the War itself was a trial of kesaktian (spiritual strength) between himself and Pangeran Dipanagara, for he portrays himself in the Buku as Raden Setyaki or Bimakunting and Pangeran Dipanagara as a Kurawa leader, probably Suyudana, and this imagery is featured on the leather bindings of two MS. copies of the Buku. LOr 2163 has (back cover) Suyudana (with a pike) and Baladewa, and (front cover) Durna and Bima (with a club). DevAth DvT V I has (front cover) Bima and Yudistira and (back cover) Suyudana and Baladewa, see Pigeaud op. cit. Vol. II p. 869. In the Mahabharata, the war between the Kurawas and the Pandhawas, Bima is portrayed as eventually triumphing over Suyudana despite the latter's kesaktian because of being informed by Prabu Kresna of a weak place on Suyudana's left thigh. (Pak Hardjowirogo, Sedjarah Wajang Purwa, Balai Pustaka, 1965, p. 96) This undercurrent of the struggle between the individual kesaktian of different men and the wayang imagery of the Bratayuda may have played an important part in the consciousness of those Javanese who took part in the Java War. It is expressed in another way too in the Buku Kedhun Kebo in the important descriptions of signs and portents delivered through dreams and visions to Pangeran Dipanagara's abdi dalem (retainers) before the outbreak of the Java War, which foretold that Dipanagara would rule in Java and spread Islam, but that this authority would be taken from him if he proved guilty of pride, recklessness or conceit. See G. Forrester, The Java war: some Javanese Aspects, unpublished M.A. Thesis, Australian National University, Canberra, 1971, Chapter III, entitled 'Signs and Portents: their role in the Babad', pp. 43-73, which was based on an analysis of KITLV Or. 13 Cantos 6-7. The fact that Dipanagara eventually failed in his endeavours was thus ascribed obliquely by the author of the Buku to a fatal flaw in Dipanagara's character and spiritual integrity.

This evidence as to Cakranagara's relationship with Dipanagara still remains tentative however, and it is almost certain that it was not renewed in a direct confrontation during the Java War itself, for when the war broke out in July 1825 he was still in Surakarta, and when General de Kock asked Sunan Pakubuwana VI (1823-1830) to send troops to the Banyumas and Bagelen areas in August 1825, Cakranagara was sent as the personal adviser of the Surakarta army commander Kusumayuda. (Vreede op. cit. p. 141, and Kinder de Camarecq op. cit. ) His task was apparently to point out the footpaths and roads in the Bagelen area for the Dutch officers and their Javanese allies, and to organise local resistance by making use of his own numerous family connections in the area against the growing strength of Dipanagara's troops there. During the course of the war Cakranagara seems to have made himself agreeable to the Dutch army officers in the area, especially to the commander in Bagelen, Colonel Cleerens, with whom he spoke Malay. (See LOr 2163 36.26 p. 460, and DK, No. 49 letters of Cleerens to de Kock.) He seems to have been impressed by Dutch ways, and even mentions with pride in the Buku that he was portrayed by Cleerens as a Dutchman on the presentation of a decoration. (LOr 2163 44.68 p. 532.) Perhaps his choice of the white skinned Pandhawa army commander, Raden Seta, as a wayang figure with which to identify in some battle scenes also had a symbolic value in this context. (LOr 2163 33.47 p. 425 and for a description of Raden Seta, Hardjowirogo op. cit. pp. 69-70.) In this respect he was in marked contrast to Dipanagara who hated to hear Malay spoken and despised Dutch ways, (2nd Lt. Knoerle, Notes made during a journey from Batavia to Menado with Dipanagara, Van den Bosch Private Archive, ARA, No. 391 p. 41 which quoted Dipanagara as saying that: 'The Malay language is the language of chickens and no ruler in Java wished to hear it.' For details on Dipanagara's attitude towards Dutch ways see LOr 6547 b 18.131, Rusche op. cit. I p. 80.) and also even to his own immediate superior Pangeran Kusumayuda who was viewed by the Dutch High Command as being too much attached to Surakarta Kraton circles to be really useful as an ally. (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock, 8 Dec. 1828, No. 65.)

Cakranagara thus saw action exclusively in the areas of Bagelen and Banyumas and showed great zeal in military engagements. In December 1828 he was appointed Bupati of Tangung with the name of Tumenggung Cakrajaya when he captured Basah Purwanegara and eight of his bodyguard almost single-handed. (de Klerck op. cit. Vol. IV p. 711 ff.) He was also given the administration of the Surakarta lands in Bagelen to the east of the rivers Jali, Lesung and Bagawanta and to the south of the Lerang, thus the area close to his own birthplace in which his family influence was strongest. Then in September 1829 troops operating under his command were responsible for the death of Pangeran Dipanagara's most respected army commander, Pangeran Ngabehi (earlier Pageran Jayakusuma) and his two sons at Sangon in the Kelir Mts, on the borders of Bagelen and Kulon Praga. (Ibid. Vol. V pp. 393-5.) This incident in which a prominent member of the Mataram Royal House met his death at the hands of a descendant of local Kyais naturally established Cakranagara's reputation in the area, (Kinder de Camarecq op. cit.) but Cakranagara himself seems to have been disturbed by this deed in which he was responsible for the death of a close relation of his own commander Pangeran Kusumayuda. (LOr 2163 46. 11-18, pp. 563-5.) He adopted an ambivalent attitude towards his superiors in the Surakarta Kraton, on the one hand he used pusakas (sacred heirlooms) given to him by Kusumayuda in the fighting, but on the other hand he made no active attempt to support his commander when he was removed by the Dutch in January 1829. This equivocation served him well and he himself was appointed as Kusumayuda's successor with control over all the Surakarta troops and officials in Bagelen. (LOr 2163 41. 17-26, p. 506.)

General de Kock seems to have promised Pangeran Kusumayuda on his retirement that he would be allowed to administer Bagelen at the end of the war, (Kinder de Camarecq op. cit.) but this promise was broken shortly after Dipanagara was taken prisoner at Magelang in March 1830. Cakranagara was summoned there by de Kock along with other officials from Bagelen and was informed that the province would be made a Dutch Residency. He then accompanied de Kock to Surakarta to report the news to Sunan Pakubuwana VI and Pangeran Kusumayuda, but was unable to obtain an interview with the Sunan. (LOr 2163 46. 22-39 (pp. 576-9), and 47. 1-16 (pp. 579-580).) He returned to Bagelen with the Dutch Commissioner for the western Mancanagara lands, van Sevenhoven, and was eventually sworn in as Bupati of Purwareja on the 9th June 1830 by the first head Pengulu of Bagelen after the Java War, Haji Badarrudin, a former supporter of Pameran Dipanagara. (de Klerck op. cit. Vol. VI p. 196 ff.) The failure to return Bagelen and other Mancanagara lands to Surakarta at the end of the war caused much bitterness in Surakarta, and was partly responsible for the events which led up to the exile of Sunan Pakubuwana VI in June 1830. Another Surakarta Tumenggung with family connections in Bagelen, Arun Binan, was also appointed, but it was Cakranagara himself whose family attained the most influence in the area. (Soedjarah Raden Adipati Tjokronagoro I op. cit. gives a list of Cakranagara's wives which illustrate the extent of his connections: Nyai Adip. Cakranagara (Pengasih), R.Nt. Cakranagara (Rebug, Kemiri), M.Aj. Tanggung (Cangkrep), M.Aj. Dasih (Kali Gesing), M.Aj. Sarimpi (Tangung), M.Aj. Mintarsih (Banyuurip), M.Aj. Wolo, (Pekacangan, Pituruh).) The Kabupaten which was built in Purwareja in about 1838 was constructed on the lines of a Kraton with an extensive northern alun-alun and a large Pendapa. Cakranagara's connections with Surakarta were still maintained, (His grandson served as Mantri Gladhag at Surakarta in the 1860s, Kinder . de Camarecq op. cit.) but it was above all as a friend of the Dutch that Cakranagara had won his position and thus Dutch officials, especially military men, were often entertained in Dutch fashion in the Purwareja Kabupaten. (For descriptions see LOr 2163 pp. 585-623, and DevAth DvT V I Cantos 60-75.) Cakranagara's diary which was presented to the commander of the Dutch army, Duke Bernhard of Sachsen Weimar (1850-1854), gives a fascinating insight into the relations between the Bupati and the Dutch civil and military officials in which vulgar 'Bazaar' Malay was used in conversation. (This is a MS. now in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek, Berl. S.B. Or. folio 568, which will be described by Dr. Pigeaud in a forthcoming book on Javanese MSS. in W. German collections.)

The career of Cakranagara is probably similar to that of many other 'new men' who were appointed as Bupatis after the Java War by the Dutch Government, for often these were men who had much local influence but yet did not belong to the Yogyakarta or Surakarta high nobility. The style was also new with its stress on Malay rather than Javanese and its copying of Dutch ways; as such the period of the Java War marked a watershed in social change amongst the administrative personnel of the Central Javanese provinces and in this context the example of Cakranagara and the historical materials concerning him are important. As far as the Buku itself is concerned it is difficult to judge exactly how large a part Cakranagara played in its composition. Although it certainly seems that much of the latter half of the Buku which concerns the fighting in Bagelen and the history of Purwareja after the Java War was due to him, there still remains the question as to how so much of the history of Yogyakarta before the war could have been described by Cakranagara as a Surakarta official. Moreover there are detailed accounts of the fighting around Yogyakarta and Selarong in the early months of the war in the early part of the Buku, and many of these accounts equate almost exactly with certain Dutch military dispatches and Pangeran Dipanagara's own account of the fighting in his autobiographical Babad. (See in particular the description of the capture and release of R. M. Suwangsa, cavalry captain of the Mankunegaran Legion, July 28-31 1825, in KITLV Or. 13 12. 21-28 pp. 128-129, and LOr 6547 b 22. 65-68 p. 390, Rusche op. cit. I p. 140, and the Dutch military dispatch drafted by the above in DK No. 183, dated 7 Aug. 1825, a part of which was published in H. F. Aukes, Het Legioen van Mangkoe Nagoro, Bandoeng 1935, Nix & Co, pp. 79-81.)

During the early months of the war Cakranagara remained in Surakarta and when he was eventually posted to the front with Paperan Kusumayuda, he experienced none of the fighting in the Yogyakarta area, but was sent straight to the west, to Bagelen and Banyumas. It seems far more likely that for these early passages in the Buku Ali Basah Pengalasan and not Cakranagara provided the main information, and this is confirmed by Pengalasan's own career.

d. Biography of Pengalasan
Pengalasan is referred to in a Dutch report during the Java War as having previously been a Demang in the village of Tanjung (Kulon Progo) and as having had the name Kramawijaya; (DK, No. 148, List of Princes and the most important leaders with the rebels, rough draft prepared by Walraven van Nes (Res. of Yogya 1827-1830) on 4 Oct. 1829. Tanjung was placed as a village just to the south of Nanggulan (Kulon Progo) in de Klerck op. cit. Vol. V, Map.) another report mentions that he served in Wates in the Kulon Progo area. (DK No. 158, Lijst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen (List of persons who have risen as rebels), in which Pengalasan is mentioned as No. 23 under Newly appointed Regents (i.e. appointed by Dipanagara between 1825-1830). His name Pengalasan, which was used in the Majapahit period to denote a Kraton retainer or abdi dalem, (Note of Dr. Pigeaud.) suggests however that he might have fulfilled some official function in the Yogyakarta Kraton. He is mentioned by Col. Cleerens in 1829 as being married to the family of Pangeran Blitar, (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Koek 26 Sept. 1829.) and this Pangeran was one of the first to rally to Dipanagara at Selarong on the 29th July 1825 and was particularly discontented because of the loss of revenue from the abolition of the land rent. (DK No. 111, Over het karakter van den Soesoehoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de Prinsen en rijksgrooten .. . Nov.-Dec. 1829.) In Dipanagara's own Babad Pengalasan is mentioned as a Raden, which suggests that he was not of particularly high birth. (LOr 6547 c 33.156, Rusche op. cit. Vol. I p. 268, Hageman op. cit. p. 82 mentioned him as a grandson of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II (1792-1810/1826-1828) but he was probably a more distant relation.) He may have even had a position in the entourage of the Pengulu of Yogyakarta, Kamalodininrat, who was appointed on the instructions of Patih Danureja IV and the Ratu Ageng in 1823 much to the annoyance of Pangeran Dipanagara, but it is unclear. (KITLV H.76, List of rebel Princes, Bupatis and Mantris, in Papieren, (Javaansche): Boedel van Sultan Hamengkoe Buwana IV (1814-1822), a certain Tum. Kertawijaya is mentioned in the following of Pengulu Kamalodiningrat, and as Pengalasan was known as Kerta Pengalasan and Kramawijaya, there may be some connection with the inversion of names. The wealth of details in the early part of the Buku which concern the religious hierarchy in Yogyakarta before the Java War does seem to suggest, however, that the author had some intimate knowledge of this group. The Yogyakarta Kraton Babad mentions that Pengalasan rallied to Dipanagara along with other officials and persons of royal blood from the Yogyakarta Kraton when the Pangeran was still at Tegalreja, (Kraton Yogya Babad A. 62 p. 130.) and he was certainly at Selarong later in the month as he is referred to in three separate Babad accounts as receiving a command there. (KITLV Or 13 10.24, SB 136 52.9 (p. 227), LOr 6547 c 23.205 (Rusche op. cit. Vol. I p. 160).)

Roorda noted in his introduction to his translation of the early part of the Buku that the author seemed to have been closely acquainted with what had happened at Yogyakarta before the outbreak of the Java War and even what had been spoken about there. (Roorda op. cit. p. 138.) Indeed there are many details about the happenings in Yogyakarta which are not in other Babad accounts, in particular the detailed descriptions of the attendance of religious figures at the two state funerals of Sultan Hamengkubuwana III in November 1814 and of Sultan Hamengkubuwana IV in December 1822, (KITLV Or 13 2.10-17 (for a description of ceremonies on the death of HB III) and KITLV Or 13 3. 43-44 (for a description of ceremonies on the death of HB IV).) and Dipanagara's own relations with the Yogyakarta religious hierarchy are discussed in detail. The early part of the Buku also gives a unique insight into Dipanagara's character, his circle at Tegalreja, his relations with the Yogyakarta Kraton, his asceticism and reading habits: it gives above all a sympathetic picture of the Pangeran in which his stern religious piety is especially admired; it is the picture of a warm supporter rather than an adversary. The events which led up to the outbreak of the war are also chronicled in great detail, which suggests a first-hand knowledge of these events by the author himself. It seems likely that if Pengalasan did fulfil some official function in Yogyakarta especially if it had a connection with religious groups, then he would have been in a position to chronicle the events of those years in Yogyakarta with accuracy. Certainly Dipanagara himself had a large following amongst just such junior officials, for one Dutch report mentions that 78 Demangs from the Sultan's lands in Mataram rallied to the Paneran during the early years of the war. (KITLV H 76.)

Pengalasan played an important role in the defence of Selarong during the summer months of 1825, (LOr 6547 c. 23.160 and 23.205 (Rusche op. cit. Vol. I p. 157 and p. 160).) and together with Tumenggun Jayasundarga he was operating around Yogyakarta at the time when an officer of the Mangkunagaran Legion, R. M. Suwansa, was captured, an event which is described in great detail in the Buku. (See above n. 66, and LOr 8552 a 107. 1-10 p. 522.) Later in October, when Dipanagara ordered the evacuation of Selarong, Pengalasan formed part of the rearguard and was in charge of the artillery, and together with Dipanagara the Younger and Mas Mangunagara covered one flank of Dipanagara's retreat across the Selarong hills. (LOr 6547 c 23.160 (Rusche op. cit. Vol. I p. 157).) Pengalasan then rallied to Dipanagara together with Pangeran Ngabehi (Jayakusuma) when the Pangeran was at his first army headquarters to the west of Praga at Banyumeneng, (Ibid., c 24.66 (Rusche op. cit. Vol. I p. 170).) and later fought alongside Kyai Maja and other military commanders during the defence of Deksa in November 1825. (Kraton Yogya MS. A.62 p. 450.) After this engagement during the reorganisation of Dipanagara's army commands at Deksa, Pengalasan was appointed an Ali Basah with the name of Ngabdullatip, possibly in remembrance of a Haji of the Pesantren of Kasonan who had been killed in the fighting at Kemban Gedhe near Banyumeneng in November. (LOr 6547 c 24.9 p. 42 (Rusche op. cit. I p. 165).) He was given command of all Dipanagara's troops to the west of Praga with all the Tumenggungs under his command and two Hajis as supporters. (LOr 6547 c 24 97-98 p. 56.) In the following year he played an important role in the defence of Dipanagara's benteng at Plered (May-June 1826), and is mentioned as a close associate of Kyai Maja and of Maja's younger brother Hasan Besari, the Tumenggung of Pajang. (SB 136 p. 297 45.24.) He was severely wounded when Plered was overrun in June 1826 by the Dutch forces, and was taken by Haji Ngisa, a close


associate, to recuperate at Selarong; (LOr 6547 c 25. 16-17 p.78 and a translation of the same passage given in Aukes op. cit. p. 158.) later in the same year he was called up at Pangeran Dipanagara's express command to take part in his abortive attack on Surakarta. (LOr 6547 c 26 23-4 p. 158.) In 1827 Pengalasan saw action around Barabadur together with Pangeran Mankudiningrat, (R. T. Jayadininrat, Schetsen over den Oorlog van Java, ML 97 (Museum Pusat), p. 93.) but soon after seems to have been sent to Bagelen as the guardian of Pangeran Dipaagara the Younger, and was again accorded command of all the troops on the west bank of the Praga together with various other religious leaders. In particular he was placed in command of the Jayengan Regiment which had a uniform of a red turban and a white jacket and had special duties as a lifeguard of priests for Dipanagara. (LOr 6547 c 28 89-91 pp. 252-3 (Rusche op. cit. Vol. I pp. 271-2), SB 25 42-3 (p. 105). Dipanagara's regiments are described in A. S. H. Booms, Eenige bladzijden uit de Nederlands Indische krijgsgeschiedenis 1820-1840, uit de "memoires" van F. C. Gilly de Montela, Amsterdam 1911, p. 34.) During the latter years of the war Pengalasan operated almost exclusively in Bagelen and was referred to by Col. Cleerens as one of the most important rebel army commanders in the area. (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock letter No. 210, 26 Sept. 1825.) He remained close to Dipanagara and is mentioned as one of the few Basahs (army- commanders) who remained with the Pangeran after the disastrous defeats of September 1829. On September 25th 1829 he sent a letter to a kinsman, Tumenggung Cakrareja, expressing his willingness to come over to the Dutch, (Ibid. -) and this initiative was encouraged by Col. Cleerens. Pengalasan eventually gave himself up to Cakranagara at the Benteng of Bubutan (Bagelen) on November 11th and was presented to Cleerens three days later at Kedhung Kebo, (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock, No. 249, 24 Dec. 1829.) but there is the suspicion that his submission had an ulterior motive and that he had been dispatched by Dipanagara himself to open peace negotiations for him.

Cleerens mentions that he was invited often to dine at his headquarters and that he was treated more as a personal friend than a captive (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock letters Nos 235, 236, and 240, 19 Nov., 20 Nov. and 3 Dec. 1829.): his predilection for wine and opium was remarked on and more importantly his interest in Turkish affairs. (Ibid., Cleerens to de Kock 3 Jan. 1830 No. 253.) He appears to have been keen to ingratiate himself with the Dutch High Command by organising the peace negotiations with Dipanagara, and hoped that by his efforts he would secure himself a post and a salary from the Dutch; he was particularly jealous of Sentot in this respect because of the latter's favoured position with the Government. Pengalasan thus wrote twice to Dipanagara's Patih, Danureja, to contact Dipanagara and wrote a full-length letter to Cleerens in which he laid out his own views about Dipanagara's peace proposals.(These letters are published in Dutch translation in E. S. de Klerck op.cit. Vol. V, Bijlage XXV a-b. For Pengalasan's letter to Cleerens see appendix.) These literary endeavours were also remarked on by Cleerens to de Kock in a letter in which he mentioned that: 'He (Pengalasan) writes much for a Javanese and puts himself across well or so I hear ...'. (DK No. 49, Cleerens to de Kock, 7 Dec. 1829, No. 242.) His letter to Cleerens however brought him under great suspicion as a possible emissary of Dipanagara; 'I think more and more that Pengalasan is the man that D.N. has sent over to negotiate with us,' wrote Cleerens, and at another point he warned de Kock not to place any trust in either Danureja or Pengalasan: 'Your Excellency must order them accordingly for neither of them are sincere . . '. (Ibid., Cleerens to de Kock, 28 Mar. 1830, No. 271.) Thus although Pengalasan played an important role in organising Cleerens' meeting with Dipanagara at Rema Kamal on the borders of Banyumas and Bagelen on the 16th February 1830, in which Cleerens remarked on Pengalasan's great influence over Dipanagara, (DK No. 209, Letter of Cleerens to Col. Cochius, 26 Feb. 1830.) he received no reward from the Dutch Government after the end of the Magelang Conference in March. Instead it seems likely that he accompanied Dipanagara to Semarang and remained there fulfilling some minor office for the rest of his life. Hageman mentioned that he was still living there in March 1856 when he came to write his book on the Java War. (Hageman op. cit. pp. 412-3.)
Pengalasan's career gives the impression that he would have been in a position to give first hand information as to the history of Yogyakarta before the Java War and to military engagements in the Yogyakarta area about which Cakranagara could have had no knowledge. His close connection with Dipanagara and members of his family throughout the course of the War would also have meant that he was in a unique position to provide personal details about the Pangeran which Cakranagara may not have known. His connection with many of the most important religious leaders in Dipanagara's entourage during the Java War is interesting too, considering the very positive attitude towards Dipanagara's religious piety which is expressed in the early part of the Buku. Pengalasan could not have been called a literary man, certainly not a pujanga, but the fact that he could write is an important consideration when judging his possible contribution to the composition of the Buku. It seems likely however that both Cakranagara and Pengalasan merely dictated the general outlines and details, and that the various parts of the Buku Kedhun Kebo were then written down in tembang (verse), hence the references to 'mangun langening carita' by the scribes in the introductory verses. Dipanagara also seems to have used the same technique when he came to write his own Babads in Menado and Makassar.

## e. Conclusion
Any conclusions about the authorship of the Buku must remain tentative in view of the lack of really firm information as to the stages of its composition. Nevertheless it seems likely that Pengalasan provided much of the material for the first part of the Buku, roughly the first 200 pages which Roorda translated, although Cakranagara's possible kebatinan contact with Dipanagara may have been helpful in this respect. Thus the long passages concerning the signs and portents received by Dipanagara before the Java War could have been written by either Pengalasan or Cakranagara, for they would conveniently explain either why Pengalasan deserted the Pangeran, or else why, despite Dipanagara's great spiritual accomplishments, Cakranagara decided to fight against him. Then, after the brief interlude in which the fighting in East Java and around Demak is described during the early months of the war, the rest of the Buku which concerns the fighting in Bagelen and the history of Purwareja after the Java War seems to have been almost certainly the work of Cakranagara. There is a clear divide in the tone of the work between the first and the second parts of the Buku and it is expressed most specifically in the attitude towards Dipanagara and towards Islam. Pengalasan may have continued however to play an advisory role in the composition of the latter part of the Buku for he would have been in a position to provide details about Dipanagara's troops in Bagelen and other areas. In particular his close acquaintance with Kyai Maja may have been important in providing the unique details of Kyai Maja's break with Dipanagara and his subsequent capture.
As an historical source the Buku is easier to evaluate; it must stand as a foremost Javanese source for the history of the Java War and a comparative account of great value to set beside Dipanagara's own autobiographical account and the Kraton Babads. The fact that it was composed under the auspices of two men who played such different roles and had such dissimilar careers serves to enhance its importance: it is at the same time the work of one of Dipanagara's closest army commanders and religious advisers, and of a formidable adversary. The fact that many of the military engagements described in the Buku concur closely with Dutch Military dispatches is also important, although this does not necessarily mean that either Cakranagara or Pengalasan had access to Dutch sources: many events described by Dipanagara in his own Babad concur with these dispatches and he certainly had no access to them. The account which it gives of Yogyakarta and of Pangeran Dipanagara before the Java War is unrivalled by other Javanese sources, and the latter part of the Buku provides much information about Bagelen which can be readily checked against available Dutch sources. The most important Dutch source for events in Bagelen during these years is that quoted above, DK No. 49, which contains all Col. Cleerens' letters to de Kock between 10 Oct. 1825-8 April 1830. The dates which are given do however detract much from its usefulness as an historical source. Moreover as a piece of literature it is not fine and at worst degenerates into straightforward 'Bazaar' Malay: as such it can best be seen as a social document to illustrate the career of the man who conceived the work, Raden Adipati Cakranagara I of Purwareja. Acknowledgements and thanks are due to Dr. Pigeaud who provided many useful suggestions and checked all the Javanese translations. Also to Prof. Zoetmulder S.J. and Drs. Mujanattistomo of Yogyakarta who both helped with the interpretation of the Javanese introductions. Finally many thanks must go to the Bupati of Purwareja and his staff who made many documents available to me and who devoted a considerable amount of their time in organising interviews in the Bagelen area.

### Letter of Ali Basah Pengalasan to Colonel Cleerens

from the de Kock Collection (ARA) folio No. 210

The following letter from Ali Basah Pengalasan to Col. Cleerens is included for two reasons, firstly because it gives some impression of Pengalasan's degree of literacy which is important when judging his contribution to the Buku Kedhung Kebo, and secondly because the letter itself is of great historical importance in ascertaining some of Dipanagara's possible plans for peace in Java after the Java War (1825-1830) as expressed by one of his closest army commanders.

The letter is written on four octo sized sheets of Dutch Import paper (Blauw & Bril) in black ink with a difficult sloping hand. It is not clear and sometimes hard to read. In the top left hand corner of the first page there is the seal of Ali Basah Pengalasan in Arabic script which reads: 'Pratandha Ngapdullatip Pengalasan afi'ala anhu (May God forgive him)'. In the transliteration the original punctuation and spelling have been kept but capital letters introduced for proper names and titles.

N.B. This is not a literal translation but rather a summary of the contents. Pengalasan's conversational style makes any direct translation impossible.

This letter comes with many greetings from Raden Ngabdullatip Ali Basah Pengalasan to The Honourable Colonel Cleerens. After these greetings the reason for this letter is because the Colonel asked me about the aims of the Sultan of Java. From the very beginning he wished to restore the high state of the Islamic religion throughout the whole of Java. Supposing he gave up (The Javanese 'nanggiya perangipun' seems to mean 'samanga', I give it up.) his war with the Dutch, the Sultan of Java would permit four conditions, and the Dutch are invited to choose one of them.

Firstly, if the Dutch still wish to remain as soldiers, their pay will remain unchanged, the great ones will not be changed in their positions, so as to be the sword of the religion. In the Kartasura period Javanese rulers used V.O.C. troops against seditious movements such as the Kajoran faction, 'Agama' here means not only religion ('Agami Islam') but the divine order in general.

Secondly, if the Dutch still feel at home in Java, but are willing to be in a private capacity and to trade, they will be distributed ten thousand (No specific area such as 'Cacah' is given in the Javanese.) ricefields, (and) all the various Dutch homes must be brought together in one area, that is all on the North Coast. The Pasisir could also mean Government controlled lands other than those on the North Coast.

Thirdly, if the Dutch wish to return home to The Netherlands, we will continue forever to be as brothers with each other, (and if) they want any produce from the Javanese, the Dutch must indeed pay the right price for it, or if the Dutch wish to cultivate ricefields in Java, they must rent them for the right rent.

Fourthly, if the Dutch wish to enter the true faith, their livelihood and positions will not be changed but improved.

When at any time the Tuan Besar (This refers to General H. M. de Kock who was always referred to as 'Kanjeng Tuwan Besar' in Javanese documents.) meets with the Sultan of Java, the Sultan of Java will accord him deep respect, and when the Sultan of Java talked to me, or to all his Basahs ('Basah' was the word to denote Pageran Dipanagara's army-commanders, it derived from the Turkish 'Pasha', hence also 'Ali Basah' (the "High" Pasha).) as to his glorifying the Dutch, he has a great admiration for them. He is impressed by various things, because they are truthful, brave, intrepid, quick-witted, reliable, energetic, (and) swift. They humble themselves (but) their spirits are noble; they are generous with material things (and) their hearts are always true; the fine, the rough and the smooth, they know about all those things. They can thus be compared to the finest soldiers, the elect of God Almighty. In this, Tuan, you are often held up as a warning example to all his servants.

I am invited by you to make a guess about his (Dipanagara's) present wishes: just my own personal view is that if my letter to the Raden Adipati (This refers to P. Dipanagara's Patih, R. T. Danukusuma, who was appointed as Patih in Jan. 1828 with the title of Raden Adipati Abdullah Danureja, see Rusche op. cit. Vol. II p. 24.) arrives at the same time as the letter from Basah Prawiradirja, it is probable that the Sultan of Java will be slightly amused, for Basah Prawiradirja and I will be thought to be vying with each other in trying to gain his confidence. If it did not arrive at the same time as Basah Prawiradirja's letter, it will be just that I am reprimanded for asking an end to the hostilities, (and) the Tuan Besar did not give his approval. But I think the matter will be seriously discussed, either he will send a messenger (The Javanese text repeats the same meaning twice: 'utusan' has the sense of a message from a highly placed person to an inferior, the passage may have a connection with the return of Pengalasan's first messengers on 2nd December without a satisfactory answer from Dipanagara's Patih. The latter had asked for a fifteen day truce, but this had not been granted by de Kock, hence the passage about "being reprimanded for asking an end to the hostilities, and the Tuan Besar (de Kock) now giving his approval." In the meantime messengers from Sentot to Dipanagara had also come through and were on their way to find Dipanagara (de Kock to Cleerens, DK No. 49 4 Dec. 1829, Cleerens to de Kock 5 Dec. 1829, No. 241).) or indeed answer by a letter (it will be a messenger or it may be an answer by a letter). As to your demands, Tuan, just in my opinion, putting aside (the question) of religion, probably he (Dipanagara) would take lands in Sala and Yogya, outside the lands which are under Government control, (and) the arrangement of the Kraton in my opinion, is that he would not be appointed nor take orders from the Government, except that they (Dipanagara and the N.I. Government) would be good friends, neighbours, (and) brothers, just like children who have not been on speaking terms and who now talk with each other again. They should not order each other, and they should not be ordered by each other.

Regarding the organisation of restoring the high state of religion Tuan, excepting the Dutch, to begin with, boys who have reached the age of puberty or older are all to be instructed to worship. Those who are already old (and) have not engaged in worship are to be instructed to double (the obligatory prayers) at one time, in Javanese terms to pay off their debt in instalments. For example if in the land of Rema there is a ruler who is willing to perform the obligatory prayers, and orders his followers to pray, then he can remain a ruler without let or hindrance. (But) in the event that he cannot perform the (obligatory) prayers, then he will indeed be changed, (or) if he cannot be changed he will certainly be attacked.

My own guess, Tuan, is that if the Sultan of Java does not succeed in his determination to raise up religion, then I think he would rather depart this earth. In these matters, Tuan, I ask your forgiveness for all my faults.
