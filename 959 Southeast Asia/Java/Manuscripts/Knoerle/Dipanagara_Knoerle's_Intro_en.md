# Introductory Note To The Journal Of Dipanagara's Journey To Menado And Its Author

This journal was written over the space of nearly two months (May 1st 1850- June 20th 1830) and constitutes one of the most important Dutch sources concerning Pangéran Dipanagara. It gives numerous insight into Javanese history  in the early nineteenth century and gives various comments about Dipanagara's character and family history. Many of the events described and comments related by Dipanagara can be checked both in the Dutch and Javanese sources for the period, moreover the informal style of this journal gives a spontaneity and interest which some of the more formalized Javanese Babad sources and Dutch military, and civilian reports lack. Most important perhaps is the fact that it helps to cast some light on a period of Dipanagara's life which has hitherto been almost totally neglected by historians, namely the period of his exile in Menado (1830-1854) and Macassar (1834-1855), and the Prince's state of mind after his final defeat. It is a compendium of Dipanagara's political, social end religious assumptions on which a more penetrating analysis of his character can be based. The Journal has so far not been published in full; a considerable part of it appeared in the short-lived journal 'De Oosterling' (2e Deel 1833) under Knoerle's own name, and de Klerck included a very small extract as an appendix for the fifth volume of his history of the Java war (1). No part has hitherto ever been published in English.

However lest historians rejoice and think that at long last the Prince has found his Boswell, there are certain important drawbacks which must be taken into consideration when assessing the historical importance of this source. Much centres on the character of the diarist himself for 2nd Lt Knoerle seems to have had a reputation as a liar, a degenerate and an egocentric fool. Pietermaat, the Resident of Menado (1827-1832) with whom Knoerle came in contact when he brought the Prince to Menado wrote to the Governor-General that he wished to have nothing to do "with a degenerate who seems only to take an interest in his 'souvenirs de campagne', his women and his money." and he also hinted that Dipanagara's monthly allowance of 600 guilders a month might have bean considerably larger if Knoerle had not embezzled much of it (2). Certainly Dipanagara's constant shortages of food whilst on his journey could be ascribed to dishonest management on the part of Knoerle who was entrusted with the Prince's welfare (3). In 1828 Knoerle had petitioned the Commissioner-General Du Bus de Gisignies for an honourable discharge from military service in view of his ill health but this was refused on the grounds that Knoerle had perjured himself twice, once on loaning his name to a companion for a gambling debt and another time for falsifying the amount of time he had spent at the front during the Java war (5).

Furthermore the Commissioner-General pointed out that if anyone had acted in an honourable fashion it was the N.I. Government itself who had taken Knoerle on from a foreign service ('vreemden dienst') and had raised him speedily to the rank of an officer in the 19th National Infantry Regiment. Then when he had pleaded ill-health the Government had given Knoerle a virtually sinecure position as co-editor of the 'Javasche Courant' with the sizeable monthly income of 300 guilders. His request for an honorable discharge from military service was therefore refused but he was allowed to return to Holland on leave. Knoerle appears to have returned to Java as a private adjutant of the new Governor-General, J. van den Bosch, who arrived in January 1830. One of his first duties was therefore to accompany Dipanagara to Menado, and the report which I have used for my translation was the original copy which Knoerle submitted to the Governor-General on his return (7). Knoerle's next appointment was as Assistant-Resident of Bengkulu in West Sumatra, which had lately been handed over by the British (8).

There he appears to have made himself Generally hated by the local population, and in the middle of 1833 he was murdered (8). When Van den Bosch paid a visit to the area shortly afterwards he was told that, "Assistant-Resident Knoerle had made himself hated by all classes of society for his temper, egotism and occasional brutality and also for his immoral conduct."(9). Knoerle's personal record is therefore to say the least a rather grim one, and it must be taken into account when assessing the importance of his journal as an historical source.

Finally Knoerle's knowledge of Javanese and Malay also appears to have been very sketchy. This was pointed out in the Commissioner-General's decision of 1828, when in clause 3 it states that, "He (Knoerle) said that during his four year's stay in N.I. he had acquired a good working knowledge of Javanese and Malay in his relations with the natives, but that when during the Java war he was placed in charge of a redoubt he more than once showed that he quite clearly did not understand the native chiefs with whom he came in contact." (10) De Klerck points out that although Knoerle styled himself as a linguist, it would seem very unlikely that he knew Javanese well in view of the fact that he had only spent five years in the area and that there were very few aids for learning local languages at that time (11). Certainly in the Journal itself there are numerous occasions when the Javanese that Knoerle gives does not correspond with his Dutch translation; 'rasa manah serigan' for ‘an access of rage' for instance (12) or 'dados tunggal kémawon' for 'being in agreement together (13). Knoerle did perhaps make use of his Javanese servant as a translator (14) but even then his comprehension of Dipanagara's Javanese must have been far from complete.

Thus although throughout the Journal Knoerle makes it appear that he had won Dipanagara's confidence and enjoyed his affection and esteem, the fact that the Prince used the address 'kowé' (low Javanese, 'you') when speaking to him, indicates that Dipanagara could not have had a very high opinion of him. When Dipanagara spoke with Captain Roeps for example he always used high Javanese (krama) (15). Besides Dipanagara never mentions Knoerle in any of his letters which he wrote during his exile when he often remembered Colonel Cleerens and Roeps (16). It is a pity that the Prince did not leave us his impressions about Knoerle, but it seems more than likely that he was not particularly taken with him, and one is left wondering whether he really wished Knoerle to accompany his womenfolk to Menado (17)!

Nevertheless for all this Knoerle's Journal is still deserving of our attention and if one can read it with caution it does still have considerable historical importance especially when it can be checked against other Dutch and Javanese sources.

As for Dipanagara's relations with Cleerens these seemed to have remained very close and as late as 1835 Dipanagara called on Cleerens to honour his promise (given before the Magelang conference) to free him. Needless to say this letter, the original of which is in the Arsip Negara, led to Cleerens immediate dismissal from the N.I. army and to severe restrictions on Dipanagara's liberty in Macassar (Geheim Besluit van den G.G. in Raad 13 March 1837, copy Arsip Negara.)
