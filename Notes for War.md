by Robert E. Hume

The continuance of war is the normal state of society, and the appropriateness of war is unquestioned, in those highly esteemed scriptures of popular Hinduism, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

This video (in French) explains the origin of the word for War. He explains where the word Gavisti comes from. For the summary, he explains there is many words for war in Sanskrit and Gavisti could be seen as a word for a "stupid war, between two tribes". He also says that Gavisti could be etymologically translated "Cow will" (gaus = cow, visti = the will to). It evolved to war because in the past, warriors where also responsable of protecting the livestock and during war periods, they coveted the neighbour' one. I think looking the video will give a better explanation, I don't speak Sanskrit nor know anything about it, but watched this video recently. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcrtbPs1mmU&feature=youtu.be&t=418

Hinduism, as pointed out succinctly by Jeff Spinner-Halev, "is a practice-based religion." <sup>18</sup>
