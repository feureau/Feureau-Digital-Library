#Writing The Past Inscribing The Future: History as Prophecy in Colonial Java
by Nancy Florida


## Acknowledgments

"This work has grown out of experiences and friendships that have spanned many years and many miles For those experience and for those friendships I am grateful to a number o individuals and institutions. Whe did this work begin? Wa it some twenty-five year ago wi my frst experences of Javanese culvar through the study of gamelan musicat Wesleyan University? Or was itin California and then in ova where I continued my study ofthe Javanese performing arts under the auspices ofthe American Society for Eastern Art in the 1970s? It was during these early tips to Java, in 971 and 1975-7, tha began my study of narrative radtions in o the manuscripe archives of Surakarta, Central Java. 1 remember those many long nights siting motionless, enthralled by what seemed to me the near magical performances ofthe puppet masters as they spun their tals. To these Javanese storytellers, especially to i Anom Suroto and to the lite Ki Suratmo Gurowihagio and the lte Ki Sutrisno, I owe my fascination with Javanese narrative with Javanese language and Tteso ture. My frst encounters wth Javanese manuseripts were in the library of the Mangkunagaran Palace and were encouraged by the late KR MTH Sanjoto Sutapo for whose many years of support and friendship I am deeply grateful. Others who influenced and shaped my carly experiences in Java were K RT Wasitodiningrat, th lace RL Martopangrawit the late Embah Jarwopangrawit and th lat Suranto Armospot.

In 1978 I returned to America to begin graduate studies in Southeast Asian history at Cornell University: Tomy teachers at Corel, especially to Oliver Wolters, David Wyatt, Benedict Anderson, and James Siege owe a deep debt of gratitude. The opportunity to read with them both

their own works and the works of others contrbuted to shaping my perspectives on writing and my appronches to reading. 1 am particularly indebted to Oliver Wolters th inspiration that his work has provided me and the fellowship that his friendship has afforded me have been guiding forees in my scholarly lif over th las seventeen years

When I to Jiva in 1980 t wasa eld director of the Surakarts Manusript Project, a project to microfilm manuscripe inthe three royal oo kara. Throush this project which was generously funded bythe National Endowment for the Humanities and the Cornell University Southeast Asia Program, 1 had the opportunity to go over almost three-quarter o fining. My work onthe manuscripts was made posite by the gracious permision oftheir Royal Highnesses L5 K 5 Pakubuwana Xlfand the late KG PAA. Mangunagara VIM as well as by the support of the late KRM-TH Sinjoto Sutopo Kusumohatmodjo, the late KG.PH. Prabuwiiya, K RIT Hardjonagoro and the National Archives of the Republicof Indonesia. Others whose efforts were indispensable to this project were: David Wyatt, Maryati Socbadio, the late KRT Mohammad Hosodo Pringgokoesoom,the late M. Ng, Kirmosayano, R. Pronadi Hartawiryana, Alan Feinstein Mulyoto, M. Husn Drasia, and Bambang Hening Typro "Then in 1985, through a projet that was funded bythe Ford Foundarion and was housed in the Saana Pustaka Library of the Keaton Surakar, this work wasextended to presrvethe original manuscripts as works far on paper Lam very grateful to fiends and collegues who worked with me on that archival project atthe Surakarts Paac, expecially to GPH. Puger G R.A. Kocs Moertiyah, Endang Ts Winazni and Kasmir fendi

Meanwhile in 1982, with the generous funding ofthe Socil Science Research Council and a Fubight-Hays fllowship and with the sponsor ship of the Lembaga lim Pengetahusn Indonesi in Jokart, I began the field work on Javanese hitoriographica traditions that would eventually culminate inthis book: A number of riends and colleagues influenced the course of that fed work. At the Kraton Surakarta I am grateful to GK.
Rate Alit GPH. Poespohadikocsoemo, G R.A. Koes Indryah, the late KRT Sustradiningrat and Tbo RT Pamardi Simpi for their asistance and advice. I am also deeply indebred to John Pemberton, B. J. Rianto Thorig Addibani, Tina Rosalia Yampalily, and Halim HLD; their ini

sights energies and fellowship enriched my understanding and informed my perspectives during those years in Surarts.

1 began wriing this book at Cornell in 2986 and wrote substantial portions of it there and at the Univesity of Michigan over the next four years. During this period I learned from conversations with and comments and criticisms from Benedic Anderson, Judith Becker Suzanne Brenner Audrey Kahin, Vitor Licherman, John Pemberton, Takashi Shi1aish, Ann Stoler Ameih Widodo Thomas Williamson, Oliver Wolters, and David Wyaee

In 1993-94 with generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Rackham Graduate School ofthe Univesity of Michigan, I was provided the opportunity to reconceive and rework this project A number of fiends and colleagues commented on portions (and in some cases entire rafts of the work as Iwas reshinking and rewriting it Thanks here are due to Alton Becker Katherine Bergeron, Joseph Errington, Valentine Daniel, Robert Hefner Marilyn Ivy, Daniel Lew Hendik Mates Adel Pinch, Vicente Rafl Laurie Sears, Mary Stendly, and Amrih Widedo 1 am also grateful for the editorial encouragement of Ken Wissoker of Dube Universit Press and for assieance with mape and figures from Robert Cowherd, Ron Fraker, Annabel Gallop and Adi Moersid. The publication of his volume is supported with a grant from the Office of the VicePresident for Research of the Univerity of Michi« gin

1am especialy to ohn Pemberton fr his many and signfcant contributions to the wring of this book, Wer it not for his nsighe and friendship I would I am quite sure, have written a very different work I have him to thank not only for encouraging my earl interes in Java but also for many years later challenging me totake a critical stance on that same interest Through his own writings as wellas hicritloms of mine he has enriched my understandings of ava in countless ways. And for he many and detailed comments on nearly every draft that this book has been through I am truly graceful.

A NOTE ON MANUSCRIPTS, SPELLING, PRONUNCIATION, AND TRANSLATION

Most of the original Jvanese manuscripts referred t in this book are from three repositaris in Suralart, Central Java: the Susana Pustaka in the Kraton Surakarta, the Relsa Pustaka in the Manghunagaran Palace and the Muscum Radyapustala. Ciations of these manuscrips include two reference systems. The intial "MS." reference refers to the cailog entry ofthe local repository (with "SP" for the Sasona Pustaka, "RP" for the Relsa Pustaka, and "Rp" fo the Radyapustaka). The "SMP" reference is based on the cataloging system of the Surakarta Manuscript Project In this system, "KS" refer to the Keaton Surakarta, "MN" to the nagaran, and "Rp" tothe Radyapustaa.

Almost two centuries ago Ronggasismits, a lidle-known writer from a well-known family of Javanese court pots, composed thee lines calling his readers o active and carefl readings of exemplary works no longer read?

And, itis precisely by engaging a particular text through translation tha Iam aso brought into a more expansive dialogue with a range of other texts and other Incase pasts For the text that 1 read was iself composed aqainst a background of readings of rio texts and contexts Translating Babad Joka Tingliin ull 1 am compelled to attend in a sustained manner both to is profound intertextuality and t is historicity to the sty loti Tinguisic and modes through which its writes in the particular reality of his or her Mistorcal becoming, worked to generate it senses.

The project of this book, then, is no simply to use indigenous texts to reconstruct a history of Javs itis ather o engage a particular Javanese text in an extended historical conversation in order to follow up on that texts own prophetic tendencies and o imagine with t a historical space forthe furure, The point is notto master the Javanese past o a ext of that past but t reinscrbe, through dialogue, a particular texts apparent future intentions. In a text like Babad Joka hat is a text that anoo My own reading and translation appear drawn up into this paicalar text' aferif, extending its future intentions into a world that was perhaps, not completely unforeseen by its propherc Javanese author?

Imagining how Babi Jka Tinghi, wanslated, might perform ts work withinthe large discursive spaces ofa lobal comparative dialogue clits further consideration ofthe poltical implications of this project, What might it mean o translate an "exotic" eat under the postcolonial conditions of the late twentieth century? Whose interests does it serve to introduce an obscure text from a "Third World" Iterature into English?
There ae, of course; no unambiguous answers to thesequstions »I would hope, however that by foregrounding the text ofa marginalized Southeast Asim write, I might just provoke a stutter in the universalizing projects ofa dominane discourse that effces marginal voies even as i would speak for exoticized others. Babad Jaka Tinghir a tex that aelf both expliidy and implicily quesions the centrality of any center that oe such projects. Through the translation ofthis particular Jvanese text -a translation produced by writing across differences instead of agaist diference--1 wish to introduce intothe dominant discourse the porentlly subversive agency ofthe authorial subject who composed it

How then, do I envision the procice of ranslation? If by tranlaing the text of Tinghir in all mean to work with it rather than on it in an imagined mastery of, how do I account for the proverbial violence the act of translation may perpetrate upon an other's ext?

nous meaning, It goes without saying that my translation of this nineseenth century Javanese writing of history is itself an interested rewri« ing ofthe "original" translates This translation, like any ranslation, is a rewriting a writing again which is t thesame time an ace of reading by a hisorically determined, desiring subject- writing-again lanstages Hteratures cultures and times that is tel located in the history of th condirions ofits own production ®

Pure, unmediated transaion is of course, impossible. And it is this very impossiblity that necesarly involves translation, intimately with the worlds in and through which it moves. Reading not only across but also through differences, translation obviously can never hope fully to recover or t convey an originary meaning. Nor does i offer a locus of toral expressive freedom. Rathe itis a prctce which works through the senses of th imagined origialin order to generate novel sense, Instead of a transparent reproduction and relay ofan original truth, translation is a task, as Benjamin understood that strives in dialogue with the original to realize and extend the poter truths the translated text apporently poses. Any translation is alvays both textual interpretation and texal supplement And all translation is located in history.

pas ruched away in a volume of oyal correspondence whose homeisnow e mous manuscript was inscribed (if not composed) by the mysterious hand of one associated wih that same palce-but not, as it tums out, the hand of one actually a court For the hand that inscribed Babad Jaka Tinghir belonged to a marginalized subject who wrote the history as he or she Ianguished, in political exile on a distant island remote from his or her oo to explore th relaionship beween the poem's propheric foresight and the exile of indigenous power in colonial Java: hat point where exile and prophecy along with writing and history converge in the tec sual work of a particular nineteenth-century Jvanese subject.

With Babad Jaka Tinghis a prophetic vanese poet composed the history of a eiical period inthe Javanese pst the lat fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, a period that saw the transition from the ancient HHinda- Buddhist fas Javanese regimes to the beginnings of Cental vanese Islamic hegemony. The poet wrote that history with distinctive style For unlike texts ofthe moe dominant tradton o fvanese history writing, this text does not chronicle a dynastic history preoccupied with the doings of kings and their armies in liar narrative fishion, Rather this poom interrupt the dominant genealogea iyle f the dynastichronice to reat the past episodicall; to generate a novel genealogy ofthe future Rather than focus on the genetic antecedents ofthe ruling cite of his or her present-day lav, th poet writes in a series f episode th stories ofa o historical. and cultural traditions. These episodes, writen from the vantage of xil, aredefily bound together to engender a new historical force which would emerge through contestation, rather than merely descend along royal bloodlines. Inscrbing a new future out of a tradional past the epic discloses a novel history whose effectiveness is selonsciously projected onto supgested tomorrows

"The Babad Joka Tinghr mosivating this book, this extended historical conversation, is certainly not the only history of Jaka Tinghir that was writin in ninereenth-century Java. Nor is i the only historical prophecy Itis however perhaps the only history of Jaka Ting rom which the famous "Youth from Tingkr® (legendary founder of the is of Cental Java's inland Islamic kingdom) is significantly absent. My reading of the text suggests tha this absence discloses the revolutionary kind of furure

What do we know of ierat audiences in the serifetional entity that I am calling "tradtional ava?

Was literacy in traditional Java restricted t th insular members of a tiny cite lass, an elite separated from and surrounded by a sen of itirate peasants? Or was the tradional reading public a somewhae more popular and porentaly populist entity?

Despite the abysmally low rates of literacy in fava preceding the 1945 Indonesian national revolution, th "Iterate" audience for writen texts was not as small as might be imagined."

Almost all the texts that today's Jvanese cll tradsional would have been originally witn, thats composed and inscribed, in Javanese sri: the tradional literature of Java i, forthe mos pae, a manuscript literture: As 1 mentioned above, a majority of these teas are composed in macapat verse forms written for sung performative readings. The language of many of these ters though Modern Javanese includes an admixture of archaic Kawi vocabulary. The texts tend to be writin in a linguistic style which marks them as "Iterary" in distinction from the language of ordinary speech. Many but by no mesns all of the text that make up this iteature were written by persons in some way associated with the royal palaces of Central Java

Despite the heterogeneous realty of thes texts there is nevertheless sill a urlity in pointing out certain charitersts that highlight the difference of writing traditionally in Javanese script from modern write ing-bath in the West and in Indonesia, How are we to understand this difference? What id it mean to write, to be a write in traditional Java?
How i the notion of author elated tothe realty of tex in this chrographic Hterature? At the outses, iti importantto note that the words usedin Java to designate "writer" do not share with Englsh (and French) the cognate "authority" of the modern author. The Javanese words for *writer" connor a rather diferent status for "the textual worker" (ng» kang akarya sastu) than does the modern Anglo-French author. The Javanese "writer" (pani, panyerat) may be the person who physically writes or inscrbes(analis anyeri) any tex th "sribe" by whose hand the witte artifact i produced. Then again the writer may be he works "composer" (pangangei, pangikt) she/he who "inerlces" and binds together" (ngitet) words or ext n textually producive manners Signifcants in traditional Java there is o clear istincion between these two categories of writing: that is writing as physical replication of prior inscription and writing as original composition. On the one hand, the seribe enjoyed a modicum of pot freedom in his or her "copying" (marin, nedhak, o text, which often engendered new varians and ver ooo tions of Jvanese textuality, would sometimes borrow (or "ranslate") from older works interlacing (ngangei) and rebinding (ngike) old tec tual fragments into new contexts to creat his or her rigial® work

The Modern Javanese version was composed by the man whois conventionally acclaimed the fther of the Surakartarenais sance the man whos thought to have fathered the rebirth of resumably dead Javanese letersfrom the grave in which the Moslem conquest had cast them. This man was Yasadipura L Ronggasasmia's famous grandfather the one who had been so fond of reading Suh texts

As it turns out, Cohen Stuar produced his philological work on Yasedipuri's tet with considerable embarrassment-and only because he was wunder orders from his civil service superiors at the Batavian Society of Ars and Sciences to do so. The philologists prefatory remarks to his aiton of this neoclassical Javanese text abound with apologies to his readers for subjecting them to such decadent, confused, and bastardized material He would have much prefered, he explains a commission to prepare an edition of the poem's much superior twelfih-century prototype. Disporaging Yasidipura's comprehension of Old fvanese as wellas hi iterary skill in Modern Javanese, this farher of Durch colonial philoory goes s far as to deplore the late king of Surakart's choice of one so ignorant as Yasadipura to translate the fin Aekeroin classic into Modern Javanese verse. In the same vein, the philologist complains of th ignoance of his own *natve informant," whose services, nevertheless, were doubdessly indispensable for Cohen Stuart's Durch translation of the poom. His disparaged "native informant? was none other than Yassdipura I's own great-grandson, Radan Ngabhi Ronggawarsia (ator

After Cohen Stuar, Dutch philology tured it attention away from Modern Javanese to Old Javanese literatur: Although nonacademic edi tions of Modern Javanese literary texts were stil published presumably as "appropriate" reading material for a small lass of prin-Iiterate favanese-and for Dutch colonial service trainees} these newer works were rarely considered worthy subjects for "serious" (read Dutch) scholar ship" Judged hapelesly involuted and derivative bythe brokers of intel lectual power the new Javanese text did not selon the Dutch East Indies philological marketplace.

Cang the literature of the eighteenth and nineteeth century feudal oral the progressive consciousness dismisses the writing ofthe Javanese past as summarily as ha the colonia hilologsts who followed Cohen Stuart.

Reating Tradtional Janese Writing Today: An Uncommon Moment

It was in this context of not reading in contemporary Java that I decided to write a book which would suggest what actually reading the teus of tradional Javanese writing could tll mean today. Th rel possiblity of the regeneration of traditional meaning was suggested to me by an inci dent that occurred in 1984, when one of those books was pulled from the shel, opened and (quite traditionally) read alouc. Although reading teus of tradional Javanese writing was hardly popular among the avant arde youth of Solo inthe early 1otos it was hen thar a young at student and somguriter who went bythe name BJ came up with the idea of pursing the melodies of raditonal verse to guitar music for performance at Solo's university. He remembered the basic melodies of most of the macapat mesess as wellas the words t one r two standard verses he had learned to sing as a child, but needed more lyrics to fll out the performance Knowing that my work involved the texts of traditional BJ came to mein search of materia.

The imaginary ego of the text a certain Jayengbaya, rying to decide just what to be in this lif moves through a series of fantasized career choices. In every imagined cas, he fil from the enjoyment of pleasures pinacle to catastrophic ruin-often to diand death, For example much in the idiom of a usdccar dealer Iyengbaya imagines ife as a horse trader Reveling in the good lie after making a Lilli off of an unsuspecting customer Jayingbaya is then himself lille in a gory accident while aking one of his horses on a tral run. Again, our hero imagines a life of lixury as a Dutchman's houscbay.
