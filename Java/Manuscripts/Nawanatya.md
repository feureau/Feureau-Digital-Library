It seems that the Nawanatya text deals especially with the ``nine modes of expression'' of the courtier in his service of the king; elsewhere we find those of the poet (Sum) and of the dancer (Nag). It does not seem likely that in Sum. and Nag. the Nawanatya text is meant, or any particular text. The derivation from Skt. nati seems questionable (cf Pig.).  nawanatya
