## Ranggawarsita's historiography
For it is evident that Ranggawarsita should not be judged by the standards of modern histo- riography. The standard to be applied is that of pujangga-ship

## Pujangga
We need not enter here into the origin of the much discussed word pujangga, Most of what has been written and speculated about this word has been summarized by Professor Gonda in his Sanskrit in Indonesia (1952). (Loc. cit., pp. 371-375; see also: W. Aichsele, Bhujangga, in: Oriens Extremus, vol. II (1955), pp. 109-120.)

Ranggawarsita, the Pustaka Raja Madya and the Wayang madya
By G. W. J. Drewes

In another ms., being an autograph copy of R. M. Sumahatmaka's Sérat Babad ila-ila, compiled in 1912, I came across a somewhat different statement. The 22nd chapter of this compilation deals with the history of the wayang. At the end of this chapter, which is based on the well-known Sastramiruda of Pangeran Kusumadilaga, the editor has added some information concerning the origin of the wayang madya, to the effect that Ranggawarsita made Mangkunagara IV a present of a copy of his Pustaka Raja Madya; that the Prince ordered wayang plays to be made on the basis of this work, and that the size of the puppets required for these plays be that of the wayang purwa set Kyai Sebet, which had been completed shortly before, This order was issued in 1867.

The puppets were made by and under the supervision of R.M.A. Tandakusuma, Mangkunagara IV's son-in-law and a brother of R.M.T. Yudanagara, the grandfather of Dr Poerbatjaraka. In Mangkunagaran tradition no corroboration was found for Dr Pigeaud's supposition that R.M.A. Tandakusuma was the author of the majority of the wayang madya plays. He is held in memory as a marvellous topeng dancer, whom the Prince's eldest daughter chose for her husband, and is also remembered because of his concern with the development of the langéndriyan, the Javanese opera, in which all parts are filled by women and which has become a speciality of the Mangkunagaran. This highly stylized entertainment is said to have developed from a kind of operetta originally performed by female workers employed in the batik shop of a Mr. Gottlieb, situated in the Sala kampung which after him is still named Godliban.

According to an oral account, Tuwan Godlib (also spelled Godlip or Godliep) was the owner of a batik-making company. Even today a suburb where he used to live is named after him: Godliban.
