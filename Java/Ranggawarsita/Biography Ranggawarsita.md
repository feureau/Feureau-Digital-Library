## Ranggawarsita, Raden Ngabei 1802-1873;

Javanese court poet

Probably the most famous, though not necessarily the most widely read, poet at the Central Javanese courts of Surakarta in the 19th century was Raden Ngabei Ranggawarsita, great grandson and grandson of the well-known court poets Yasadipura I and II, who likewise enjoyed the patronage of the Surakarta rulers. Ranggawarsita is generally regarded as "the last of the court poets" (Pujangga panutup), yet it is not certain when this honorific title, used for the learned poet who was simultaneously an official scribe, a scholar, and a prolific writer of moralistic and didactic works as well as belles lettres in the service of the highest nobility of Surakarta, was bestowed upon him. While scholars such as J.A. Day have held that he came to be known as such after his death, others have argued that he was already called so during his lifetime; it is generally assumed that the title also referred to the poet's excellent qualities. Scholars such as George Quinn have considered this title as an indication of the condition of Javanese literature in general, that it implied that Ranggawarsita would never be equaled and that he would never have a successor - despite the fact that the Javanese courts remained in existence long after the great poet's death, and that men of letters continued to write for Javanese noblemen well into the 20th century.

The title of pujangga was used in Javanese writings during Hindu-Buddhist times to refer to a Brahman or other person of clerical rank. At the East Javanese court of Majapahit in the 14th century the term indicated a category of scholars or religious officials. The assumption was made by Vlekke that it was the task of a new king's pujangga to sanction the claim to legitimacy, each time the center of power shifted to a new place. Following an intermittent period in which newly emerging Islamic rulers in the Pasisir area along Java's north coast were strongly oriented toward international Islamic culture, the use of this title at the Islamic court of Surakarta signaled a renewed interest in the Hindu-Buddhist cultural and literary heritage, which the Dutch scholar Pigeaud termed the "renaissance of classical Javanese literature in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." During this period court literati, primarily the members of the Yasadipura family, recomposed many of the ancient Old Javanese literary works in more modern poetic forms, which made a great impact on the flourishing of theatrical and musical art. forms related to the traditional shadow puppet plays (wayang).

Ranggawarsita's major accomplishment was the monumental literary work in prose entitled Pustaka Raja Purwa (The Book of Kings of Ancient Times), intended as the first part of a "trilogy" covering the mythical past of Java, beginning with Adam and the Indian gods, from the (fictional) year 1 until the year 730. On account of correspondences in content and form, Drewes assumed that the Pustaka Raja was modelled after the great Serat Kandha ("Book of Tales") which was probably written by Yasadipura I and II in the second half of the 18th century. More recently, a relationship has been argued by Day with the prophecies of king Jayabaya, the legendary wise king of the medieval East Javanese kingdom of Kedhiri who features in eschatological prophecies of the Islamic period. Generally, the Pustaka Raja is considered to belong to the "books of tales" genre of the Pasisir literature of the 17th and 18th centuries, which had been continued in the major history of the court of Surakarta (Babad Surakarta) by Ranggawarsita's great ancestor, Yasadipura I.

Although the lengthy Pustaka Raja is often viewed as an attempt to write a comprehensive history of Java, according to Pigeaud the author's purpose apparently was not to write a historical chronicle, but rather to provide "encyclopedic knowledge of the whole of human history." The impression of a historical, linear development has been created by the arrangement of the myths and legends according to a chronology of solar and lunar years apparently of Ranggawarsita's own invention, starting from the Paramayoga, an introductory cosmogony or story of the gods, until the death of Arjuna's great-grandson, concluding the Mahabharata epic.

In Java, the Pustaka Raja was highly appreciated by Ranggawarsita's contemporaries and served as a source of inspiration to learned literati - including the well-known ruler and poet Prince Mangkunagara IV - as well as to following generations of learned authors and performers of the shadow puppet theater, wayang kulit. Epigones of the Mangkunagaran House wrote extensions entitled Pustaka Raja Madya and Pustaka Raja Puwara, with stories from supposedly later, post-epical times, including legends from the medieval East Javanese kingdoms, and thus covering the entire Hindu-Buddhist era in Java.

The appreciation for Ranggawarsita's work has not remained constant. Although he collaborated with Dutch contemporaries such as the linguist C.F. Winter in Surakarta and wrote a work on Javanese grammar, 19th-century Dutch scholars criticized Ranggawarsita's alleged lack of knowledge of Old Javanese. Even the western-educated Javanese scholar Poerbatjaraka was highly critical of the lack of reliable historical information in the Pustaka Raja. In Javanese society, the social criticism expressed in the poem Kalatidha, paraphrased as "the age of madness," has received much attention. This poetic complaint, meant as an elegy on social problems and lack of norms in the poet's own time, has often been interpreted as a prediction of the social upheaval in the following 20th century.

Lately, scholars both in Indonesia and abroad have paid much attention to Ranggawarsita's alleged prophetic qualities. Yet, most of the works of this typical 19th-century Javanese "man of letters" were of a didactic, moralistic, and philosophical nature. In spite of his fame, his works are not well-known to ordinary Javanese, probably because they are written in an ornate literary idiom that makes them rather inaccessible to modern Javanese readers. ***Clara Brakel-Paperhuyzen.***
