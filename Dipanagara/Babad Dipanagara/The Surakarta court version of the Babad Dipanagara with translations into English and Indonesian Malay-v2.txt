PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Despite the existence of a large body of Javanese historical (babad) literature on Dipanagara (1785-1855) and the period of the Java War (1825-30), very few texts nave been published or made available in any form.' The following editon and translation in English and Indonesian Malay of Codex Orientalis 2114 Dipanagara) of the Leiden University Library is thus intended to partially fill this gap in modern Javanese historiography. In particular, the text and detailed historical

notes are offered as a contribution to the understanding of the Javanese view of events during a crucially important period of Javanese history.

The present babad, which was originally translated as part of the present author's doctoral thesis,? has been singled out for publication for a variety of reasons. First, because it is one of the earliest contemporary accounts available, having been written at the Surakarta court shortly after the outbreak of the Java War in July 1825. Secondly, because this text, which is written in a clear court idiom, is short enough (52 folio sized pages in manuscript) to be translated without too much difficulty. Most of the other historical accounts dealing with Dipanagara go into many hundreds of folios in the originals and frequently present problems of textual interpretation. Thirdly, because the Surakarta babad provides an interesting and critical view of Dipanagara, written as it was at a court which was both hostile to Yogyakarta and deplored the prince's relations with the religious communities.
Finally, because, for the short period of weeks covered by this babad, there are numerous other sources, both European and Javanese, which can be used to corroborate and refute the babad's descriptions. Thus it is possible to establish a reasonably accurate account of the events and, at the same time, test the overall reliability of the present text as a source in its own right. In this instance the degree of historical reliability is remarkable and throughout his work, the babad writer has shown a grasp of accurate detail which can be confirmed time and again in the other Javanese and European sources. In a wider context, therefore, che present text can be regarded as a test case for assessing the historical value of Javanese babad materials in the early nineteenth century. At a time when powerful arguments have been advanced to support the theory of a decline in the accuracy of certain branches of Javanese historiography in the eighteenth century,? it is important to be able to stress the fact that the writing of Javanese accounts dealing with contemporary events remained as versatile and as precise as ever.

On the other levels too, this babad is of value especially for the study of Javanese social and cultural history. The literary construction of the chronicle, for example, in a number of different scenes, reflects the theatre forms which dominated cultural life in Surakarta in the early nineteenth century. Indeed, the text is suffused with the imagery and drama of the wayang kulit (shadow puppet theatre) and wayang topeng (masked dance theatre), which are known to have been favoured by the Surakarta ruler, Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820), himself a great patron of the arts. The babad thus provides a useful insight into the hitherto unresearched artistic milieu of the Surakarta court during the reign of Pakubuwana IV and his successors.

Babad Dipanagara

Furthermore, there are many descriptions and vignettes in the narrative which are enlightening for social historians. These include the descriptions of Dipanagara's improvements to his lands ar Sélarong (I. 12-16), the unscrupulous methods of the Yogyakarta police officials (Maranran) (I1. 14-16), the jago (lit.: 'fighting cock) qualities associated with Javanese bandit chiefs (III. 18-19), the difficulties of road construction work in the minutely fragmented core regions (negers eg«ng) of the Central Javanese courts (VI. 1-10), the types of money in circulation (11. 16; IV. 4) and the sorts of clothes worn by people in Java at this time (II. 14; VIII. 11; VIII. 16; XI. 5). All these details help to deepen our understanding of Javanese society on the eve of the Java War. They also refute the claim, made by some criucs of Javanese babad sources, that the latter only mirror the narrow viewpoint of court and ignore social realities. In this edition, the social comments have been set in the context of other contemporary sources, mostly European, which deal with the economic and social conditions in Java in the early nineteenth century. The notes from these sources are intended to go some way towards sketching in the main social and economic issues which precipitated the Java War, although a full discussion of

developments during this period must await the outcome of further monographic study."

As an historian, I make no pretensions to great expertise in the held of Javanese literature. The fact that this text has reached publication at all is due to the generous help of numerous scholars and friends. The first draft of the transliteration of the manuscript was completed in Jakarta in 1971 by Bapak Djoko Hardojo, an editor of the Javanese magazine Kenthi. The preliminary English translation was then prepared in Yogyakarta with the help of the late Drs. Mudjanattistomo. Later, the drafts were read through by Prof. P.J. Zoetmulder, S.J., Dr. Th.G.Th. Pigeaud and Dr. M.C. Ricklefs, who all offered valuable comments on the translation. In particular, Prof. G.W.J. Drewes painstakingly corrected my numerous initial errors and helped me to establish a more accurate final version of the English translation.
Meanwhile, my rendering of the Javanese text in Indonesian Malay was kindly checked through by my wife, Noes Carey, and by Dra. Dewi Mariah, both native speakers of Indonesian. The collection of European manuscript materials was facilitated by the constant assistance of Mr. F.G.P. Jaquet of the Koninklijk Instituut (Leiden), Mr. M.G.H.A. de Graaff of the Algemeen Rijksarchief (The Hague) and Miss Soemartini, the Director of the Indonesian National Archives (Arsip Nasional) in Jakarta. Thanks are also due to the Council of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for fpublishing this study, which lies far outside the normal bounds of Malaysian history, and to Magdalen College (Oxford) for providing me with generous financial support, good company and fine surroundings in which to work.

To all those named above and to many others, especially in Indonesia and the Netherlands, 1 owe a deep debt of gratitude for their help made this monograph

possible. But any faults and shortcomings which remain are entirely my own and I assume sole responsibility for these.

The two year delay in the publication of this book has been caused by local publishing difficulties in Malaysia. That it has appeared at all is due to the unstinting efforts of the Editor of the MBRAS, Tan Sri Dato Mubin Sheppard, to whom go my heartfelt thanks

NOTE ON THE SPELLING, PRONUNCIATION AND ETYMOLOGY OF THE NAME "DIPANAGARA'

"Dipanagara' is the linguistically correct romanised spelling of the prince's name and it has been used throughout this book. 'Dipanegara' is a variant spelling which occurs frequently in contemporary documents and is used by many present-day writers. It is less linguistically correct, although 'nuagara' and 'négara' have become fully interchangeable in Modern Javanese.

The consonant indicators ('ha'. 'na'. 'ca', 'ra'. 'ka' etc.), known as aksaras in Javanese, are always pronounced with an 'o' (4) sound (as in the English 'taught') provided they are not followed by a syllable with a different vowel sound (e.g. *r?'. 'kvw') or occur in a 'closed' syllable (e.g. 'rar', 'kar'). In these cases the aksaras are pronounced with a flat 'a' (@) (as in the English 'father'): hence 'àri', 'àku', 'ràràs' and 'karra'. Also in words with three 'simple' aksaras (i.c. those without special vowel indicators), the '&' sound of the first changes into an 'a" sound: hence 'sagard'. 'nagara'. Thus the correct Modern Javanese pronunciation of Dipanagara's name is 'Dipanagara'. or Dipanegara' if the variant spelling is used. Most of the prince's modern descendants (e.g. those living in Ujung Pandang) spell their family name phonetically: *Diponegoro'.

In his conversations with Lt. J.H. Knoerle (*Journal', p. 10). Dipanagara gave an interesting etymological analysis of his name stating that 'Dipa' was derived from the Sanskrit 'Dipa' ('lamp') and meant someone 'who spread enlightenment or who possessed life and force'. Since 'nagara' is the equivalent of 'an area, province or country', Dipanagara considered his name to indicate a man 'who gave enlightenment, power and prosperity to a country'. The usual derivation of the Javanese 'Dipa' as used in Javanese proper names is from the Sanskrit 'Dwipa' ('elephant'). see GR, vol. 1, p. 587.

INTRODUCTION

I. THE MANUSCRIPT

The Javanese babad transliterated and translated here under the ttle, 'An Account of the Outbreak of the Java War (1825-30) is contained in Codex Orientalis 2114 of the Leiden University Library collection of oriental manuscripts. This manuscript, which formed part of the private collection of Professor Taco Roorda, was bought from his heirs by the library in 1874 along with various other Javanese manuscripts mainly of Surakarta origin." Ir has a pencil note on the first page written in Roorda's own handwriting describiag it as the 'Babad Dhiponogoro' and has his signature below it. On the next page, by way of an introduction, the babad copyist has pur the utle Sérat Babadipun Dipandgaran (Chronicle of Dipanagara). A.C. Vreede, in his catalogue of Javanese manuscripts in the Leiden collection," wrote that it consisted of a fragment of the history of Dipanagara written in the beautiful hand of the cariks scribes) of the Surakarta court. He noticed that it deviated completely from all the other Leiden manuscript versions of the Babad Dipanagara, the collection of Javanese chronicles dealing with the life and times of Dipanagara.' The manuscript itself is only 52 folio sized pages long and is written on Netherlands-Indies government paper in a fine black quadratic script with red and green rubrics at the start of the

cantos and verses.* It ends abruptly at the top of the fifty second folio and it appears chat another canto, with an unidentifiable metre, was meant to follow.

The origins of the manuscript are not clear, but it is possible that it was a fragment taken from a much longer court chronicle. The use of Dutch government paper points to the fact thar it was a copy and on the title page, in the same hand, three other manuscripts are referred to which may have formed part of the same bundle." The date of the manuscript (see below pt. II) suggests that it might have been made for the gifted Javanese linguist, A.D. Cornets de Groot Jr., who served in Surakarta first as an ééve voor de Javaansche Taal (student in the Javanese language) (1819-23) and then as Secretary of the Residency (1823-27).'" It is known, for example, that he was on especially close terms with the Surakarta Patih (prime

minister), Raden Adipati Sasradiningrat I1 (1812-1846), who lent him many Javanese manuscripts from the Surakarta kraton (court) for his language studies'' and who

may have been the patron under whose aegis this babad was written (see below pt.
III). Burt it is significant that there is no mention of a Babad Dipanagara amongst the Javanese and Malay manuscripts bought by the missionary scholars J.F.C. Gericke, from the estate of Cornets de Groot, after the latter's untimely dearth in the Netherlands in 1829.'% Furthermore, if it had been retained by his heirs, it should have formed part of the A.D. Cornets de Groot collection which was deposited in the

Leiden University Library in 1871."

XV

Babad Dipanagara

A more likely explanation is that the babad was copied either for use in the Javanese Language Institute (Instituut voor de Javaansche Taal) which Gericke set up in the Sunan's capital in 1832, or directly for Roorda himself after he had become Professor at the Delft Royal Academy for engineers and colonial civil servants in 1842.'* Both C.F. Winter Sr., the official interpreter (franslateur) of Javanese at the Surakarta Residency (1825-1859), and J.A. Wilkens (1813-1888), a student of Winter, were active in collecting Javanese manuscripts in Surakarta at this time and the copy could have been made on their orders. The manuscript could

then have reached Roorda when the materials of the Surakarta Language Institute were sent to Delft after its disbandment in 1843, or dispatched directly to Roorda at

a later date. Roorda's handwriung is the earliest to appear on the babad and materials for the study of Javanese were much in demand in Delft after the Royal Academy had just been opened." The three other manuscripts which were copied at the same time as the Babad Dipanagara can also be traced in Roorda's collection.

Whatever the origins of the babad were, it does not appear that Roorda made any use of it during his lifetime, despite the fact that in 1860 he published a Dutch translation of a portion of another version of the Babad Dipunagara which deals with the outbreak of the Java War.!" The first person to make a brief summary of the contents of the present manuscript was Vreede in 1892 and it bears notes written by him in pencil in the margins as well as some corrections to the text.!" Since Vreede's survey, it has not been the subject of further study.

II. THE DATE OF THE MANUSCRIPT

The date given at the beginning of the manuscript, Kemis Wage. 19 Besar, taun Be, A.J. 1752, converts into Thursday 4 August 1825. The scribe mentioned that he

began writing at eleven o'clock at night, which, according to Javanese reckoning would fix the date on the fourth. This is because the Javanese day changes at sunset

and not at midnight as in western systems. If the latter was strictly adopted, the date should read Wednesday 3 August 1825, since the manuscript was begun at eleven p.m. on that day. This means that the composition of the babad was commenced exactly two weeks after the Dutch attack on Dipanagara's residence at Tegalreja just outside Yogyakarta (Wednesday 20 July 1825), an action which marked the start of the Java War. The chronicle was therefore written when Dipanagara's campaign against the Dutch and their allies in the Yogyakarta kraton was in its very earliest stages. Furthermore, the babad does not seem to have spanned a very long period.
The latest date which can be identified in the episodes referred to in the text is Friday 5 August. This was the day when the Yogyakarta official, Raden Tumenggung Ranadiningrat, was wounded in a skirmish wich Dipanagara's forces in the streets of the Sultan's capital.!* The earliest incidents covered by the babad are those connected with the improvements to the minor roads around Yogyakarta which took place in late May and early June 1825 and which caused Dipanagara's final break with the Dutch.?° Thus the text covers a time span of just over two months and deals in detail with the immediate developments leading up to the outbreak of the

Java War, the Dutch reactions to the events and the first hostilities (see below pt.
X).

If the date given in the babad is accepted as being genuine this would make it the oldest extant manuscript version of the Babad Dipanagara written by an

XVI

Introduction

immediate contemporary. Dipanagara's own autobiographical account, which he <rew up in exile in Menado, was not composed until nearly two years after the end of the Java War in 1830 (see below pt. V. A.). Whereas the two other accounts written by participants in the events, Cakranagara's Buku Kedhbung Kibo and Jayadiningrat's 'Sketches on the Java War', were not put together until 1842-3 and 1857 respectively (see below pt. V.B. and E.). It should be noted, however, that the dating of the present babad as it now stands is somewhat unusual. In particular, it is rare for an early nineteenth century chronicle to have numerals and not Javanese chronograms (candrasengkala) to indicate the dates. Likewise, the inclusion of the Christian year, 1825, alongside the Javanese date reflects a certain degree of European influence on the manuscript's composition. This is further borne out by the spelling of many Dutch names with the sastra swara (letter), 'fa', and by the presence of a handful of Dutch words in the manuscript."! The earliest period that dating from the Christian calendar was used in other Javanese manuscripts relating to Dipanagara was in 1876, when the first copy of Pangeran Suryanagara's court chronicle was composed in Yogyakarta (see below pr. V.C.). Before thar time only chronograms and Javanese dates were employed. Perhaps the peculiarities of the present text in this respect are an indication of the greater Dutch influence on the mores of the Surakarta court when compared to those of Yogyakarta during the same period." They may also be connected with the fact that the manuscript was probably copied on the orders of the Dutch. But they do not necessarily mean that the dates given at the start of this babad should be rejected as unauchentic.

[II. THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE MANUSCRIPT

Neither the name of the patron who commissioned the work nor that of the scribe are mentioned in the babad, but Vreede's opinion that the script used in the text originates from Surakarta is undoubtedly correct. The same near quadratic script was used on official Surakarta correspondence dating from the period of Pakubuwana VI (1823-30), and it can be considered peculiar to the Sunan's court. "* Unfortunately, this does not help us to locate the original author or patron of the work. Since the present manuscript was almost certainly a copy, it was probably transcribed by a court carik working on the orders of Cornets de Groot, Winter or Wilkens. After a study of the text, however, it seems possible ro hazard the suggestion that the original babad was written under the'patronage of Raden Adipati Sasradiningrat II of Surakarta. Besides the latter's interest in Javanese literature, he also wielded considerable influence in the Surakarta kraton at the time of the outbreak of the Java War by virtue of his position as an unofficial guardian of the young Sunan, Pakubuwana VI.!* If Sasradiningrat was the patron of the babad, this would explain why so much information concerning co-operation with Yogyakarta on road construction projects

was included in the text and why the Yogyakarta Path, Danureja IV (1813-1847), occupies such a central place in the narrative."

The office of the Surakarta prime minister could be expected to have maintained close contacts with Yogyakarta throughout this period. There were many matters which had to be dealt with in common by both courts. Various legal, territorial and agrarian questions, which arose in the nagara agung (core regions of the realm), were officially settled by the Paths who met periodically at Klathen, midway between the courts. The two prime ministers also corresponded with each other over criminal cases, for it was common for criminals to seek refuge in the territories

XVII

Babad Dipanagara

controlled by different princely states."* Moreover, apart from these official contacts, there were many clandestine links berween the Central Javanese kratons which sometimes involved the Patihs. Thus, in 1812, Sasradiningrat's predecessor, Raden Adipati Cakranagara (1810-12), played a leading role in maintaining the secret correspondence between the Sunan and the Sultan which eventually precipitated the British attack on Yogyakarta (19-20 June 1812). Indeed, it is interesting that the correspondence itself was largely instigated by Pakubuwana IV, because he wished to keep himself better informed on the viewpoints of his Yogyakarta rival.?"

Other members of the court communiues also had their own channels of communication. Mangkunegara II of Surakarta (1796-1835), an unswerving enemy of the Sultan, kept a close watch on the Yogyakarta court and apparently enjoyed relating malicious gossip about his opponent to the Surakarta Resident." Personal relationships between princes at the different courts were likewise important. Some religious teachers counted members of both kratons amongst their pupils and this must have led to closer personal contacts berween noblemen and officials in Yogyakarta and Surakarta at this time."" Occasionally, private visits were paid by noblemen to opposing courts: shortly before the Java War, for example, Pakubuwana VI's army commander was reported to have made a clandestine, night call to one of the princes in the Yogya kraton,?" and later Dipanagara recalled that he had made the acquaintance of two Surakarta Pangerans on the occasion of their visits to Yogyakarta."! Meanwhile, a flow of unofficial messengers kept the links between the courts open. In 1812, santris (men of religion) from both kratons carried secret messages berween the rulers, and, in 1815, ar the time of the abortive Sepoy plot in Central Java, members of the g/adhags (porters® guilds) served as emissaries for Pakubuwana IV and the British-Indian soldiers in the Yogya and Sala garrisons.??

The territorial situation in Central Java was also more fluid before 1825 than it came to be after the Java War. This was because of the close juxtaposition of Surakarta, Yogyakarta and MangkunZgaran landholdings in the nagara agung, the central apanage areas of Mataram, Pajang and Kedhu. In these regions, villages and tracts of land held by one court were often placed directly adjacent to desas and

areas controlled by another court. It was sometimes even the case that separate villages were divided between all three courts." This gave rise to interesting situations,

for Dutch officials resident in one court town would frequently get information

about developments in an area ruled by another princely state, before their colleagues who were accredited to that state. Thus, in July 1825, firm news of Dipanagara's warlike intentions reached the Yogyakarta Resident, A.H. Smissaert, first by way of the Resident of Surakarta, who reported a movement in a village

belonging to Dipanagara near Surakarta in the Pajang area."* Later, during the Java War itself, many Surakarta desas were forced to make common cause with Dipanagara's supporters because they lay between Yogyakarta territory.""

All these contacts, both official and unofficial, m-ant that the degree of accurate information concerning events in Central Java was considerable at both courts in the early nineteenth century. Moreover, situations which were likely to prove difficult or politically dangerous were closely watched. In October 1823, when Raden Mas Saperdan's appointment as Sunan Pakubuwana VI threatened to throw Surakarta

XVIII

Introduction

nto confusion, Dipanagara related that people in Yogyakarta at the time were of the =m conviction that the appointment would give rise to a rebellion of the Surakarta princes against the Dutch government.?" Likewise, in July 1825, the Surakarta court seems to have been in close touch with the events which were taking place in Yogyakarta through the medium of religious teachers such as Kyai Maja. Indeed, many princes appear to have been on the verge of going over to Dipanagara, before the prompt arrival of General H.M. de Kock on 30 July, reassured them that the Dutch were taking measures to contain the rebellion. After the General's arrival, they probably continued tu receive detailed reports about the early course of the =ghting against Dipanagara from the Mangkun@garan and Kasunanan troop detachments which were sent to reinforce the Yogyakarta garrison in late July.!! It is interesting in this respect that the first person to provide accurate information to the Dutch about Dipanagara's headquarters at Selarong was a cavalry captain (ritmeester) of the Mangkunegaran Legion who was captured by Dipanagara's forces in carly August whilst on convoy duty.""

In view of the above, it is not surprising thar a Surakarta pujangga (court poet) should have been in a position to write a highly accurate account of the events surrounding the outbreak of the Java War in Yogyakarta. Moreover, if he had connectons with Sasradiningrat, who occupied such an influential position in Surakarta at this time and who was directly involved with the dispatch of the Sunan's troops to Yogyakarta, the amount of information available to him would have been all the greater. We shall see below how another member of the Surakarta Patih's staff, the future Raden Adipati Cakranagara I of Purwareja, was also able to draw up a detailed and precise history of the same period on the basis of reports available to him in Surakarta and his own experiences on the bartlefsont (see below pt. V.B.)

IV. THE VIEWPOINT OF THE AUTHOR

Although there was very litle sympathy in Surakarta for the person of Dipanagara, many people at the Sunan's court secretly supported his stand against the Ducch.
Both courts had suffered equally from the sweeping annexations of their territory by the European government during the period of Daendels (1808-11) and Raffles (1811-16), and from the precipitate abolition of the land rent in the princely states in May 1823. At the same rime, the Dutch government's handling of the Jabarangkah and Karang Kobar annexations in January 1825 and its scarcely concealed territorial designs on the western mancanagara provinces of Bagelen and Banyumas had caused as much anxiety in Surakarta as in Yogyakarta.** The politics of the Sunan's court were never as overtly hostile to the Dutch as those pursued in Yogyakarta, but deep feelings of bitterness towards the colonial government always existed below the surface. Thus, whilst Surakarta afforded Dipanagara no direct assistance at the start of the hostilities and few of the Sunan's officials fought for the prince during the war itself, there is evidence that many Sala courtiers were privately pleased by his campaign against the Dutch. One of these silent admirers was Pakubuwana VI, who, emulating the policies of previous Surakarta rulers, planned to reap substantial political rewards from che disturbances in the Sultanate.*' This generally favourable attitude in Surakarta court circles towards Dipanagara's resolute anti-European stance is clearly reflected in the present babad. Thus the author has evidently raken some relish in depicting the prince's humiliating treatment of Dutch officials (VII.
22-24) and he has portrayed the latter as being totally dependant on the advice of

XIX

their Javanese colleagues. In Yogyakarta, Surakarta and Semarang, the Residents are shown to defer completely to the political expertise of the local Javanese officials JV. 19-29; VIL. 4-8; VL 17-23; VI. 32-36; VII. 2-10; VIII. 2-6; VIII. 45-47; X. 16-21; XII. 9-17; XII. 26-28). He also seems to have understood the nature of Dipanagara's enmity with various members of the Yogya court on the eve of the Java War. Figures with whom Dipanagara was particularly at variance, such as Wiranagara and Paku Alam, are therefore described in a disparaging way as cowards and fops (V. 32-34; VIII. 49-50). Of the prince's antagonists, only Danureja is cast in a positive light in the babad, an exception which may derive from Sasradiningrat's role in the composition of the text."!

One of the most interesting features of the babad writer's portrayal of the main characters in his narrative, is the way in which he has almost instingtively compared them to figures in the Javanese wayang (shadow puppet theatre). Wiranagara, for example, the double-dealing commander of the Sultan's bodyguard, is brilliantly equated with Path Arya Sangkuni, the devious adviser of the Kurawa faction in the Mahabharata cycle of wayang plays (VIII. 50). Similarly, Dipanagara is likened in a critical way to the handsome but shallow Raden Samba, the son of Prabu Kresna, ruler of Dwarawati (VIII. 21 and see below). Meanwhile. the Dutch officials, Smissaert and Chevallier, are depicted alternately as giants (bura) and clown-retainers (panakawan) (IV. 8-12), two classifications which seem to have sprung readily to the minds of Javanese when dealing with the Dutch in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." What makes these descriptions even more intriguing is thar in some cases they clearly fitted the physical appearances of the historical figures concerned. Thus Smissaert, who was characterised in one European source as a 'small, fat and shy man', was portrayed by another contemporary observer as a 'fine,

little Sancho (Panza), the most archetypal parakawan figure in European literature. **

The use of wayang imagery in the Javanese chronicles concerning Dipanagara can also be seen in Cakranagara's Bukx Kedbung Kebo and in Dipanagara's autobiographical babad (see below pt. V.A. and B). But, whereas in these two latter works, the imagery was evoked for specific purposes of spiritual and political legitimation, in this babad it has been used mainly for dramatic effect." Indeed, the work itself seems to have been conceived and written up in the manner of a wayang wong or wayang topeng performance with set scenes (ailéfgan) and sharply delineated actors.
Nowhere is this influence of the wayang on the artistic structure of the babad clearer than in the description of the Yogyakarta police corps (Maranan) as they prepared to set out for Tegalreja (II. 14). The description of their arrogant posture

and cwirled black moustaches distinctly recalls the appearance of the gagah (forceful) male dancers in Javanese dance The battle scenes are also cast in a classical wayang manner: in the fight between the Macanan and Dipanagara's men at Tegalreja, for example, the latter are shown to prevail over their undisciplined adversaries (II. 12-17), in much the same fashion as the satria (warriors) conquer the flailing buras (giants) in the prang é¥émbang episodes in the wayang.* Even the humoristic interludes (Ganyolan), which are an integral part of all wayang performance, are to be found in this babad. One of rhese is the scene when the defeated

police official, Macan Laut, is deprived of his uniform by Dipanagara's bodyguards (III. 20-25).**

Introduction

These artistic and theatrical effects in the present text undoubtedly reflect the «car popularity of wayang performances at the Surakarta court in the early ":neteenth century. One of Pakubuwana VI's favourite banyolans, for example was reported to have been rather similar to the one reproduced in this text."? But it was Pakubuwana VI's grandfather, Pakubuwana IV, who was particularly renowned as a fear patron of the theatrical arts. Besides being an author of repute, he was also an «complished dancer and puppeteer (dhbalang)'' During his reign, Javanese war cances, such as the arrow-dance (beksa jebeng) and the fighting dance (beksa ~rsuireng), as well as the masked dance performances (wayang topeng) from the Panji cycle appear to have been especially popular. On certain occasions, the Sunan a:mself would take part in dance performances with a few of his close relations and he kept troops of prawireng and topeng dancers at court.!" Wayang kulit and wayang &:ztbik (shadow theatre with wooden puppets depicting plays from the Damar Wulan cycle) were also frequently performed. The former were so well liked that the offic:al wives of the Sunan used to play with diminutive gold and jewel encrusted wayang figures as a pastime." During an earlier period, when the Mataram rulers had been allowed to mint their own money, wayang gedhog (shadow puppets of the Panji cycle) and wayang klithik figures had even appeared on their coinage."

Wayang was not only popular at the courts. In the countryside too, performances were extremely well frequented: areas like Kedhu and Ledhok were renowned for their shadow plays and the European administration derived a substanual income from the taxes paid on wayang performances in government controlled provinces." In the Batavia-Bogor region, for example, wayang wong troupes were allowed to tour the countryside playing in local pasars and throughout Java performers and dhalangs wandered from village to village giving wayang shows."" The lacter, together with the seria Alana (wandering noblemen), caused the Dutch authorities particular concern during periods of agrarian unrest, for they often emerged as local leaders."" The tales which they performed of adventurers who had raised themselves to princely status fired the imagination of the rural population, especially the nw#mpangs (unmarried landless labourers), who earned a marginal existence as porters on the roads or as unofficial bodyguards of prominent courtiers."" The great popularity of wayang at this time can be seen too in the number of proper names and toponyms which were based on characters and places in the wayang."® At the same time, the use of Javanese orchestras which were played as an accompaniment to wayang performances, was also widespread. During the Java War, many chiefs who rallied to Dipanagara brought their own orchestras with them and select instruments, in particular the small cymbals (béndbe), drums (embur) and gongs, were used during battle engagements to strengthen the morale of their troops."" A beautiful example of this mixture of music, dance and the martial arts can be found in a European eye-witness description of Dipanagara during his flight from Tégalréja. This mentioned that the prince, who was dressed completely in

white and was mounted on a prancing horse, looked as though he was dancing (tandhak) in the midst of his lance bearing bodyguard.""

Although the wayang imagery used in the babad was primarily included to heighten the dramatic effect of many of the scenes, it also provides the main clue to the author's assessment of Dipanagara's character. Thus his choice of the wayang figure, Raden Samba, with whom to equate the prince, highlights his two main criticisms of Dipanagara: first the latter's close associations with the religious communities, and secondly the flaws in his character deriving from personal ambition

XXI

Babad Dipanagara

(pamrih). As he is portrayed in the Javanese shadow theatre, Samba is on the one hand a quintessentially courtly figure who would be out of place in the company of rural santris, and, on the other hand, he is a satria (knight) without any spiritual power (kasikten). A handsome figure and a fine talker with a good eye for women, Samba is nevertheless a devious and shallow character in the shadow theatre. On one occasion in the wayang rales, he is able to acquire spiritual power by virtue of a magical tattoo on his hand given to him by a pandbite (sage). As long as the efficacy of this tattoo lasts, Samba enjoys a period of real power and is able to conquer hitherto invincible ré&sasas (demons). But his glory is short lived. When the magical tattoo wears off, Samba returns to being his normal self again and his power is at an end."" By comparing Dipanagara with Samba, the author has therefore clearly indicated his view of the prince's character and his chances against the Dutch. According to him, Dipanagara would prevail for a while through the potency of the magic arts such as the powers of invulnerability bestowed on his troops (VIII. 15). But, as with Samba, his period of fame would be of short duration. His borrowed Aasékter would eventually loose its efficacy and he would become an ordinary person again, no longer of any consequence against the Dutch.

Much the same attitude towards Dipanagara can be seen in Cakranagara's Buku, where Dipanagara is likened to Suyudana, head of the Kurawas, a great ruler and a fine warrior, yet fated to destroy himself and his house because of his overweening vanity. In the same text, the author made it clear that, in his opinion, it was not the right time (durung mangsa) to drive the Dutch from Java and that Dipanagara's efforts were doomed to failure on account of his personal ambition (pamrih): a view which is still generally held today in Surakarta court circles." Needless to say the wayang figures which appear in Dipanagara's own autobiographical babad are very different, and it seems that he consciously modelled himself on Arjuna, the third of the five Pandhawa brothers, who is renowned in the wayang for his physical beauty and great spiritual strength.")

Just as the example of Samba was chosen by the babad writer to indicate his view of the prince's character, so the figure was also picked to stress Dipanagara's courtly origins and the incongruity of his connections with the santris. The author has thus taken pains to portray the prince in a noble environment. At the start of the babad, he is shown to live amongst his retainers at Tégalréja and Sélarong in a style appropriate to his rank (1. 16-17) and after the skirmish with Danureja's men outside his residence, he is portrayed distributing largesse in a manner which would have been expected of a nobleman (IV. 1-5). All these descriptions build up to the magnificent picture of Dipanagara before the fight with the Durch at Te&galreja, when he is compared directly with Samba (VIII. 21). Shaded by a state umbrella (payung) and mounted on a superbly caparisoned horse, the prince is shown to take little direct part in the fighting apart from his brief (and probably fictitious) hand-to-hand conflict with Wiranagara (IX. 19-25). Such an aloof position would again have been suitable for a person of high noble birth.** Furthermore, the babad writer found no difficulty in reconciling setria (knightly) and santri (religious) values by describing Dipanagara both as being dressed in the white raiments of the Holy War (prang sabil) and as having his symbol of princely authority, his payang, held over his head (VIII. 16, 21). The author even went so far as to qualify the latter as a symbol of

the Holy War (X. 28), a remark which underlined the highly syncretic kraton approach to Islam in general."

The emphasis in the babad on Dipanagara as a Javanese aristocrat had the purXXII

Introduction

pose of making his associations with the religious communities seem all the more incongruous. Thus the phrase which the babad writer put into the mouth of Resident Smissaert undoubtedly sums up the highly critical attitude of many members of the Javanese courts towards the prince's sentir connections:

II. 8. ......

It is a sham, his giving himself over to religion

9. and often going away to perform asceticism.
He is hand in glove with the santrss.
He has given up the sense of honour of the sarrias, for he has accepted the sense of honour of the sentris.

10. ......

He mixes with the scum of the nation (and) is arrogant enough to invite battle, but these sentris, what do they amount to?**

In the view of the babad writer and of numerous others in the Central Javanese kratons, Dipanagara had not been loyal to his caste. He had thrown over his obligations as a Javanese nobleman and had demeaned himself by associating with the sansris, most of whom were drawn from a rural background and had a very different social status from the courtly elite. The same attitude towards Dipanagara can be seen in Cakranagara's Bukx," and even aristocrats who fought for the prince, such as Ali Basah Prawiradirja (Sentot), maintained a critical view of the religious leaders who served under Dipanagara. Sentot's viewpoint was later epitomised by Dipanagara when he remarked that the young nobleman could 'neither read nor write and from his earliest childhood bad shown a violent dislike for Dipanagara's intention to educate him for the position of a 'priest' (sic).'** Indeed, Dipanagara and his family were to some extent unique amongst their kraton contemporaries ar this time because of the depth of their devotion to Islam and their numerous links with leading religious teachers and mystics.** We shall see below (pt. IX) how chis situation can be traced to Dipanagara's rather unusual upbringing at TEgalreja, some distance away from the Yogya court. Many of Dipanagara's santri associates later rallied co him at the start of the Java War (V. 1-15) and they were of considerable use in organising a following for Dipanagara at the village level. But their support eventually proved a liability to him. Irreconcilable tensions developed berween the prince's kraton and santri supporters over questions of landholdings, military tactics, the treatment of prisoners and the role of religion in areas controlled by Dipanagara.'" These difficulties, which effectively split Dipanagara's followers, hastened the prince's defeat at the hands of the Dutch, especially after Kyai Maja's defection in November 1828. The comments in this babad thus afford a useful insight into the deep-seated suspicion of

the religious communities in Javanese court circles and the impossibility of any lasting alliance between the two groups.

Besides his attack on Dipanagara's relationship with the religious communities, the author also contrived to introduce a histrionic note into his portrayal of

Dipanagara as an aristocrat turned religious leader. In various passages it seems that, with conscious irony, he was casting the Yogya prince in the role of a latter-day Prophet Muhammad. Thus Dipanagara's insistence that he wished to be driven away from the capital (Yogyakarta) and his demands of pledges of loyalty from his followers (I. 18-19), read as a burlesque of the Prophet's famous hijrah (flight) of the year 622 from Mecca to Medina. The same is true of the prince's decision to embark on the Holy War (preng sabil) against the Europeans and the Chinese in

XXIII

Babad Dipanagara

Java, which he is depicted as announcing in high-flown rhetoric (V. 1-6) and which seemed to emulate Mubammad's own declaration of the on the unbelievers in Mecca."! The historical example of the great Prophet of Islam may have been used

by the babad writer to offset what he viewed as absurdly histrionic gestures of Dipanagara's part and to attack yet again the pretensions of the santri.

Finally, it should be noted that the viewpoint of the author is throughout that of a Surakarta official and his attitude towards Yogyakarta is coloured by the long standing rivalry between the two courts. Thus, the author has incorporated various small illusions into his text to highlight the fact that, in his estimation, Surakarta was the senior court in Central Java and rook precedence over Yogyakarta. During the discussions in the babad about road building projects in the negara agung, for example, Surakarta is referred to pointedly as a nagari (state) as opposed to Yogyakarta which is dismissed as a mere kurtha (town) (VI. 6). In the same scene, Danureja, the

Yogya Patih, is also made to allude to his Surakarta colleague as Kang Mas Adipatya (my elder brother the Adipati), another recognition of Surakarta seniority (VI. 2021). Meanwhile, Danureja's initiauve in the matter of road construction is shown by the babad writer to have been grounded on an incorrect understanding of previous adat (custom) (VI. 4-7), so once again Yogyakarta is made to appear at a disadvantage.

In conclusion, the author's attitude in the babad with regard to Dipanagara, Yogyakarta and the Dutch can be characterised as a highly critical one. Although he evinced some sympathy for Dipanagara's stand against the European government, this sympathy was tempered by an unequivocal disapproval of the prince's serif connections and a censorious view of the prince's own character. Above all, he questioned Dipanagara's personal motives, and, by comparing him with Samba, predicted his ultimate defeat at the hands of the Dutch. The author's account is thus steeped in the prejudices and assumptions of a member of the Surakarta court, a viewpoint which can be seen most clearly in his treatment of the religious communities and his disparagement of Yogyakarta. This critical approach, combined with the highly contemporary nature and historical accuracy of the babad, makes it an invaluable source for students of this period. In particular, it is a useful text to set beside Dipanagara's own autobiographical hbabad, which gives his personal justificamon for his actions; the Yogyakarta kraton chronicle, which espouses the viewpoint of the Sultan's court, and the Buku KZdhung Kibo, which was written under the aegis of one of Dipanagara's most formidable provincial adversaries: Cakranagara 1 of Purwareja. The existence of these four Javanese chronicle traditions concerning Dipanagara and the Java War, provides historians with a unique opportunity to produce a balanced appraisal of the historiography of che period.

V. THE OTHER JAVANESE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS

V. A. Dipanagara's Autobiographical Chronicle: Babad Dipanagara

The most important of the four main chronicle traditions is that which was written under Dipanagara's orders in Menado during the first part of his exile in Sulawesi (1830-33). According to the dates given in the text, his account, usually known as the Babad Dipanagara, was composed in just under nine months (8 Besar, A.J. 1758 - 1 Ramelan, A.J. 1759, 20 May 1831 - 3 February 1832)."! In slightly over 1,000 folio sized pages, it covers the history of Java from the fall of Majapahit (c. 1527) to the peace of Giyanti (1755) (one third of the work), and the period of

XXIV

Introduction

Dipanagara's own life and times from his birth in 1785 down to his exile in Menado in 1830. No original manuscript of this babad is now extant, but in the 1870's the Dutch scholar, A.B. Cohen Stuart, made a series of copies of the manuscript owned by Dipanagara's descendants who were living in Makasar."! This family manuscript may well have been the original, as it was written in pegon (Javanese written in unvocalised Arabic letters), a script which was widely used amongst the more selfconsciously religious circles in Java and by Dipanagara himself."* But there is no means of checking its authenticity as it has now apparently been lost. ** The first copy made by Cohen Stuart, also in pegor script, and various other copies in Javanese script are, however, in the library of the Museum Pusat in Jakarta. Unfortunately the pegon copy, which is probably the most accurate for purposes of historical research, has been allowed to deteriorate so badly that many pages are now illegible and its use for students is at present limited."* The copy which is referred to in the present study is one in Javanese script which is now in the Leiden University Library and classified as LOr 6547 a-d. This four volume quarto transcription of the Bubad Dipanagara is from the collection of the late Professor G.A.J. Hazeu and closely resembles one of the copies in Javanese script in the Museum Pusat collection. The text of the Rusche edition of the last two thirds of Dipanagara's babad, first printed

in Surakarta in 1908-1909, also seems to have been based on a similar manuscript.""

According to Dipanagara, the idea of writing such an autobiographical account was first suggested to him by the Resident of Menado, D.F.W. Pietermaat (18261832), who had asked him about the reasons for his exile. The prince undertook to write the history of his life and times after he had made the Resident promise that he would deliver a letter to King William I of the Netherlands (1813-40) requesting permission for him to make the pilgrimage to Mecca (ka;)."* Despite this intriguing insight into the genesis of Dipanagara's babad, the fashion in which it was actually written down is 'still unclear. It is unlikely that Dipanagara himself was responsible for drawing up the work, for, although he was a fascinating talker, he wrote Javanese very badly.'"* Moreover, the only surviving manuscripts from his hand are in prose and not in Javanese tembang (verse)."" Instead, it is possible that Dipanagara may have sketched che outlines of his chronicle orally or in prose and then left it to an amanuensis to convert into tembang. This seems to have been the technique which was used later by Cakranagara when he wrote the Buku Kiedhang Kebo in the 1840's and many other contemporary Javanese babads were composed in a similar fashion at this time."! Dipanagara had with him in his entourage in Menado one of his brothers-in-law named Tumenggung Dipawiyana, who apparently wrote Javanese fluently in both pegon and Javanese script. and later (Aug. 18230) a scribe was sent from Tondano to help the prince. So either of these two men might have been in a position to cast Dipanagara's babad in terbang and compose the final version.** But there is nothing in the Dutch sources to confirm this and the Resident of Menado made no mention in his official letters of any literary activities on Dipanagara's part."}

Although there is very little firm information about the background to the composition of Dipanagara's autobiography, its importance as an historical source has long been recognised. The Dutch military historian, P.J.F. Louw, who drew on the babad extensively for his history of the Java War, wrote that 'unhesitatingly we would attribute such a high historical value to the babad of Dipanagara, that any history of the Java War could undoubtedly be branded as highly incomplete if it had

XXV

Babud Dipanagara

not used the babad as a source'." Louw made use of Dutch and Malay translations of the original manuscript which are often faulty®", and his main interest in the babad was in order to check the details of military engagements, in which field che account is the least accurate of all. But, even after detailed comparison with the available Dutch military reports, Louw still accorded the babad his highest praise: 'his (Dipanagara's) account is as far as we can judge an ingenuous one and can on most points not only ... sustain the control of European sources but ... it gives more than these'.** It is the opinion of the present writer that the babad is most useful for checking the details concerning the history of Yogyakarta before the Java War and Dipanagara's own activities in Tegalreja. Louw's historical appraisal of the work is therefore amply justified for this period and perhaps also for Dipanagara's view of events during the Java War itself. It cannot, however, in any sense be designated an 'ingenuous' source, for Dipanagara's prejudices and assumptions are clearly marked in the babad. In the political alignments in the Yogyakarta kraton, for example, Dipanagara supported his father (the future Sultan Hamengkubuwana III) against the party of Pangeran Natakusuma (later Paku Alam 1) and even against the followers of the second Sultan. The account thus reflects Dipanagara's highly personal and partisan view of the Sultan's court.

V.B. Cakranagara's Family Chronicle: Buku Kedhung Kebo

The second most important group of Javanese accounts about the period of Dipanagara, which are sometimes referred to loosely as Babad Dipanagara, are the various recensions of the Buku Kédhung Keto (chronicle of Kedhung Kebo').
Keéedhung Kébo (buffaloes watering hole') was the picturesque local name for the settlement on the Bagawanta river (Bagelen) which was later known by the more dignified coponym Purwardja ('the beginning of prosperity'). The original manuscript of the Buku was written under the orders of Raden Adipati Cakranagara I (183062), the first Bupati of Purwaréja after the Dutch annexation of the area in 1830." Cakranagara came from a family of prominent Kyaits (country gentlemen) in the Bagelen area and served for a time as Mantri gladhag, an ofhcial in charge of the porters' guild, in Surakarta before the outbreak of the Java War. His name at this time was Mas Ngabehi Resadiwirya and the first mention of him in the sources is in 1810, when, as a priyayi kipatihan (an official of the Pauh's office in Surakarta), he was sent to Ampel near Bayalali to investigate an irrigation question.** It is unlikely that he knew Dipanagara before the Java War, although there is an unsubstantiated oral account that the two men studied kebatinan (Javanese spiritual disciplines) together under the same grrr (teacher) just outside Surakarta." During the war itself, Cakranagara was ordered to return to Bagélen with a detachment of Surakarta troops. His duties there were initially those of a guide to the local Dutch commander, Colonel J.B. Cleerens, but he later made himself useful in military matters as well and in 1829 he replaced his Surakarta superior, Pangeran Kusumayuda. His exploits in the fighting against Dipanagara's forces in the area earned him the position of provincial head (Bupati) of the newly created kabupaten (administrative area) of Purwareja at the end of the war. In many ways he was typical of the 'new men', mostly provincial gentry, who were favoured by the Dutch in 1830 over the heads of the old court grandees like Pangeran Kusumayuda who had hitherto administered the outlying areas in the name of the Central Javanese rulers. As a 'new man', Cakranagara felt the need to justify his rapid rise to prominence, so, amongst other things (like the building of an impressive residence), he commissioned the Bué#z to illustrate his career in the service of the Sunan and the Dutch. The account of his life and times was

zu: nine introductory cantos are included which deal with Dipanagara and the -vents in Yogyakarta between 1812 and 1825. As a piece of literature the Buka is zot fine, since it is written in coarse provincial Javanese and incorporates many Malay words and idioms, which are used especially in the conversations between Dutch and Javanese officials depicted in the text. It cannot thus be compared in :'erms of literary style with the polished cadences of the kraton babads or even with the dignified simplicity of Dipanagara's autobiographical chronicle.

Cakranagara's position as an official of the Surakarta in the years nefore the Java War, meant that he probably had access to a considerable amount of information concerning political developments in Yogyakarta during the 1812-25 period. His colourful account of the fighting in the early weeks of the war, when he himself was still in the Sunan's capital, could likewise have been based on the reports which came back to Surakarta from the members of the Sunan's forces who served in Yogyakarta (see above pt. IV). But the Bwéw's insights into Dipanagara's character and motives are so detailed, that there is some doubt about how much Cakranagara himself contributed to the early passages concerning the prince and his <ircle at Tégalréja. Apart from the tenuous oral tradition of a érbatinan contact with Dipanagara, there is no other evidence to suggest that Cakranagara had any direct snowledge of the latter's life in Yogyakarta before the war. By a close comparative study of the introductions to the various manuscripts, however, it is possible to conclude that another auchor may have had a hand in the composition of the carly cantos. This second author has been identified as Ali Basah Péngalasan, a junior kraton official of the Sultanate prior to 1825, who later became a prominent army commander (Besah) of Dipanagara during the war. He appears to have been an intimate associate of the prince and was placed in charge of one of his elite bodyguard regiments which was recruited largely from seniris. It seems certain that Péngalasan was in a position to acquire close personal knowledge about Dipanagara and his circle of advisers both before and during the Java War. There is a strong possibility that he supplied Cakranagara with most of the details for the early cantos, whereas Cakranagara himself provided the material for the second part of the Buky which concerns the campaigns in Bagelen. The work thus represents an interesting example of co-operation between a bitter enemy of Dipanagara (Cakranagara), and a warm supporter and confidant of the prince (Péngalasan)."*

The earliest available manuscript of the Bués is LOr 2163 of the Leiden University Library which was completed in 1842-3." A Dutch translation of the introductory cantos which deal with the background to the war and the outbreak of Dipanagara's rebellion has already been referred to (see above pt. I and note 17).
This was published as long ago as 1860, but it cannot be regarded as anything more than a general summary of the text. Moreover, since the publication did not include a text edition of the original MS. (LOr 2163), its use as an historical source is

limited. For the purposes of the present study, the original Leiden manuscript has been used in conjunction with another manuscript copy of the Buky from the collection of the Koninklijk Instituut (Leiden). This MS., classified as KITLV Or. 13, has recently been the subject of an unpublished M.A. Thesis. The latter gives a full transliteration of the first nine cantos and a summary in English which greatly facilitates the historian's task."* Although the Koninklijk Instituut version dates from

V.C. The Yogyakarta Court Chronicles concerning Dipanagara: Babad Ngayogyakarta

The third main group of babads concerning the life and times of Dipanagara are those which were written at the Yogyakarta court in the late nineteenth century. In terms of historical importance, these should probably be placed in fourth place after Dipanagara's autobiographical babad, the Buku and the Surakarta kraton version edited in the present study, since they are the least contemporary. But they nevertheless contain a considerable amount of information and give a unique account of events from the point of view of the Yogya court. Various manuscript copies of this Yogyakarta chronicle tradition still survive. One can be found in che Widyabudaya manuscript collection of the Yogya kraton classified as Widyabudaya A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran), which appears to be a copy made in 1906." There are also other manuscript copies in the Sana Budaya Museum Library (Yogyakarta), entered as SB A. 135 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. 1), SB A. 136 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. I1) and SB A. 144 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. III), which cover the period from the accession of the second Sultan (April 1792) to the appointment of Raden Adipati Danureja V in February 1847.9 As these latter manuscripts were more readily available to the present writer than that in the Yogyakarta court collection, they have been used here, although a few references have been made to the Widyabudaya text for purposes of comparison.

The principal author of the Babad Ngayogyakarta was Pangeran Suryanagara, a son of Sultan Hamengkubuwana IV (1814-22) by the daughter of a court dhalang, Kyai Dhalang Jiwatenaya, who was the leading wayang kulit puppeteer of his time in Yogyakarta."! Perhaps Suryanagara inherited some of his grandfather's artistic skills, for he later became a well-known court poet (pxjangga dalem) in Yogyakarta and won a government gold medal in 1875 for Javanese literature."" He married into the Paku Alam family and maintained close contacts with Dutch military and scientific circles in Jakarta, being himself an honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the Dutch General Staff and a corresponding member of the Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap (Royal Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences). Suryanagara helped to develop a distinct Yogyakarta literary style, which used a literary idiom containing many kawi (Old Javanese) words unknown in Surakarta texts."* His main interest was in the history of the Yogya courts (the Sultanate and Paku Alaman) and he also acquired a

reputation for expertise in constructing chronogram lists (babad sengkala), although the latter has been called into question by a recent study of sengkala texts. °° The

unique feature of Suryanagara's Babad Ngayogyakarta volumes is that they include transcripts of official Dutch and Javanese letters from the period of the Java War some of which were taken from J. Hageman's history published in 1856.'" Suryanagara's work thus reflects a combination, which was extremely rare in Javanese literary compositions, in that it was based on both European and Javanese sources.

Suryanagara was helped in writing the final volume, which covers the period from 1826 to 1847, by Danuréja V, Patih of Yogyakarta (1847-79), who drew on

his own experiences of the Java War period to amplify the former's researches.
Danuréja V, who was then known as Ali Basah Mahmud Gandakusuma, served

Dipanagara throughout the war as one of his most trusted army commanders and remained loyal to him to the end. Thus, as was the case with Pengalasan and CakXXVIII

Introduction

rinagara, Danuréja was in a position to offer his co-author many personal insights .to Dipanagara's behaviour during the war which enhance the human quality of suryanagara's work. Similarly, for the first volume of the trilogy, dealing with the .vars 1792-1816, Suryanagara appears to have had access to interesting private sources in the library of the Paku Alaman. Indeed, this first volume bears a very close resemblance to the prose version of the babad attributed to Paku Alam I, known as the Babad Batawi, which was later used by C. Poensen for his study of the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II.!" This latter babad mainly concerns the events in Yogyakarta before the appointment of Paku Alam I in March 1813, and is written from a highly partisan viewpoint. By virtue of his marriage into the Paku Alam family, it is likely chat Suryanagara was able to use an original manuscript ssbon) of Paku Alam's chronicle which he recast in a more flowery literary idiom.
survanagara's babad in turn, probably served as the source for the prose version

sed by Poensen, which represents a much later recension of the Paku Alam account. !??

Apart from the insights provided by Danuréja V and the biases taken over from the Paku Alam babad, the main theme which ruas through Suryanagara's Babad N curogyakaria is that of the survival and continuation of the Sultan's court through a troubled period of war and rebellion. The events which led up to the Java War are Sealt with scrupulously, but much stress is laid on specifically kraton events such as marnages, deaths, court ceremonies, the visits of Dutch dignicaries and the like. It is perhaps in the context of these happenings at the Yogyakarta kraron, that the historian can find new light to shed on the figure of Dipanagara, for he is seen not as a central actor scheming a revolt as in the B#yk# or the present Surakarta text, nor as an incorruptible paragon as in the autobiography, but rather as just one of the many Pungerans at the Yogyakarta court at this time. Thus he is glimpsed as a rather dour ngure reading the éitabs (Islamic texts) at the Friday services (sales Jumzuwah) in the Great Mosque (Mesjid Ageng) of Yogyakarta, as a senior prince riding out to meet Governor-General Van der Capellen at Karangjati in 1819, and as a member of the Yogyakarta expedition sent out to help crush Pangeran Dipasana's revolt in February 1822." No really new facts are given about the causes of the Java War, but Suryanagara's babad is particularly strong on the events which shook the Yogya court at the time: the troubles over the ending of the land rent in May 1823, the influence of wandering dhukans (mystics; magicians) and the quarrel over a kraton pusaka (regalia). '°' Throughout the babad, the reader has the impression that he is nrmly based in Yogyakarta aad that, although Dipanagara is often mentioned, the events at Têgalrêja and the fighting which followed are explained from the viewpoint of the Sultan's court. The Babad Ngayogyakarta is therefore a most useful foil to the other Javanese historical accounts.

V. D. The Minor Javanese Accounts

V.D.1 The Chronicle of the Seizure of Yogyakarta: Babad Bìdhah ing Ngayogyakarta

Prominent amongst the minor Javanese accounts, which do not fall into the category of the Dipanagara babads and which have been referred to in the present study, is the Babad Bedhah ing Ngayogyakarta ('the chronicle of the seizure of Yogyakarta').
This babad recounts the events surrounding the attack on the Yogyakarta kraton by the British on 19-20 June 1812 and affairs in the Sultanate up to May 1816, when the young ruler, Sultan Hamengkubuwana IV, married a daughter of Danureja II.
The original draft of this babad, which bears the title Serat Babad Ngengreng kaping

XXIX

Babad Dipanagara

kalih (lit.: 'second draft of the chronicle") forms part of the John Crawfurd collection in the British Library (London) and is written on (Javanese treebark paper).
It seems likely that this unfinished draft was taken back to England by Crawfurd when he left Java in October 1816 after the restoration of Dutch authority on the island.'"** A copy of the British Library manuscript is in the Leiden University Library classified LOr 2045. Although the latter represents a more polished version of

the text, it has been bowdlerised and is incomplete, so all references in the present study will be to the draft in the British Library.'""

The author of the babad is not mentioned in the text, but it seems to have been written at the behest of Pangeran Panular, an uncle of Sultan Hamengkubuwana III (1812-14). Panular, who features prominently in the babad, was a staunch supporter of the third Sultan and a leading figure in the karajan or kanoman party at court.
This party, which was made up of those Yogya Pangerans and officials who adhered to the cause of Hamengkubuwana III and his son, Hamengkubuwana IV, was opposed to the followers of the banished second Sultan, who were known as the kasépuban party (the partisans of the old Sultan (Sultan Sepuh). The chronicle strongly represents the views of the former group and thus affords an insight into the party rivalries which were to bedevil court politics in Yogyakarta until the 1850's.'"9 Like Suryanagara's Babad Ngayogyakarta, the Babad Bedhah is very much a court text which deals in detail with minor kraton events and ceremonies. Dipanagara is often mentioned as a young prince closely associated with his father, the third Sultan, and the babad provides an interesting background against which to assess his activities during this period. Of particular use, as far as historians are concerned, is the fact that many of the opening verses of the cantos are dated, and that the cantos themselves bear the impression of having been written up at different stages throughout the reign of the third Sultan and the beginning of that of his successor.
These dates range from 7 Jumadilakir A.J. 1739 (19 June 1812) to 15 Jumadilakir A.J. 1743 (12 May 1816). Although the manuscript begins and ends abruptly, it has something of the nature of a court diary and can be said to constitute a highly contemporaneous source for the history of developments in Yogyakarta during a crucial period before the Java War.

V.D.2 Dipanagara's Makasar Notebooks: Sejarah Ratu Tanah Jawa and Hikayat Tanah Jawa Another important minor source for this period are the notebooks on Javanese history, legends and Islam which were written by Pangeran Dipanagara in Makasar and which are now owned by his descendants.'"" The notebooks are in pegor script and written on Netherlands-Indies government paper cut into small octavo sized sheets probably for economy. The first of these bears the date 5 Dulkijah A.J. 1765 (24 January 1838) and it is likely that both were written or dictated by Dipanagara about the same time.''" This was a period when Dipanagara was placed in rather strict confinement in Fort Rotterdam (now Benteng Ujung Pandang) in Makasar

because of the contents of some of his letters to Java. But he was still allowed to have writing materials and books.""

Both the notebooks are in prose and not fembeng (verse) and were composed in a curious Javanese style with many Arabic words and phrases. They may have been intended as reading material for Dipanagara's children born in exile, two of whom were just reaching boyhood at that time.'? The first book (175 pages), entitled

Introduction

Ratu Tanah Jawa (the history of the rulers of Java), deals with the history of lava and Javanese legends from Adam to the fall of Majapahit (c. 1527) and the coming of Islam. It thus appears to be a prelude to the historical survey at the beginning of Dipanagara's autobiography. But, whereas the latter follows a strictly chronological order, the first Makasar notebook is written in an anecdotal fashion with many digressions on diverse topics such as the wayang, legendary heroes and

holy sites. It is as though Dipanagara had set down on paper a series of lengthy conversations for the entertainment of his family.

The second book (245 pages), which bears the title Hikayat Tanah Jawa chronicle of Java), is undated and incomplete. Some of its pages have also been severely damaged by damp and insects. The introduction states explicitly that it was composed by Dipanagara, who referred to himself by the title he adopted during the Java War (Sultan Ngabdul Hamid Erucakra etc.).!!! The contents largely concern Dipanagara's disquisitions on Islam, his own religious expertences, SZf prayers used by the Nagshbandiva and Shattariya mystical brotherhoods (rarekar) and various meditation techniques. Diagrams (daerah) for the arrangement of Arabic words and breathing exercises during prayer are included as well as local Javanese ngelmu (mysucal traditions). The whole book is slightly reminiscent of a Javanese primbon (divining manual).

For the purposes of the present study, the books have only been referred to occasionally for they contain few passages of immediate historical relevance. But they nevertheless constitute an invaluable source, on a more general level, for an understanding of Dipanagara's historical perspective and his religious outlook. As regards the latter, despite an impressive display of quotations from the Qur'an, Dipanagara appears as more of a typical Javanese mystic and Swf than as an orthodox Muslim reformer.''* The use of dbiérs (short prayers for the glorification of Allah which are repeated in ritual order) and the ojrat form of meditation '' assume considerable importance in Dipanagara's view. The second Makasar notebook thus provides a rich collection of documentation for anyone wishing to understand the context of Javanese Islam in the early nineteenth century.

V.E. Malay Language Sources: Jayadiningrat's 'Sketches on the Java War'

One of the few Malay sources for this period is the series of notes made by the Bupati of Karang Anyar (Bagelen), Raden Adipati Jayadiningrat (1830-1863) in the 1850's. These notes were later entitled 'Sketches on the Java War' (Sehersen over den corlog van Java) by the Dutch historian, J. Hageman (1817-71) who added extensive annotations to the text. The original manuscript is in the Museum Pusat collection in Jakarta and is classified as Malay (ML) MS. no. 97.''* It was completed on 2 February 1857 and ruas to 114 folio sized pages. The text is written in common Bazaar Malay (pesar Maleis), the lingua franca used by Europeans and Indonesians in the nineteenth century, and has many Javanese expressions. The author, a son of the Yogyakarta prince, Pangeran Murdaningrat (killed 1826), and a grandson of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II. took part in the Java War on the side of Dipanagara but deserted him in 1829 and was appointed as Bupati of Karang Anyar by the Dutch government in 1830.''" His account of the war is haphazard, but he gives a fascinating picture of the social and economic pressures in the princely territories before the outbreak of the Java War.''* In particular, his figures on taxation and the examples of corruption by Chinese tax-farmers add a new dimension to the material

XXXI

Babad Dipanagara

available on this subject in the Dutch sources. Jayadiningrat's account appears to have been prompted by Hageman, who travelled extensively in Central Java between 1842 and 1854 to collect material for his book on the Java War.!!! According to Louw!2", Jayadiningrat waited until the death of Danureja IV in 1849 before writing his work because of his intensely bitter feelings against the Yogya Patih whose actions had done to much, in his view, to precipitate the war. By the time

the work was complete, Dipanagara had also died in Makasar (8 January 1855), and Jayadiningrat felt that he could express himself with less restraint. Despite its outspokenness, however, Jayadiningrat's acount does represent a somewhat biased viewpoint and ir is severely marred by the vulgar Malay idiom used in the text.

V.F. Prophetical Literature: Texts concerning the Jayabaya Prophecies and Messianic (Ratu Adil) Expectations

The prophecies of the legendary twelfth century King of Kedhiri, Prabu Jayabaya, are of particular importance for the history of the Dipanagara period."" Chiliastic hopes of a Ratu Adil (Just Ruler) who would arise after a period of moral decline, have been prominent at various periods in Javanese history, but they seem to have exercised a particular hold on the imagination of the Central Javanese population in the years immediately preceding the Java War. There is evidence in most of the babad sources and in some European accounts that Dipanagara and his contemporaries were aware of the Jayabaya prophecies as well as their relevance for the troubled times in which they lived.'"" Dipanagara's assumption of the title Erucakra, which is one of the names of the Rata Adil, at Selarong on 15 August 1825 (1 Sura, Wawu, A.J. 1753) clearly indicates that he saw himself as fulfilling the role of the Just King.'?? For the purposes of the present study various contemporary Javanese accounts of the Jayabaya prophecies have been selected to illustrate the extent of popular messianic expectauons before the Java War. The most important early nineteenth century work dealing with the prelembang, as the prophecies were known, is the Serat Cabolang which was probably completed in Surakarta in 1815.'"" There is also a fragment of a babad in the collection of the Netherlands Bible Society (on loan to the Leiden University Library), classified as NBS no. 37, bearing the title, Réréper Babad Dipanagaran (lyrical chronicle concerning Dipanagara) which discusses the relationship between the Jayabaya prophecies and the history of the Dipanagara period."" The fragment bears the dare A.J. 1742 (1814), which is probably erroneous as it was in all likelihood written after the Java War as an ex pos!
facte account. Finally, there are two commentaries on the prophecies and translations in Dutch and Malay which date from this period and were prepared for the information of Dutch officials and military officers. '?°

V. G. Javanese and Malay Letters

In order to round off this survey of the Javanese historical materials relating to the Java War period, mention must be made of the few collections of Javanese letters which have survived from these years and which have been referred to in the present study. Some of Dipanagara's letters and orders written during the war are in the H.M. de Kock private collection of the Algemeen Rijksarchief (The Hague). The letters in this collection mainly constitute intercepted correspondence berween Dipanagara and his commanders, reports of Dutch spies, and official communications sent by Dipanagara and other leaders to De Kock. Most of these documents are copies, but there are a few originals bearing the begon seal of Dipanagara.'"" Various transcripts of Javanese letters referring to the prince can also be found in the

XXXII

Introduction

. pies of Suryanagara's Babad Ngayogyakarta mentioned above (see pt. V.C.) They ire of doubtful originality, however, and it seems that Hageman, who was the s:urce of much of the correspondence used by Suryanagara, merely had access to

Dutch copies of the Javanese originals for his published work.'" Other original from this period can be found in portfolios LOr 2167 and LOr 2168 of the Leiden University Library. These appear to have been collected by the missronary sholar. J.F.C. Gericke, between 1827 and 1842 and some were later used by R: orda for his published collection of Javanese letters and charters which appeared 7 1845." Further publications of letters written by Dipanagara and his associates mere made by Louw, De Klerck and J.J. de Hollander.!?!* Meanwhile, some of the - »rrespondence berween members of the Javanese kratons at this time can be found 1 the two Leiden portfolios and in the private secretarial archive of the Sunan in he Surakarta kraton, known as the Sasana Wilapa.""' These usually concern rather

iry official matters, but they someumes provide information which is lacking in the ther Javanese accounts.

VI. THE EUROPEAN SOURCES

VL A. The Residency Letters

The sources in European languages (mainly Dutch and English) for this period are extensive and provide detailed evidence which can be used to check the Javanese iccounts. The most important category of European language source materials are the Residency letters and reports which were sent back by the Residents in Central Java to the colonial government in Jakarta.'"" Although some of these letters have Seen lost or destroyed, the Indonesian National Archives (Arsip Nasional) in Jakarta contain reasonably complete collections of Residency correspondence from Yogyakarta and Surakarta for the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (up to 1832) and for the Government of Java's Northeast coast until 1808. The Yogyakarta Residency collection has been used most extensively for the purposes of

the present study. The only period for which this collection is slightly fragmentary is for the five years of British rule in Java (1811-16), but this gap can be covered by additional sources in the India Office Library (London).""* Furthermore, the Dutch scholar of the principalities, G.P. Rouffaer, made copious notes on the Residency archives in Surakarta and Yogyakarta during his study tour in Central Java in 1888-1889 and these notes can be used to amplify the other sources.'"" Additional letters and reports pertaining to the administrations of H.G. Nahuys van Burgst, Resident of Yogyakarta (1816-22), and A.H. Smissaert, Resident of Yogyakarta

1823-25) can also be found in the Leiden University Library and in the archive of the Ministry of the Colonies in The Hague (Aigemeen Rijksarchief})."}" Both these collections contain documents which are not in the Jakarta archives. Of particular importance for the history of the outbreak of the Java War in 1825 are the letters in the H.M. de Kock private collection of the Rijksarchief. Amongst these papers, for example, is most of the correspondence berween the Residents in Central Java, Governor-General Van der Capellen (1816-26) and General De Kock dealing with developments in the area during the first crucial months of the war."" These letters have hitherto been little researched, for, although both Louw and De Klerck made use of De Kock's official correspondence in the erstwhile archives of the Dutch General Staff (KNIL) in Bandung for their history of the Java War, they did not

have access to De Kock's private papers which were only deposited in the Hague archives in 1905."}®

Babad Dipanagars

VI.B. Final Memoranda: Memorie van Overgave

The detailed reports on affairs and personalities in an administrative area drawn up by an outgoing Resident for his successor, known under the general title of Memories van Overgare (final administrative reports) also form a very useful source for the hisrory of developments in Central Java in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Four full-length Memories of Residents who served in Yogyakarta before 1808, J.M. van Rhijn (1786), W.H. van IJsseldijk (1798), J.G. van den Berg (1803) and M. Waterloo (1808), are still extant in the Jakarta archives and in Holland. '?
The very rich private collection of Nicolaus Engelhard, Governor of Java's N.E.
coast (1801-1808), which is in the Rijksarchief, likewise contains some important final memoranda which touch on the Central Javanese courts: namely the Memories of J.F. van Reede tot de Parkeler (1801) and Engelhard (1808) on the N.E. coast, and that of J.G. van den Berg (1806) on Surakarta.!** Additional copies of these reports by the Semarang Governors, including that of P.G. van Overstraten (1796), can be found in the archive of Java's Northeast coast (Java's Noord Oost Kust) in Jakarta.'*! After 1808, probably on the orders of Daendels, no further Memories encompassing the same degree of detail were drawn up, but both Pieter Engelhard {(Resident of Yogyakarta, February-November 1808/October 1810-November 1811) and John Crawfurd (Resident of Yogyakarta, 1811-1813/1814/1816) made notes on the Residency archives and left a succinct survey of prominent court personalities for their successors.!* After the restoration of Durch authority on Java in 1816, the practice of writing detailed Memorses was allowed to lapse still further, but the degree of expertise and knowledge of local conditions on the part of Dutch Residents in Central Java still remained reasonably accurate. This can be seen in the

prolific reports on the background of the Java War and the data on the Residencies compiled in the 18203."

VLC. Diaries of Events in Yogyakarta, July-September 1825

Two important diaries describing events in Yogyakarta after the outbreak of the Java War have survived. The first was written by the Assistant-Resident of Yogyakarta, P.F H. Chevallier (died November 1825), and is entitled 'Dag-Register van den Assistent-Resident van Djokjokarta inhoudende aanteekeningen nopens het gebeurde van den 16 Julij tot en met 5 Augustus 1825' (Diary of the AssistantResident of Yogyakarta containing notes on the events from 16 July up to and including 5 August 1825).'** The second was drawn up by the Belgian landscape artist and architect, A. A.J. Payen (1792-1853), who had travelled to Yogyakarta in June 1825 to oversee building repairs to the Resident's house and had been trapped in the Sultan's capital by the outbreak of the Java War and the subsequent siege of the city by Dipanagara's troops (20 July-20 September 1825). This latter account, which was composed in a curious French style with many Dutch and Flemish expressions, is entitled simply 'Voyage @ Djokja-Karta, 1825° (Journey to Yogyakarta, 1825) and covers the period from 27 June to 29 September.!" Both these diaries are of considerable help for the purposes of the present study, and the day to day reports which they contain can be used to check the details in the babad.
They are also highly critical of the incompetence of the senior Dutch officials and military officers in Yogyakarta at the time, especially the Resident, A.H. Smissaert,

whose actions did much to heighten the sense of disquiet and anxiety amongst the European

XXXIV

Introduction \ 1 D. Reports on Dipanagara

Many of the sources cited above refer to Dipanagara in some detail, but certain E_cropean language documents can be singled out in particular as providing an intizate view of the prince. The most interesting of these is the journal of Second eutenant J.H. Kaoerle, a German officer of the Netherlands-Indies army who served as an Adjutant of Governor-General J. van den Bosch (1830-33) and «companied Dipanagara on his journey into exile in Menado (30 April-20 June :830).!*7 A part of this journal has been published and an extract included as an appendix to the fifth volume of De Klerck's history of the Java War.!"* A similar acount of the prince was kept by Major FV.A. de Stuers when he escorted Dripanagara from Magelang to Batavia (28 March-9 April 1830) and this has been published in full by De Klerck.'*" Both these journals suffer from the fact that their authors could not speak Javanese fluently and had to communicate with Dipanagara raruy through Another document which gives a brief view of Dipanagara during the period of the Java War is the account of Lieutenant Paul Daniel Portier, military Adjutant (ordonnans) of the Surakarta Residency and Inspecr of birds' nest rocks at Rongkob in Gunung Kidul, who was captured by Dipanagara's forces in Pacitan in 1826.'""

VIE Official Decisions of the Governor-General

Amongst the more important official sources available to historians are the decisions + the Governor-General (besluiten van den Gonverneur-Generaal) in Council (in read) : e. in the presence of the Council of the Indies, Raad ran Indië) and out of Council sussen raad). The minutes of these decisions provide interesting informauon on administration and policy during the years 1816-25. Full indexes (klappers) are available in the archive of the Ministry of the Colonies (Rijksarchief) for the period 819-25, when affairs concerning the principalities were listed under the twin headngs of onlusten (disturbances) and inlanders (natives)! There are also a handful of secret decisions (geheim besluiten) of the Governor-General both in and out of Coun:l which concern crucial matters such as the appointment of new rulers and succession problems in the princely states."" It should be noted that the same decisions can be found in the archive of the Algemene Secretarie (General Secretariat of the Governor-General) in the Arsip Nasional (Jakarta), and that these are more compiete than the records in the Hague since they contain extensive appendices (bij«zen>. The latter usually consist of official correspondence or reports from Dutch Residents and Javanese Bupatis which had served as the basis for a particular decison and which were not sent back to the Hague. They are a source of great interest tor historical research.!!! "

For the earlier period of the British interregnum (1811- 16), the collection of Java Factory Records' in the India Office Library (London) contains the main decisons taken by the government in Jakarta.!!* Finally, for the Java War years, the routine decisions of the Governor-General can be supplemented by the voluminous materials in the Geheim en Kabinets Archief (Secret and Cabinet Archive) of the Ministry of the Colonies archive in the Hague. This comprises a complete collection of political decisions taken by the Governor-General, together with other relevant papers and reports, which were referred to the King and the Minister of the Colonies in the Netherlands. Dutch translations of Javanese letters and detailed memoranda by junior officials can sometimes be found in the bundles.'"*

Babad Dipanagara VI. F. The Published Sources

The published sources which deal with this period are scattered and incomplete.
Both M.L. van Deventer and P.H. van der Kemp made an attempt to continue the sixteen volume De Jong and Van Deventer series up to 1820, but the documents published by them are arranged haphazardly and afford a rather patchy overview of the years after 1811.'!* Van der Kemp's publication of the letters of Mr. H.). van de Graaff, a leading adviser of Governor-General Van der Capellen, is an exception, however, and gives a useful insight into the 1816-26 period.!"" During the Java War years, the official government gazette, the Bataviasche (after January 1828, Javasche) Courant published most of the main official war reports and these can be used to amplify the descriptions of the campaigns given in Louw and De Klerck.!!* Many of these official reports were later republished by Nahuys van Burgst in his four volume collection of documents on the Java War, which is a crucial source for the 1825-30 period. "° There are few published Javanese sources of relevance for the early nineteenth century. The Rusche edition of the Babad Dipanagara has already been referred to above (see pt. V.A.). Another useful published source is Soeripto's doctoral dissertation, Ontwikkelingsgang der Vorstenlandsche Wetboeken (Leiden, 1929), which provides much information on the progress of Javanese law

codification in Yogyakarta and Surakarta during these years. Other published sources are listed in the bibliography.

VII ORTHOGRAPHY AND TRANSLITERATION

The spelling of Javanese names and words in the present study follows the usage of the early nineteenth century wherever possible. Quotations from Javanese sources are spelt as in the original even when this involves forms which are no longer standard. Plurals of Javanese words have been formed by adding the English 's' or 'es'.
All Javanese terms appearing in the Introduction aad the notes to the text have been placed in italics except for those which have been used frequently such as babad, kraton, wayang, Patih and Bupati. Explanations in English and Indonesian Malay of the Javanese words can be found in the glossaries. The only significant departure from the orthographic standards used here is the name of the city of Yogyakarta. The latter form corresponds with current usage. Ngayogyakarta Adiningrat would be the correct formal style in early nineteenth century usage. But the current spelling has been adopted here for the sake of simplicity.

The system of transiiteration for modern Javanese follows the system proposed by the Congress of the Lembaga Bahasa Nasional (National Language Institure) in Yogyakarta in January 1973. Thus tja becomes ra, da becomes dha, dja becomes ja, ja becomes yz, nja becomes nya, ta becomes the, and only the pipet (2) is indicated.
This system of transliteration provides for greater facility as far as publication is concerned, although the use of dha and the raise problems with the aspirated dha and the which are used in Old Javanese and Sanskrit. Nevertheless, as the above system has now been officially adopted for Javanese language books and newspapers, the present author has considered it better to follow current practice.

Quotations from other languages (Old Javanese, Sanskrit, Arabic) also follow

currently acceptable systems of transliteration. Malay passages and Javanese texts written in pegon are transliterated according to the system for Javanese.

VIII. THE DATING SYSTEMS

Three systems of dating are used in this study. The Javanese lunar era from 1633, aruch is classihed as the Javanese era (Anno Javaeno: A.J.). The Islamic Anno Hijrae A H.) beginning in 622, which was sometimes used at the courts and amongst the *vagious communities, and finally the Christian era (A.D.). Whenever a date is given »:thout an indication of the era (A.H. or A.J.) readers can assume that it is a date tr m the Christian calendar. A table of conversions from A.H., A.J. and A.D. can -+ found in Encyclopaedia van Nederlandsch-Indie, vol. V (Supplement) ('sGravenhage, 1927), pp. 65-79 (#5: 'Tijdrekening'). It cannot be stressed tov highly as the Javanese thought in terms of the Javanese era (A.J.), and some members * the more self-consciously Islamic communities (including Dipanagara) thought in ~erms of the Anno Hijrae, these latter systems assume paramount importance for .ne Javanese view of history.

IX. DIPANAGARA AND THE JAVA WAR: AN HISTORICAL SKETCH!5!

Although the immediate causes of the Java War are reasonably well known and are realt with in detail in the present babad, the long term economic and social origins f the conflict have been hitherto ignored. These must be sought in the structure of zovernment and society in the princely states at the curn of the nineteenth century.
At that time the core regions of the principalities were economically prosperous, but burdened with an uneven taxation system, poor administration and widespread banditry. Foreign observers, who commented on Javanese agrarian conditions were most forcibly struck by the following interrelated phenomena: the rapidly burgeoning population, the opening up of new ricefields (sewa), the existence of a class of arge peasant proprietors (wong sikip), the numerous landless labourers (nempangs), the evidence of considerable local trade and the debilitating effects of the apanage organisations. '*'

Accurate population statistics are not available for this region until the late nineteenth century, but, on the basis of the number of r#cabs (households) recorded in the late eighteenth century land registers, it is possible to stipulate a minimum annual population growth of around one per cent for the period 1755-1805. During these fifty years the population of the principalities grew from 905,000 to about 1-4 millions and accounted for over a third of the total number of inhabitants in Java.'"? The increase in the core regions was probably much greater, however, for there was a net outflow of population to the Dutch ruled pesisir (north coast areas), where the annual growth rate was of the order of five per cent.'* This outflow was not accounted for in the land registers. The latter were also based on incomplete information regarding the size of landholdings, which local officials and farmers consistently under-estimated to the royal surveyors (abdi-dalem priksa dhusun) in order to avoid raxation.!** Demographers have not paid much actention to this period, but

it is likely that the steady expansion during these years laid the foundation for Java's

demographic explosion in the nineteenth century when the population quadrupled between 1830 and 1900.'"

The reasons for the population growth in Central Java in the late eighteenth century were fourfold. First, apart from isolated local disturbances, the area enjoyed seventy years of unbroken peace between the time of the Giyanti treaty (1755) and the outbreak of the Java War (1825). This was the first long period of tranquillity in Java for many centuries. Secondly, there were no large scale epidemics until cholera reached the island from India in the 1820's. The most serious endemic disease at this time was small-pox, which caused particular depradations amongst the young, hence its Javanese nickname lara borah (the children's ailment), but which never reached epidemic proportions because of the scattered nature of the population.'** Thirdly, the rural inhabitants of Java married young: the men at around sixteen and the women at berween thirtcen and fourteen. This was because marriage had distinct financial advantages. Women were generally recognised as being more dexterous than men in money matters and they would usually make an important contribution to the household budget by their marketing activities.! *?
Children also played a vital role in the Javanese peasant economy. Most cultivators would raise a family of between eight and ten children, half of whom would survive into adolescence. These would usually start work ar the age of eight: the boys being taught the rudiments of agriculture and the girls being giveo instructions in spinning and weaving. The latter would also take part in the transplanting and harvesting of rice. '"* Thus a large family was an advantage of a cultivator who had rights over more land than he could cultivate on his own account. Fourthly, the existence of adequate food supplies and the balanced diet of families in rural areas created a suitable environment for demographic growth by increasing local resistance to disease.
European officials of the time commented on the generally healthy condition of the peasantry, and, until the 1820's, most farmers were able to enjoy a mainly rice dier.'®" It was only in the years immediately preceding the Java War, that widespread droughts and harvest failures occurred in the principalities. These led to local famines, forcing peasants to depend on less nutritious secondary crops such as maize and cassava, as well as wild tubers and leaves, and it was precisely during this period that the devastating cholera epidemics occurred. But in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century such times of dearth were rare.''°

The rapid opening up of new ricefields in Central Java and the construction of extensive irrigation systems mirrored the steady demographic growth. In 1804, one Durch official reported that the increase in rice production was visible everywhere in the central regions: 'one has only to direct one's eyes to the lands which now produce rice', he wrote, 'and which twenty years ago were still waste and uncultivated'.'"' According to him, the amount of in the area around Yogyakarta had increased by 25% in ten years (1796-1806), much of this increase being due to the construction of dams and irrigation ditches on the various estates owned by the Yogya rulers.'"* These royal initiatives were paralleled in other regions by the exertions of local farmers.'"" By 1836, nine tenths of the available agricultural land in Mataram (the main province of Yogyakarta) was under cultivation, two thirds of which was sawah.'"* There even appears to have been pressure on land in some areas. In Kedhu, for example, Crawfurd noted in 1812 that greater use was being made of dry crop fields (¢égul) in the poorly irrigated central plain and that mountair rice (gogo) was being cultivated at ever higher reaches of the volcanic foothills su:

Apart from the rulers, who were viewed as the 'overlords' of all the territory in se princely states, the main beneficiaries of this rapid extension of irrigated riceland E Central Java were the small class of 'landowning peasants known as the wong -*? lit.: 'users of the land'). These were descendants of the original founding asmles of a village who had a stake in the sawah owned in common by the com=-rity. The village heads (/wrah) and local tax collectors (bekel) were usually drawn * <. this group. They also bore the full weight of the land rent (pzyèg) and corvee "egurements demanded by the rulers and the apanage holders (members of the Sulvan s family and high officials), who were given usufruct of land in the central dis=-wcrs. Below the sikep were the ngindhungs, who owned their own house and yard x: had no share in the village ricefelds, and the zumpangs, unmarried strangers, 30 lived in the compound of the sikep and performed agricultural and corvée serxes for him.'"? This latter group approximated most closely to a class of landless reasants in Java at this time. Unlike the ngindhangs, who could sometimes improve mer social position by marrying into sikep families, the raempangs had very little nance of raising their status unless they left the village completely and opened up zew lands elsewhere. But such opportunities were becoming increasingly rare after . 800. Some did try to break out of the cycle of rural servitude by taking employ=-ent as porters (baturs) on the main trade routes or by entering the service of afluential noblemen at the courts. Others joined the numerous bands of robbers and vagabonds who roamed the Javanese countryside. The majority, however, remained in the villages where they were used by the 'landowning' peasants for constructing new ricehelds.'"* These individually developed lands (tarah yasa) were the manstay of the sikeps' wealth, for, unlike the common village sawah or the other heirloom lands' (tanak pwsaka) handed down by the founding families, they were ikin to private property. Moreover, the tax burdens on these lands were often light or non-existent until the early nineteenth century, for the royal cadasters were seliom revised to take account of changes in land use at the village level (see 5elow.)!?9

In many rural areas the sikep; seem to have exercised substantial local influence by virtue of their extensive rights over land and their control over large numbers of iabourers. This situation was clearly recognised in Bagélen by a Dutch scholar who commented on the quasi 'patron-client' system prevailing in the province before the Java War.'*" Similarly in Kédhu, Crawfurd noted that each siéép laboured the lands which he had rented to his own advantage, shared very little property in common and only gathered together in village associations to have some mutual security in an insecure countryside. 'Culrivators who live next door to each other', he wrote, 'can be as distant and unconnected as if they lived twenty miles apart'.'"! The support of these 'independent' farmers was of great importance for Dipanagara during the Java War. On the one hand, they supplied the taxes needed by the prince to prosecute the war, and, on the other hand, their local influence over the rampangs ensured the recruirment of soldiers and porters for Dipanagara's commanders. The control of the rural population far more than the conquest of territory was thus the most crucial issue during the Java War, just as it had always been throughout Javanese history.
Dipanagara appears to have recognised this at an early stage in the hostilities. In 1826, for example, a village official who had come over to the Dutch, reported that Dipanagara appeared to be acting in a manner expected of a Javanese 'Just King'

XX XIX

(Rate Adil). He had made promises everywhere in country areas that if he gained victory he would only demand a maximum of four Spanish dollars on a jeng of land, regardless of whether the latter was 'fat or thin' (i.e. fertile or infertile).'*? The same attempt to secure popular support can be seen in Dipanagara's instructions to the provincial heads appointed by his commanders during the war. These prohibited changes in the existing irrigation systems or demands for additional taxes and instructed that any plundered goods should be returned to the owners on pain of punishment.'*} The threats were sometimes enforced: in 1829, one of Séntot's officials was flogged on Dipanagara's orders for demanding more taxes than he was allowed.'** But, by this time, the prince's local following was already on the wane.
The Dutch system of small fortified outposts (benteng stelse!), begun in 1826, which guarded areas in the plains recently 'pacified' by Dutch troops, had started to have an effect. Not only did they restrict the movement of Dipanagara's supporters, but the rural population also appear to have left the areas nominally under the prince's control to set up their pesers (markets) in the safety of the bentengs. Thus the money which Dipanagara's officials raised from the pasars, the market tax, which was their principle source of revenue, steadily dwindled and there were less resources available for the war effort.'** By the end of 1829 organised resistance to the Dutch in the fertile rice plains of Central Java was effectively at an end. Only a few commanders continued w hold out in the hills until Dipanagara's capture at Magelang on 28

March 1830, but without support from the rural communities their efforts were doomed to failure.

Although some of Dipanagara's success as a leader in the early stages of the war can be ascribed to his astute use of popular messianic hopes regarding the coming of a 'Just Ruler', other factors facilitated his efforts. Prominent amongst these was Dipanagara's own reputation as a careful administrator of his own lands in Yogya before 1825 and his ability in gerting on with the common people.'** As Willem van Hogendorp pointed out:'*"

'A special characteristic about Dipanagara in the view of the Javanese, who are

always extremely exalted and distant in their dealings between superiors and

inferiors, is that he consorts as easily with the common man as with the great ones and because of this he has made himself much loved everywhere.

This aptitude for mixing with all classes of Javanese society, which was a central part of Dipanagara's personal charisma, can be traced back to his childhood and upbringing at Tégalréja, his great-grandmother's estate just outside Yogyakarta.'** According to the description in his babad, he lived there in the midst of a rice farming community and associated freely with visiting rural sentris;'"°

Moreover, unlike many members of the courtly elite, she did not eschew trade."" Towards the end 0:

her life, she became especially scathing of the pretensions of her son, the second Sultan, whom she is supposed to have addressed in the following terms on her seathbed (18 October 1803):!" "Sultan! The path which I have to lay aside is difficult, and now 1 feel that 1 am no more than the ordinary people. My son, be conscious of that and do not believe that after your death you are anything more than a common coolie (datar). So live accordingly!
Dipanagara thus grew up under the guidance of a remarkable lady and in a unique environment which brought him into contact with a wide range of different people.
He was also personally endowed with the qualities of leadership: in Knoerle's words, 'the Pengeran ... appeared as a noble (and) ... proud man, gifted with intelligence, a strongly enterprising character and a penetrating judgement, such as is rarely found amongst high placed Javancse'. These impressions were echoed by many other Europeans with whom Dipanagara came into contac;.'?"

Quite apart from Dipanagara's personal attributes as a leader, the existence of widespread rural discontent on the eve of the Java War, made it much easier for him to appeal for popular support. Responsibility for creating this agrarian unrest was due as much to the actions of the Central Javanese rulers themselves as to the demands of the European administrations after 1808. Ja Yogyakarta, one of the earliest measures to have profound effects in the countryside was the second Sultan's pancas revision of 1802, whereby the size of the units of land (#rgs) in his dominions was diminished whilst the tax and corvée obligations on each jung remained at the old level.'"" The aim of this fiscal expedient was to tap some of the new wealth in the countryside represented by the extensive new ricehelds opened up by farmers in the late eightcenth century. But, since the measure was not based on a revised cadastral survey (the last had taken place in 1773-4) and the Sultan did not dispose of enough village surveyors, it fell unevenly on fertile and infertile areas. Furthermore, it tended to sharpen the inherent differences in the tax burdens on individual jungs, which were already fixed in a most haphazard fashion by the apanage holders and the sovereign. In the lands around Nanggulon in the Kulon Praga area, for example, which were administered directly by the Durch government between 1833 and 1851, surveyors later found huge discrepancies both in the size of the and in the amount of land rent (pajeg) levied on each jusg, with no obvious connection being made between the population density, the fertility of the soil and the level of pajeg payments.'"" These imbalances probably helped to encourage the internal migrations of cultivators away from areas of high taxation to those regions where the burdens were lighter. Burt ultimately, the tax paying peasants, the siképs, had to bear the brunt of the fiscal discrepancies for all the sovereign's new revenue demands were passed on to them by the apanage holders. Those who had profited most from the construction of additional sawah, thus found many of their gains cancelled out by the heavier tax burdens. Although the individual reactions of the sikeps at the time are not recorded, it is certain that much of Dipanagara's rural support later came from 'landowning' peasants who saw him as a liberator from fiscal oppression.
Indeed, if any one single issue should pointed out as having prepared the ground for the Java War in Yogyakarta, it would be this ill-considered pancas revision by the second Sultan in 1802.

The administration of the tollgates (bandars) in the princely territories was another factor which gravely exacerbated agrarian discontent before 1825. Although historians have usually laid the blame for the deleterious effects of the bandars at

XLI

Babad Dipanagara

the door of successive European governments after 1812, the origins of many of the most oppressive features of the tollgate system can be traced back to the Javanese rulers themselves."" According to Crawfurd, no customs' duties had been levied on

internal trade in the principalities prior to 1755, when Sultan Hamengkubuwana | (1749-92) signed the first tax farm lease of the bendars with the Head of the Chinese community (Kapitan cina) in Yogya.!** The original tollgates grew up after the mideighteenth century at wayside resting places (Pesanggrahans) situated a day's journey

apart on the main trade routes. These were frequented by Chinese merchants, some of whom bought the right from the Kapitan cine to levy a small toll from other

travellers for looking after their belongings overnight. Gradually a fully-fledged bendar was established run by Chincse tollgate keepers, often with a local market attached. Then, as the Chinese became more familiar with the surrounding countryside and greater pressure was put on them to pay higher tax farm rents, smaller posts (rangkahs) were set up in adjacent country lanes. Until, just before the outbreak of the Java War, there was a tollgate at 'the entrance of nearly every village and hamlet in Central Java'.'""

The rate of proliferation of the tollgates can be gauged from the level of the tax farm at various stages berween 1755 and 1825. This tripled during the first Sultan's reign and by 1811, a year before the bandar: and pasars were taken over by the European government, the farm stood at four times the original sum.?** Some of the increase reflected the intensification of commercial activicy in the principalities, but even before 1811, Dutch officials were giving warnings that the collgates were interfering with trade. The quantity of bulk goods, especially rice and salt, traded along the Sala river between Surakarta and Gresik was already declining in 17962"! and the gedbong sembakan (tobacco warehouses) in Kedhu, which levied customs' duties on the export of Kedhu tobacco to the north coast, were hampering the vital commerce in tobacco, a major cash crop of the local peasantry." Most serious of all, the rollgates in the core regions (negara agung) had led to an increase in the price of foodstuffs in many areas. This was particularly the case in Yogyakarta which was dependant on rice imports from southern Kedhu to feed its population."" Times of dearth and high rice prices such as occurred during the 1820-25 period, thus made the Yogya area much more suscepuble to agrarian unrest than a region like

Surakarta, which could supply itself from its own hinterland and where provisions were relatively cheap.""*

After 1816, the effects of the tollgates became much worse. The restored

Dutch government was in desperate financial straits and needed every scrap of additional revenue. Thus, the toll farm in Yogya which had remained approximately unchanged under the British administration (1812-16), was tripled by 1824. At the same time, the sales of opium through Chinese tax farmers increased fivefold partly because of the greater facility of imports from Bengal after the lifting of the British blockade in 1811." The effects of these increases in terms of human suffering in the principalities were considerable. Farmers could not even journey to a local market without passing through a tollgatre and the percentage levied on common goods such as fruit and vegetables was nearly always high because there were no fixec duties on the produce of peékarangan (orchards).""" Attempts to evade the tollgate: were usually unavailing, for the bendars kept spies on cross-country routes and exercised the right to impound a farmers' goods or buffaloes in the event of nor payment.""" They also frequently maintained their own 'private armies who we:: used both for protection and for exacting retribution on recalcitrant villagers. In Ju.

Te amount of localised violence in rural areas before the Java War shaped wogmas atutcudes to armed conflict."} In many ways Java at this ume was still a soc<= are; for warfare and military endeavour. The Central Javanese rulers conmerc: tv demand armed levies from their apanage holders, and full reviews of sere held on state occasions such as the or at times of crisis such as Letes smack on Yogyakarta in 1812." Villages were required to maintain their :s stacks of armaments, and cultivators were usually well versed in the handling of Javanese weapons such as clubs, pikes and slings (Gendbil)."'* Women were also trained in military skills. Ac the courts, both rulers had their own female noecr@cards, the 'Amazon corps', who were recruited from the daughters of provinzx astscials, and some of the female dances (Bidhays and S¥rimpri) were based on ngawraz movements." This expertise in military matters at all levels of Javanese later proved of immense value to Dipanagara during the Java War. Thus a Ach officer described how villagers would often leave their fields and fall on a rxtue column which had been worsted in a battle with Dipanagara's forces, and meze is evidence that women fought as active combatants.?'° At the time of the wege of Yogyakarta in August 1825, the body of a woman dressed in male fighting coerume was found amongst the and at least two wives of Javanese noblesez who rallied to Dipanagara emerged as army commanders. One of these, R.A.
Y asakusuma of Munéng, a daughter of the second Sultan, apparently led the attack ze the Chinese community at Ngawi in September 1825, and when she eventually to the Dutch with her family in 1828, it was noticed that, like other supporters of Dipanagara, she had shaved her head as a pledge for the Holy War (prang

Pr FOL

Besides the support afforded Dipanagara by the rural communities and women, here were other important groups who ensured the prince a widespread following.
Prominent amongst these were his own family relations from the Yogya kraton and a large number of high officials of the Sultanate who brought over their own retainers.?!'° Both these groups had suffered substantial losses in landholdings due to the sweeping annexations of territory in Central Java by the European government after 1812. At the same time, the introduction of a putative European estate economy in the principalities between 1816 and 1823, together with the hasty cancellation of estate leases in the latter year, which involved large cash indemnities to the planters,

XLII

Babad Dipanagara

had also played a part in impoverishing the nobility and the leading officials.""° For many, Dipanagara's rebellion seemed to offer an opportunity to recoup some of their losses and to make good marriages with members of his family. The prince clearly encouraged these hopes by attempting to create an alternative administration and the semblance of a new kraton. Thus, he bestowed royal titles on close family members and used many of the administrative ranks which had earlier been employed in the Sultanate. In most cases, the incumbents of these posts created by Dipanagara stemmed from families who had served the Yogya Sultans in a similar capacity."" Many of the Yogya elite on Dipanagara's side were also rather young: the average age of the fifteen Yogya princes who joined him was 34 as opposed to the average age of 50 of the fourteen other Yogya Pangerans who remained in the kraton. Those appointed as commanders (A/ Basah) by Dipanagara were even younger: Séntot was a senior commander at eighteen and there were others in their early twenties.""" Youthful qualities were valued by Dipanagara. In his words, 'bravery was less met with in old men than in persons of a young age'. The younger scions of Yogya families were also those who had suffered most from the impoverishment of the kraton community before 18253?) It was only when it became evideoat that Dipanagara would not succeed in establishing himself and would be defeated by the Dutch, that the kraton elite reluctantly began to abandon his cause.""

Another interesting feature of Dipanagara's relationship with his family and court supporters is that he permitted the latter a considerable degree of independent action in outlying regions. The Java War, therefore, took on the aspect of a series of provincial uprisings loosely co-ordinared and controlled by Dipanagara and his advisers who remained mainly in the Mararam area of souch central Java. This aspect is clearly brought out in the present babad whete the prince is described dispatching letters to his supporters outside Yogyakarta and summoning allies such as Pangeran Serang and Tumenggung Kertadirja to receive their commands at Sclarong.??5 On the whole, however, the proxy campaigns waged against the Dutch in the north coast areas and the eastern outlying provinces were short-lived: by the end of 1825 both Serang and Kértadirja had been defeated in East Java and the region only became a theatre of war again for a short period in 1827-28.225 The western mancanagara areas, on the other hand, proved much more constant in providing support for Dipanagara, and even in the last years of the war, when the

prince's military position was desperate, he was sull able to find bases in Bagélen and L&dhok.22?

This discrepancy berween the reactions to Dipanagara's rebellion in the eastern and western outlying provinces of the Sulranate was largely determined by historical factors. Whereas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the states to the west of the Mataram heartland had been absorbed peacefully into the Central Javanese polity, the provinces around Madiun and further to the east had only recognised Mataram's authority after prolonged warfare.*" Even in the eighteench and nineteenth centuries the eastern mancanagara retained a measure of hostility and independence from the Central Javanese rulers. The first Sultan, for example, tried to ensure the loyalty of the region by appointing his most trusted army commander, Raden Rangga Prawiradirja, the champion of Sokawati, as the senior administrator (Bupats wédana) in Madiun."*" But the distance from Yogya meant that the local officials had considerable freedom of action.

A rough survey of the available Javanese and Dutch source materials indicates =» there were about 186 'men of religion who afforded Dipanagara help at some waar during the Java War. Many of these derived from the religious hierarchy in 't. gvakarta and from the pradiken (tax free) villages and religious schools in the Mataram area. Another large group was brought over by Kyai Maja when he joined early in the war. These included members of Maja's extensive family as weil as many of his students (santri) who had attended his pesantren in the Pajang ava to the west of Surakarta. Amongst those whose titles can be clearly identified were 108 Kyais, 31 Hajis (returned Mecca pilgrims), 15 Seks (Islamic scholars), 12

tled in the predikan villages, engaged in farming and local trade and had been affected by the agrarian crisis of 1821-25. Others depended for their livelihood on court pensions which had contracted severely over the same period."" The Java War thus seemed to offer them the chance to improve their social and economic position. Dipanagara's leadership was particularly important in this respect for he had maintained close associations with the religious communities from his youth and appeared to be aiming to establish a state in which they would enjoy more political power than they were permitted either under the Dutch or under the Central Javanese rulers. Kyai Maja's role as Dipanagara's principal religious and political adviser between 1825-28 also assured the santris a key position in the prince's administration. Thus religious scholars were chosen principally for the elite bodyguard regiments and some were given control of lands and villages in areas loyal to Dipanagara.!3*

Additional factors influenced the religious communities in the years immediately preceding the Java War. First, the attitude of Christian Europeans, especially government civilian and military personnel, towards Muslim Javanese appears to have been disdainful and Second, government actions against respected religious teachers in Central Java, aroused considerable local resentment.?*° Third, and perhaps most important, the legal reforms introduced by Raffles in 1812 and continued by succeeding Governor-Generals, were viewed by santris and even by the court elite as an unjustifiable infringement of the sovereignty of Javanese-Islamic law."! The combination of these three factors helped to reinforce a sense of common identity in the face of what the religious communities undoubtedly saw as 'persecution' on the part of the European government. This was doubly dangerous since it occurred at a time when closer relations with the heartland of the Islamic world in Arabia, through pilgrimage and Arab immigration into Indonesia, were imbuing Javanese Muslims with a greater sense of the power and glory of Islam.""

Dipanagara's declared intention of 'raising up the high state of the Islamic religion in Java' (mangun luburipun agami Islam ing Tanah Jawa sadaya), which was probably prompted by Kyai Maja, epitomised the hopes of some Javanese at this time for a return to the exercise of Javanese-Islamic law based on the precepts of the Qur'in and other legal commentaries':" On a wider level, Dipanagara's endeavours were directly concerned with Javanese political independence and cultural autonomy. Hence his insistence in 1830 that the Durch should return to their eighteenth century position as traders on the north coast and should not involve themselves with the internal political affairs of the princely states.'** Hence too his emphasis that European prisoners should adopt Javanese dress and that they should use Javanese (preferably krama), rather than Malay, in all their conversations.'*" In many ways Dipanagara was a conservative, deeply concerned with the cultural integrity of Java. He also made a genuine attempt to bind very disparate elements of Javanese society to his cause and in this sense he was probably the first 'nationalist' leader in modern Javanese history. But there were many internal contradictions about his style of leadership and his attempt to embody the aspirations of the rural communities, the kraton elite and the santris.*** Ultimately, there was bound to be a conflict of interest between the various groups, especially between the nobility and the 'men of religion'. Indeed, it is a measure of the depth of the social anc economic discontent in Java at this time and the strength of cultural and religious fervour that the alliance was able to hold together for so long.

Open rebellion against the Dutch and their supporters in the Yogya court is gecimmec ins Dipanagara makes a direct appeal for help during the coming conflict «@ i~-2i Dipanagara's scribes are then summoned and the prince orders them to weme secters to incite the disgruntled elements in Yogyakarta: the Arcus (robbers), yeermurzsciy dismissed administrators (Bupati dhongkol) and other embittered offama * 22-24). At the same time, Resident Smissaert is depicted holding a meeting wat bis Dutch and Javanese administrative colleagues in which the question of amgqronag some of the side roads around the Sultan's capital is discussed. One of #rese is planned to cross straight through the middle of Dipanagara's estate at Tegalwe» andi markers are duly placed across the prince's territory along the trace of the sew road. When this happens Dipanagara is absent at Sélarong (v.25-26).

He ascertains from the captain of his bodyguard (Lurah Kapedhak) that the markers meve been placed by an orderly from Danuréja's office and two Dutch road overXLVI

seers. Whereupon, he orders his estate workers (Magzrsari) and bodyguards (Kapedhak) to tear out the markers. News of this action reaches the Assistant Resident of Yogya. P.F.H. Chevallier, and he reports at once to Smissaert who falls into a towering rage and gives vent to his feelings about Dipanagara (v. 1-6).
Amongst other things, he enveighs against the prince's contacts with the religious communities (sentris) and his neglect of his responsibilities as a guardian of the young Sultan. In conclusion, he orders Chevallier to send out the Macanan, police officials, to Tégalrèja to replace the markers in their former positions (v. 7-11). The Assistant-Resident complies and the Macanan corps are described as they set out for Dipanagara's residence (v. 12-16). Once at Tegalreja, they immediately begin replacing the torn out markers. Their actions are reported

to Dipanagara who instructs the Magérsari and Kapedhak to rip out the markers again from behind the group of Macanan and to resist them if attacked (v. 17-20).

Canto 111

This they proceed to do, but they are noticed by the two Dutch road overseers

attached to the Macanan work party who inform the head (Lurah) of the corps, Macan Sembawa. The latter tells his men not to use their weapons but to beat off

Dipanagara's followers with staves and clubs. The Macanan are then depicted making these weapons and one member, Macan Laut, thinks about the booty he plans to seize in battle (v. 1-8). A fight between the Macanan and Dipanagara's men then takes place which is portrayed in very stylised terms. The better training and discipline of the Mag#rsari and Kapédbak gives them the upper hand (v. 9-17). The police officials, meanwhile, begin to have the worst of the battle and many lie crippled on the ground. Their Larak, Macan Sembawa, comes forward as a picked champion to defy Dipanagara's men, but, at this point, the babad wricer appears to confuse him

with Macan Laut who, far from seizing any booty, is himself stripped bare and humiliated by Dipanagara's supporters (v. 18-25).

Canto IV

Dipanagara, who had been watching the fight from an adjoining hillock and had hugely enjoyed secing the discomfture of the Macanan, gives out rewards to his followers (v. 1-5). The defeated Macanan and the Dutch road overseers beat a hasty retreat to the Yogyakarta Residency building. There the overseers relate the events at Tegalreja to the Resident and his Assistant, who become so besides themselves with rage that they are depicted in their wrath like kasar (unsefined) characters in the wayang theatre (v. 6-12). Danuréja is summoned to the Residency anc

he orders one of his Muntris (junior officials) to escort the Macanan back to his residence (the kepatihan) (v. 13-14). Smissaert once again convenes a meeting of z.
the senior Dutch and Javanese officials in the capital to decide what further meas ures should be taken against Dipanagara. Smissaert and Chevallier counsel hars; measures against the prince, but Danur#ja advances a more moderate and cautic«s

policy. He suggests that co-operation and support from Surakarta should be elicite: under the pretext of co-operation over road building projects in the two kingdom:

If Dipanagara then persists in his obstinate attitude, in Danuréija's opinion, he will -e faced by the combined opposition of the two courts, Surakarta and Yogyakarta :

On its arrval, Smissaert instructs Danureja to take the appropriate action. Yogya officials &= road overseers are then sent out in the direction of Magelang and to the west of the capital (v. 14-15). The discussion about Dipanagara and his opposition to the "sad construction at Tegalreja is resumed. Once again Danureja is shown advancing zoderate and sensible advice. He suggests that the prince should be summoned to the Residency in order to discuss the road building issue. Amidst scenes of conviality the meeting breaks up and on Monday 18 July 1825 the officials convene again at the Residency (v. 16-26). Two office orderlies from the Aipatihan are dispatched to Téegalréja in order to summon Dipanagara, but he refuses to comply (v.
27-31). Danuréja continues to counsel moderation and patience, and advises the dispatch of further messengers to invite the prince to come to Yogya. The following

XLIX

Babad Dipanagara

day, the officials meet again at the Residency, but, although Dipanagara has by now

received four separate summonses, he still refuses to come. The elderly Mangkubumi is instructed to go to T&galr&ja to win over the prince (v. 32-36).

Canto VII

After Mangkubumi's departure, the Dutch and Javanese officials await his return impatiently and view his long absence with concern. Danurtja urges them to be patient and to convene again the following morning in order to discuss the dispatch of an expeditionary force to Tégalréja, in case Mangkubumi did not return (v.
1-4). The following morning, Smissaert and Chevallier canvass opinions about the right course of action to be taken and Danuréija urges that a clear response should be obtained from Dipanagara. Thereupon, Sindunagara, a high Yogya official and two Dutch orderlies are dispatched to Tégalréja to take Smissaert's final message (v.
5-11). The scene changes to Dipanagara's residence where the prince is described entertaining his uncle, Mangkubumi, and two other relations. Mangkubumi warns his nephew that if he does not comply with Smissaert's request and go to the Residency, his estate will be attacked. Perceiving Dipanagara's weak military position, Mangkubumi advises him strongly against any resistance which might bring him into conflict with the Yogya court and the Dutch. He cities various examples from seventeenth and eighteenth century Javanese history to support his argument, but Dipanagara replies in a cold, succinct fashion, dismissing his uncle's warnings and leaving everything to the Almighty (v. 12-18). Shortly afterwards, Sindunagara and the two Dutch orderlies arrive at Tégalréja and humbly present Smissaert's final letter to Dipanagara. The latter then waves aside the Resident's request in a haughty

speech full of insulting expressions. Sindunagara and his companions depart amazed and dumbfounded (v. 19-26).

Canto VIII

Once Smissaert has been informed about the prince's reply, he immediately plans to

take charge in person of the expedition against Tegalréja. Danuréja, however, urges that a more appropriate leader should be chosen. The commander of the palace

guard, Wiranagara, is dispatched to parade the court regiments in preparation for the expedition (v. 1-7). The Javanese troops are then described as they set out for T&galreja alongside the Dutch soldiers commanded by Chevallier. One of the regimental commanders, Surabraja, is particularly singled out for his swashbuckling appearance (v. 8-12). At Tégalréja, Dipanagara rallies his forces in preparation for the expected Dutch attack. Arms are distributed and the womenfolk, children anc older retainers are sent away to Sélarong. Dipanagara's followers are drawn up in battle formation. The prince himself is portrayed in a courtly fashion like the wayang character, Samba, but wearing the apparel of the Holy War (a turban, anc long white tabard). His horses are paraded in front of him (v. 13-22). The scene changes to the soldiers of the palace guard commanded by Wiranagara, who are taking part in the expedition against Tégalréja. Some of these troops are describe: deliberating amongst themselves as to the justice of attacking Dipanagara. The regmental commander, Surabraja and other Javanese officers, concur with their sent ments and decide to express their doubts to Wiranagara (v. 23-28). The latter ;; approached and questioned about the true reason for the attack on Tegalreja. T: officers even threaten insubordination if Wiranagara does not give a satisfactoanswer. Hearing this, Wiranagara falls into a rage and uses threats towards Sur: raja. A fight nearly breaks out and the officers fire on Wiranagara with their pis:

decides to send out spies to ascertain where Dipanagara and his followers vive gone. The spies go as far as Bantul to the south of Yogya where they learn trom the local inhabitants that the prince has regrouped his forces at Sélarong (v.

In Yogya, Smissaert is told of the events at Tegalreja at a meeting which is attended by the senior Dutch and Javanese officials (v.
~-12). Paku Alam is also present accompanied by most of his personal standing army ('Legion'). Inevitably Smissaert falls into a rage, but once again Danureja counsels moderation and suggests thar, rather than send out an immediate expedition against Selarong, messengers should be dispatched to Surakarta and Batavia to inform the relevant authorities about recent events (v. 13-20). Letters are written

Li

Babad Dipanagara

and dispatched by fast couriers. The scene changes to Sélarong where Dipanagara is described ordering his scribes to write letters to his sympathisers on the north coast and in other areas in Central and East Java asking them to take part in the Holy War. Pangcran Serang, an independent prince from the north coast area, and Tumenggung Kertadirja, a dismissed Bupati from the Sokawati region, are appointed as army commanders in their respective areas (v. 21-30). The bestowal of these commands at Selarong is described and various supporters of Dipanagara are raised in rank. Dipanagara changes his name to that of Panembahan Tuwan Seh Ngabdulkamid and a loyal religious supporter, Kyai Taptajani, is placed in charge of Dipanagara's followers from the religious communities (v. 31-35). Bartle orders are drawn up for Dipanagara's commanders in distant areas and petty tradesmen are instructed not to sell their wares in Yogyakarta so that there will be a dearth of foodstuffs in the capital. Numerous other army commanders are also portrayed taking up positions in villages around the capital (v. 36-38).

Canto XI

The village levies who rallied to Dipanagara are described. The babad writer refers to these by the deprecaung term of brendbal (freebooters). Inside Yogyakarta, fires

are started by Dipanagara's supporters, many buildings are burnt and a heavy pall of smoke covers the town (v. 1-6). Meanwhile, Smissaert's messenger arrives in

Surakarta. The Sala Patih, Sasradiningrat, and the Resident, MacGillavry, are informed of the tragic turn of events in Yogya (v. 7-12). The Surakarta court offcials are then instructed by the Patih to assemble ar the meeting place (paseban) on the northern great square (#/wn-alun) before the Surakarta court. Two senior officials are delegated to go into the kraton to inform the ruler, Sunan Pakubuwana VI, about the developments. The latter thanks them in a succinct fashion (v. 13-16).
MacGillavry then writes a covering letter to Smissaert's reports and the whole bundle is sealed and sent on ro Semarang and Batavia (Jakarta) (v. 24-25). Simultaneously, Lieutenant Portier, a military adjurant of the Residency, is detailed to go to the mountainous southern province of Gunung Kidul to bring in two recalcitrant Yogyakarta and Surakarta officials. At the same time, Sasradiningrat arranges for guards to be placed around Surakarta (v. 26-29).

Canto XLI

Three days later, Lt. Portier returns bringing the two Gunung Kidul officials who are put in prison. In Semarang, the Resident, H.]. Domis, receives the bundle of letters and reports sent on by MacGillavry (v. 1-4). He calls a meeting of his Residency council who all peruse the letters. Domis then asks the Bupati of Semarang, Raden Adipati Aria Cakranagara, about the measures which should be adopted ro ensure

security in the Semarang area. Cakranagara suggests that the boundaries of the Residency should be patrolled and that travel passes should be issued to everyone circulating in the area. He concludes by adding a penetrating analysis of the very different characters of Dipanagara and Mangkubumi (v. 5- 16). Domis is impressed by the Bupat's arrangements and the letters are sent on to Batavia by fast courier iv

7-21). In Yogyakarta, meanwhile, Smissaert is described holding an audience with the Yogyakarta Bupatis. All the Dutch officials present feel uneasy about their own.
personal responsibility for the current state of affairs. Danuréja refuses to offer an: further advice to Smissaert until the messengers have returned from Batavia .
22-28). Smissaert then decides to administer an oath of loyalty to the Yogya o:cials, who are invited to the Residency office for this purpose (v. 29-30).

''! Thus the introduction to the Yogya text (Widyabudaya MS.

The MS. used by Poensen, LOr 5765, has been discussed by M.C. Ricklefs in his article, 'On the Authorship of Leiden Cod. Or. 2191, Babad Mangkubumi', BKI, vol. 127 (1971), p. 265. The authorship of the Babad Batawi was attributed to Paku Alam 1 by Ki Hadjar Dewantara, see his Beoefening van Letteren en Kunst in het Pakoe-Alamsche Geslacht (Djokja: H. Buning, 1931), pp. 13-14. It describes the events leading up to Paku Alam I's and his son, R.T. Natadiningrat's (later Paku Alam 11), imprisonment under Daendels in Cirebon (Jan.-May 1811) and their subsequent exile in Batavia and Surabaya under Janssens and Raffles until Dec. 1811, hence the title of the work (on these events see Poensen, op. cit., pp. 221-271) Dewantara's assertion is plaumble for it is known that Paku Alam 1 was a litidrateur of distinction and that many writing materials were found amongst his baggage in

Cirebon, see Dj. Br. 39, P. Engelhard to Danuréja I1, 5 May 1811.

'*3See Ricklefs, 'Authorship', p. 265. The fact that the Poensen text is in prose strongly suggests that it is a later copy.

""Before the European government's take over of the roligates and markets in 1812, certain pradikan villages had been exempt from tollgate dues and market taxes. see KITLV H 696g (Rouffaer papers). trans. of 'Gold Farm Letter, 1 Sawal A.J. 1734 (2 Dec. 1807). It is not certain whether this privilege continued after 1812, but if it did then the religious communities may have been shielded to some extent from the harsher aspects of the tollgate and market tax farms. For references to religious scholars and Hajis who received pensions from the Yogya court in c.
1820, see Louw, vol. I, p. 592. The total pensions to court santris and members of the 'priestly' bodyguard regiments had declined from Sp.D. 833 in 1814 to Sp. D.

of Kyai Maja were appointed as administrative officials in the Pajang area during the war,

see Knocerle, 'Journal'. pp. 24-5.

*3%3See Knoerle, 'Journal', pp. 14-15; something of the religious communities' sense

of outrage can be seen in Dipanagara's remark: 'that no matter who should be given preference between Jesus and Mubammad, the spirit of patient endurance was to be found more in the Qur'In than in ...
(Christian) ... works. Muslims had included much of the teachings of Jesus in the Qur'an ... (and) they also considered Jesus a man chosen by God (and) born from the breath of the Almighty. (But) ... Christians on the other hand soiled the Divine Sending of Muhammad with contumely and sought to show the Prophet as an imposter.'

Voyage', entry of 13 Sept. 1825 on.a captured Dutch dragoon who had been forced to wear Javanese clothes.

""One example of this is Dipanagara's admiration of Sultan Agung (1613-45) whom he described as a 'spirirual man who did as I did travelling around everywhere (on local pilgrimages) and as 'a great Islamic ruler who had established the nve pillars of Islam' (see Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p. 17). Yet it was precisely Agung who was the first Mataram ruler to effectively curb the power of the spiritual rulers of Giri tin 1635) and was the most energetic proponent of centralisation. He

was thus hardly the sort of ruler who would have appealed to the religious communities.

The Javanese year was two,

fifty.

2. We now change the tale.

His Highness the Sultan

of the kingdom of Yogyakarta.

the fifth, was still young.

His Highness was five years old'.

The Sultan received guardians,

four were established".

The first guardian was his grandfather,

who was called Pangeran Mangkubumi.
He had control of the Kadipaterr ,

3. (and) was the head of the Sultan's family in Yogyakarta Adiningrat.

The second guardian

was the uncle of the Sultan

who governed all inside the coun:

men and women

within the court deferred

to Pangeran Dipanagara'.

Whereas. the third guardian was the leader of the officials in Yogyakarta.

4. He governed all outside the court,

the high and low in Yogyakarta.

The Sultan's Nayakas*

did not wish to oppose

Raden Adipati

Danuréja'. All his wishes

were carried out.

Furthermore, the fourth guardian

held the final authority in exercising justice

in the law of fixed punishment and retaliation®.

There were changes in the direction of the state

Tegalréja, the residence

practising asceticism in the cave of Secang.

He stayed in peace there for three nights.

No one accompanied him,

except for three punakawans**.

Pangeran Dipanagara

soon returned to Tegalreja.

who were led by two Dutch road overseers**.

À. They did not heed my (angry) restraint, (but) forcefully (carried on) placing markers." Pangeran Dipanagara

was extremely wroth at heart

all of them so that none should remain.

Secretary Chevallier heard

all the markers,

"e dressed himself, (took) a carriage, (and) reported to the Residency house.

Hendrik Smissaert was just then

of Mr. Chevallier. He (Chevallier) sat down in front of him (and) spoke slowly.

He kept his hat under his arm

iand) stuttering forth rather nervously (said): "I wish to inform you

that all the markers

across Tegalréja have been torn up

6. by Pangeran Dipanagara,

not one remains standing.

Besides, the other

markers along (the road)

have all been thrown away."

When Hendrik Smissaert heard

the speech of Chevallier.

he hurled down his pen (and) slapped his thighs,

his eyes stared forward redly (and) his eyebrows bristled.
7. Mr. Smissaert said:

"Eh. Chevallier. I consider that Pangeran Dipanagara

cannot be treated in a graceful fashion, for long I have noticed

that his thinking seemed strange.

He is searching for a pretext

as he wishes to oppose the Government'®.
so the markers have been used as a beginning.

8. He is hiding something (although) he is in the open.
he crouches low (but) is seen. He gives the impression of being an egg-saint,

(all) yellow inside**.

Macan Sembawa made a sembah.

acquiesced (and) departed immediately

of the red bintulu design"",

with (kris) handles of the Balinese style'?

(and) gayaman sheathes.

Their bebeds"* (and) head-dress were both

of dark purple (and their) moustaches were darkened and twirled.
{They were) big and tall, in their actions like giants".

15. They did exactly as they wished.

Their duty was to make the rounds at night (and) make tours inside the capital.

They kept an eye out for evil folk

(and) during the day they prohibited

people (who played) gimér, képlek and kubuk© .
Because they were old hands at the trade,

if the alarm sounded",

at the first kenthung (thump)®" a Macanan would arrive,

16. {and) at the third kenthung,

the Macanan would descend like drizzle

and young Macanan® (cubs) all at once

would be ready to gather evidence,

in high spirits,

as if they expected to encounter

gold coins,. dinurs. a dhacin (in weight)".

Soon (the Macanan) arrived

at Tegalreja (and) they all placed the markers together.

17. These were all lined up

in conformity with the previous trace,

no different from before".

Those placing the markers set to it noisily.

When the Pangeran heard

the clamour and tumult,

he immediately sent someone to investigate.

The person sent said in a gentle fashion,

making a sembah. his face as though touching the ground:

Now they were given as companions (other Yogya) Pam ons kind) Maniris. and (the Dutch read exetseers).

Previously at Tégaliréa I wanted to make a good road,

18. (but) Pangeran Dipanagara did not permit it.
Nay, up till now

he still stands firm.

Should I cancel it?"

The Raden Adipati said:

"If it is cancelled it will be seen badly by people,

19. . subsequently orders will not be respected.
It is no good forgiving him.

(But) if it is carried through

it will surely come to a dispute.

The Pangeran has already retreated abashed.
It is an unimportant matter which

is discussed in terms of war.

20. We are not waging war to seize money, women or land.
it is not like that.

If it comes to battle.

a road will be the issue

(and) the victory will not be a reason for rejoicing.

Soldiers will die

(for something which) is not of the slightest value !*".

21. If you permit it. please summon the Pangeran to report to the Residency.

If he comes.

ask him what

would be the best road

through Tegalreja

even if it curves slightly!?".

22. If it might be enough for a guarding circle to be built around the capital,

(then), Sir. excuse the Pangeran's offence.

But perhaps if (the plan) is not to your liking, Sir, please. I offer it (humbly) in both my hands."

Wiranagara

Stow was the speech

of Pangeran Mangkubumi:

"Ah. my beloved nephew,

If you do not come.

13. - Tegalréja will not fail straightway

to be visited by Dutch

and Javanese troops, (and) they will all cocrce you (by force of arms), my boy.

It will not fail to come to war

against the people of the whole state

of Yogya.

What will you do to protect yourself?

(For) I observe, boy, that you are still weak, (and) do not have equipment.

14. - It is hard (and) difficult for a man to wage war, one should not make light of it, my boy;

clothes must be got together.

(and) first of all the army

must have enough food and victuals.

{And) they must be assured forgiveness

Secondly (you must be) wealthy in money.

The people of Pathi were murderously fought.

In the end

your great-grandfather made peace

with the Dutch (and) received half the state.
That is why. my son.

17. whatever you may do. Lord, don't go so far, boy, as to be the enemy of the Dutch. It would be (too) heavy to bear.

And moreover your ancestor who was raised formerly as Sultan

had already promised on oath

that he would not allow

the use of treacherous behaviour

to the Dutch." The Pangeran said this with tears starting from his eyes.

18. Pangeran Dipanagara said calmly:

"If you are afraid to oppose

the Dutch. from now on

once and for all become (my) enemy!"

Pangeran Mangkubumi was silent

observing his nephew's

great wrath.

He resigned himself to his fate, leaving everything to God.

Not long afterwards someone came to make an announcement,.
performing a sembah before him:

19. "Lord. there are visitors outside,

Mas Tumenggung Sindupraja'** accompanied by two Dutchmen."

The Pangeran said pleasantly:

"Summon them to come in immediately!" He made a sembah in agreement (and) left.
Already (the guests) were ushered in.
Tumenggung Sindunagara

and the two Dutchmen sat down on chairs.
(Sindunagara) spoke slowly

20. . with his hands clasped in front of him'": "I have been sent by

his greetings to Your Lordship

78

The letter was received (and) read atientively right through to the end.

21. After it had been read, (Dipanagara) quickly handed it over to his uncle,

saying slowly:

"Here my Lord!"

Pangeran Mangkubumi recerved

the letter. After he had read it,

he was startled at heart.

Pangeran Mangkubumi said:

"It is up to you what you write in reply,

choose (one of) the two courses."

22. Pangcran Dipanagara said calmly: "Sindunagara, my reply is this;

tell the Resident

that as concerns his calling me.

even if he waits till the roads turn to mud'", under no circumstances would I be willing

to enter the Residency.

If the Resident wants

to bring an army complete with weapons of war to mistreat me,

23. no matter whether. he orders or does not forbid (it), life (and) death will certainly not occur

(for) they are at the discretion of the Lord Allah.

If Smissaert pretends

that he can ordain life and death

(and) not Allah the Almighty,

then in my view

the Dutch have evil hearts

(and) are not fitted to exercise law and justice.

(Go) quickly (and) tell that

24. to the smooth bald-headed one''"! In my childhood people used to make me afraid when giving an order,

(but) all this bragging

about going to war is just idle talk.

Now I am not cowed any more.

Quickly Sindunagara

tell him that I

will just await him here.

If it comes to battle the hald-headed one will be disappointed if 1 am not present (too)!"

25 - Both Dutchmen sat staring in amazement,

neither could speak.

Then Sindunagara swiftly

begged permission to depart.

Hurriedly they went on their way,

three in number inclusive of the Dutchmen.

On horseback hastening along

at a gallop, they soon arrived

al the (Residency) office. All the Navakas were waiting.
Sindunagara spoke,

26. informing them about everything:

beginning, middle (and) end, nothing was omitted from the Pangeran's replies.

All of them were brought to the knowledge

of the Resident, Mr. Smissacrt,

(who), when he heard the words

of the Mas Tumenggung,

was exceedingly angry as though he had been slapped; his face was hot, glowing with wrath,

tand) his heart was afire.

CANTO VIII

|. Hendrik Smissaert said

to the Raden Adipati:

"Now the wish

of Pangeran Dipanagara

is that I myself should command in battle, for if I delegate it to any other person

"Here I am still as perplexed as a young buffalo.

I do not differ from you.

27. come on! Let us refer for orders to

"Why are you fleeing so fast

It is as though you should be respected

You want to show off your official zeal by adhering closely to the Government.
Come back, you fool!"

Major Wiranagara

"They would serve a madman!"

40. - Surabraja then

stopped pursuing the Major (and) straightway discussed with his comrades

the officers (thus):

"What do you think my comrades?

Let us go over to the Pangeran

41. If I do not go over,

your Major will not fail to find a cat's-paw.

He does not count the spilling of blood,

Adipati Danurêja was amazed to see him.

He was invited to report about

45. the reason he had fled.

He spoke clearly without onissions (or) additions.
(Then) Mr. Smissaert said:

"What now Raden Adipati?

Who should follow up the expedition

of Mr. Chevallier to Tegalreja

to reinforce him in battle?"

46. The Adipati said:

"With your permission, I will invite

"Sir. as to what happened to me".

the Pangeran and his army

attacked our lines.

I fought against them in battle.

the fighting was lively, many enemies and companions were wounded.

2. We were separated (when) the moon set.

It became pitch dark,

so that we could not distinguish enemies from friends.

Both sides retreated.

I received a wound,

I know not where the enemy came from.

The Pangeran and his army.

the survivors from those killed,

went to the south-west sounding the war-alarms along the road.

3. Where the Pangeran was heading I am not exactly clear,

(but) it is up to you. Sir,

if you wish to dispatch spies."

The commander Chevallier

replied in a friendly fashion:

he took off his hat.

(and) thanked him three times.

He summoned an orderly courier.

4. Upon (the courier's) arrival, he received instructions to track down

the Pangeran and his army

(and find out) where they were halting on the way, (inquiring) from village to village.

Mr. Domis was extremely nervous.

handed the letters over

to Raden Adipat:

When he had finished reading them.

Mr. Domis said to Raden Adipati

Aria Cakranagara: "What is your advice Raden Adipati?

10. What is the custom of the Javanese officials if there is such a case"?

It is up to you, Raden (Adipati),

to send out orders

to the Javanese in the Semarang

area and the environs

which are under the authority of Semarang"?*."

11. (Raden) Adipati

Aria Cakranagara acquiesced (saying):

"But indeed my request

is that before there are instructions,

from his Excellency (the Governor-General), all four directions

at Semarang must be guarded.

12. The Javanese must mount guard,

but the commanders there

should be Dutch preferably.

The armed men should be on guard day (and) night {and) patrol the main roads.

If there are any people passing

who are of a suspicious nature, they must be seized;

13. (but) if the people circulating

carry a letter showing their destination (i.e. a let them go on their way.

Sir. it is customary with the Javanese,

that small in war is the fairness:

ruses, deceit

and artifices are used first.

14. (The Javanese) are not like Government people who are straightforward night (and) day

(and) are happy if in the thick of baitle,

(and) defeated (or) victorious remain in order

and do not practise artifices.

But with the Javanese it im customary

to use tricks? 5".

17. - Resident Domis was content at heart when he heard the speech

of Raden Adipati

He gave it careful consideration

and much of it looked attractive.
Immediately he gave the order

Tumenggung Danunagara.

Sindunagara

The Resident's heart

was sad like torn up cempaka Nowers***,

24. and Secretary Chevallier was visibly uneasy in his heart.
The interpreter Dietrée

was in a perpetual panic thinking of all his mistakes, all kinds of wrong-doings which he had done formerly.

25. When he balanced them up he was fearful,

considering that the well ordered state

of Yogya was heading for destruction.

He was saddened (and) shuddered, but did not show it

to the public. (His secrets) had been revealed

(and) made apparent before his numerous enemies.

He was broken-hearted, overwhelmed (and) in a desperate state.

Danuréja. speaking softly: "What do you advise elder brother Raden Adipati? **?

ada alasan supaya saya

dapat pergi dari negeri.

Mudah-mudahan saya akan diusir

oleh suatu tentera yang besar

(dan) Tegalre;ja akan penuh (dengan perajurit-perajurit), (sebab) walaupun saya akan pergi dari negeri,

lebih baik kalau itu disebabkan perang.

Terserah-lah kalau kamu sekalian mau tolong saya,

CANTO II

1. Pangeran Dipanagara sedang berada di Selarong untuk bersemadi di Gua Secang.

Hingga tiga malam dia di sana dengan tenang.

Tidak ada yang mengawal dia

selain daripada tiga abdi pengiring.

Pangeran Dipanagara

pulang dengan cepat ke Tegalreja.

Waktu dia melihat tonggak-tonggak calon jalan berderet-deret,

158

Babad Dipanagara

2. dia memanggil ketua dari Kapedhak.
Sang Pangeran bersabda dengan lemah-lembut: "Siapa yang membuat bangunan disini?" Yang ditanya menyembah (dan berkata): "Dulu seorang yang disuruh oleh Raden Adipati Danureja dengan kerani dari pejabat (Residen), Gusti, yang dipimpin dua tukang jalan Belanda.

3. Mereka tidak mengindahkan perintah-perintah saya, tapi dengan paksa memasang tonggak-tonggak." Pangeran Dipanagara sangat marah di hau (dan) menyuruh supaya tonggak-ronggak dibongkar semuanya, jangan sampai ada yang ketinggalan.
Para Magersari dan Kapedhak berduyun-duyun membongkar (tonggak-ronggak ) bersama, bertaboran, sehingga habis semua.

4. Waktu didengarkan oleh Setiausaha Chevallier bahwa Pangeran Dipanagara sudah membongkar semua tonggak-tonggak, dia berpakaian, (naik) kereta (dan) melaporkan diri ke bangunan keresidenan.

Hendrik Smissaert baru saja sedang duduk di kursi di serambi umur.

5. Dia sedang menulis di suatu meja kecil (dan) terkejut atas kedatangan Tuan Chevallier. Dia (Chevallier) sudah duduk di mukanya (dan) bersabda perlahan-lahan

dengan agak gugup dan tergagap,

sedang topinya di bawah ketiak:

"Saya ingin memberi tahu

bahwa semua tonggak-tonggak

sepanjang (calon jalan) di Tegalreja sudah dibongkar

6. oleh Pangeran Dipanagara.
Tidak ada satupun yang masih berdiri.
Apalagi tonggak-tonggak

159

10.

Indonesian Malay Transiation

lain sepanjang (calon jalan)

sudah habis dibongkar semua."

Hendrik Smissaert waktu mendengar

laporan Chevallier,

membanting penanya, memukul pahanya,

matanya kelihatan merah (dan) kedua keningnya berdiri.

. Tuan Smissaert berkata:

"Heh Chevallier, saya menganggap bahwa Pangeran Dipanagara

tidak dapat diperlakukan dengan baik.
Sudah lama saya melihat

bahwa semua pikirannya kelihatan aneh.
Dia sedang mencari alasan

sebab mau melawan Kompeni,

jadi tonggak-tonggak digunakan sebagai alasan.

. Dia sedang menyembunyikan sesuatu (walaupun) dengan terang-terangan;

dia membungkuk ke bawah tapi dilihat. Dia memberi kesan dari seorang wiku endhog (pandita palsu),

di dalam berisi kuning.

Selama saya menjadi

Residen tindakan dan

tingkah-laku Pangeran itu

(menunjukkan) bahwa dia tidak suka dengan kami.

Dia hanya berpura-pura gemar agama

dan sering pergi untuk bertapa.
Dia erat sekali dengan orang ulama:

kehormatannya sebagai seorang satria sudah hilang

sebab dia sudah menerima kehormatan orang ulama.
Dia sendiri tidak sadar

bahwa Seri Sultan masih muda.
Mengapa dia tidak ikut sedih hati atas kekacauan negara?

Dia (merencanakan) mau mogok dengan pemerintah Hindia-Belanda.

Tapi pasti tdak akan mampu

kalau dia mau menentang Kompeni

(dan) memusuhi (pemerintah) Hindia-Belanda.
Saya sudah lihat bahwa Sang Pangeran

belum punya perajurit-perajurit

dan perlengkapan-perlengkapan untuk pertempuran teratur.
Dia berteman dengan sampah masyarakyat

(dan) menyombong diri untuk mengajak perang,

tapi kaum ulama itu, apa harganya?

Eh, Chevallier, besok

memberi perintah supaya tonggak-tonggak dipasang lagi

oleh anak-anak Macanan dari Danurejan

dengan dua kerani (kantor Residen)

(dan) para tukang jalan Belanda.

Satu tonggakpun tidak boleh ditinggalkan

(tapi) memasang (tonggak-tonggak) di tempat-tempat yang lama, jangan sampai ada berubahan apapun dengan dulu."

Tuan Chevallier mengemukakan persetujuannya,

turun dari kursi,

naik kereta (dan) pulang.

Malamnya tidak diceritakan.

Waktu pagi dia mengirim utusan untuk memanggil Raden Adipati

Danureja. Setelah (Danureja) datang,

dia diberi perintah

(dan) dipesan untuk pasang tonggak-tonggak lagi.
Raden Adipati Danureja kemudian memerintah

pegawainya, ketua dari Macanan,

yang namanya Macan Sembawa (sebagai berikur): "Heh, kamu, Macan Sembawa

dan semua sahabat-sahabatmu,

memasang tonggak-tonggak

di Tegalreja (lagi) dengan kuat."

Macan Sembawa menyembah,

mengemukakan persetujuan (dan) langsung berangkat dipimpin oleh kerani dan tukang-tukang jalan.

Dia mengambil seorang ketua kampung dengan para askar, tiga puluh orang dari (golongan) Macanan

Tugas mereka adalah untuk meronda pada waktu malam (dan) berkeliling dalam kota.

Orang-orang jahat diawasi oleh mereka

Sebenarnya mereka sudah berpengalaman,

Tegaireja (mereka) memasang tonggak-tonggak bersama.

(Tonggak-tonggak) diaturkan lagi dengan tali

sepanjang (calon jalan) seperti dulu,

calon lama tidak diubah.

Yang memasang tonggak-tonggak beramai-ramas.
Waktu Sang Pangeran mendengar

suara rioh dan ramai itu,

dia langsung memerintah (seorang) untuk menyelidiki.
Yang diutus berkata dengan lemah-lemburt,

sambil menyembah, mukanya seperti menyentuh tanah:

"Gusu, suara ramai itu

(dikarenakan) para tukang jalan Belanda

dengan orang-orang Macanan

dari Danurejan yang mengiringi mereka.

Mereka sedang memasang tonggak-tonggak bersama, dengan diaturkan dengan tali sepanjang (calon lama).
(Tonggak-tonggak) yang sudah dibongkar

dulu, sekarang ditanam lagi."

Pangeran Dipanagara berkata dengan keras:

162

Babad Dipanagara

19. "Heh, anak-anakku, para Kapedhak dan Magersari, segera membongkar dari belakang semua (tonggak-tonggak) yang sudah ditanam (lagi).
Jangan sampai ada satupun yang ketinggalan.
Jika kamu sampai dipukul membalas pukulan itu.
Kalau kamu ditusuk, membalas tusukan itu. Demikianlah pesan saya!

20. Jikalau Sang Residen dan Danureja (sendiri) yang mengerjakan pemasangan tonggak-tonggak itu, saya sendiri yang akan membongkarnya.
Lihat saja kelak." Mereka mengadakan persetujuan (dan) berangkat semua.

Para Kapedhak dan Magersari segera mencabut ronggak-conggak.

Yang di muka masih sedang memasang (tonggak-tonggak) (tapi) ronggak-tonggak yang sudah diranam lagi sedang dibongkar dari belakang.

CANTO II]

1. Segera setelah dilihat oleh pemimpin-pemimpin, yaitu tukang jalan Belanda, bahwa tonggak-tonggak sedang dicabut dari belakang oleh pengikut-pengikut Dipanagara, marahlah mereka melihatnya (dan) mereka berkata: "Eh Macanan-Macanan, lihat itu!
Tonggak-tonggak sedang dibongkar lagi

2. oleh orang-orang Dipanagaran.
Akan buat apa kamu? Apakah kamu akan melawan mereka?
Atau melaporkan (itu dulu) kepada Raden Adipati (Danureja)?" Sang Macan Sembawa menjawab: "Eh, Tuan-Tuanku, tukang jalan,

apabila belum pasti kita

3. akan menderita atau kena mati tidak usah melaporkan kepada Gusti (Danureja)." Macan Sembawa bersabda keras: "Kawan-kawanku semua harap bersiap memegang kayu pemukul!

163

Indonesian Malay Translation

jangan menggunakan senjata (sebab itu) akan membuat malu kita

4. waktu melawan orang-orang Dipanagaran.

Tidak seberapa kekuatannya; tidak mungkin jadi sebab!
Orang-orang itu banyak yang kurus.

Patut dipukul,

sekali saja, mereka akan mati jatuh terkulai dan tidak bergerak lagi.
Heh, kawan-kawanku, mari bersama-sama,

maju dengan membawa pemukul!"

5. Tentera Macanan yang gagah berani semua diberi perintah oleh keruanya.
Dengan gembira mereka memegang pemukul sesuka hati: ada yang memegang kayu jati atau glugu, yang lain mencabut kayu jarak empat batang diikat jadi satu.

6. Sebagian memegang batang-batang pohon pinang lainnya meruntas cabang beringin dan bongkoran buluh betung, sepanjang lengan.
Ada seorang kopral dari (golongan) Macanan bernama Macan Laut; dia tidak memakai barang-barang,

niatnya hanya untuk merebut keris

7. dan kain kepala, yang diharapkan waktu perang sedang bergomo! hebat sekali (dan) kawan dan lawan sedang bingung, past mudah dicabut dengan paksa.
(Pikirannya sebagai berikut): "Kalau saya senantiasa memegang buluh, saya akan kehilangan nafkah untuk sehari (dan) akan dicerca oleh anak-anak dan isteriku.

8. Apa gunanya orang berkelahi kalau tidak dirangkap memperoleh kemilikan yang dapat dibawa dengan ringkas?
Nanti kalau saya telah pulang ke rumah alangkah suka hati si Rubiyah, (sebab dapat) dijual untuk berbelanja (dan akan) cukup untuk sehari dan semalam".

164

indonesian Malay Translation

Para Macanan memukul

bertubi-tubi tapi tidak dengan terarur.

Terdengar suara mendesir-desir dari pukul-pukulan yang ditangkis oleh Kapedhak

dan askar-askar Magersari dengan gagah berani.

15. Oleh sebab mereka sering dipukul yang menghindarkan (bertindak) dengan tenang (dan) pantas, berkat mereka sudah dilatih.
Magersari (dan) Kapedhak sudah diajar oleh orang Bugis untuk memegang pemukul, menghindarkan diri (dan) berpencak dengan cara Cina, jadi mereka tidak kekurangan kepantasan.

16. Para Macanan tidak pernah belajar hal-ihwal perang.
Mereka kenyang puji-pujian dan sanjungan.

17. Pentungnya para Macanan kerap jatuh terpelanting (dan) terpencar. Mereka dibalas sampai pingsan: ada yang dipukul di leher belakang, yang lain di kening, yang lain lagi dipukul di kedua belah kakinya sehingga putus, (ada) yang dipukul di tulang sehingga berbaring (di tanah) pincang (dan) timpang.

18. Waktu Macan Sembawa melihat kawan-kawannya askar banyak yang mandi darah, dia mengamuk bermati-matian (dan) menyerbu (dengan) memegang kerisnya terhunus, menggosok dadanya, mengerutkan (bibir-bibirnya dan) menggigit misainya, (serta berteriak-teriak): "Mari, orang-orang Dipanagaran, lekaslah mundur!

19. Agaknya kamu sekalian belum mendengar berita

bahwa saya seorang pilih tanding (dan) ketua penjahat gerajul dari Kedu

166

Babad Dipanagara

dari (orang-orang) penjahat di Parakan: (saya) tidak mempan serangan senjata tajam.
Kalian pasti tidak

cukup kuat melawan saya!"

20. Para Magersari dan Kapedhak berteriak bersama:; "Awas kawan-kawan!
Jangan menarik keris!
Macan tinggal seekor, meskipun berjalur-jalur kalau dipukul pasti binasa.
Tapi jangan sampai kurang teliti pukulanmu harus tepat!"

21. Macan Laut memohon belas kasihan dengan merengek: "Mau apa dari saya?" Pandangannya beralih-alih, tubuhnya gemetar,

belakangnya bergoyang-goyang (dan) kentut-kentut berbunyi dengan terus-menerus.
Dia menyumpah berkali-kali: "Saya bukan orang Macanan!"

22. Para Kapedhak dan Magersari menjawab dengan kasar: "Bohong kamu!
Pakaianmu masih sempurna: bajumu dan seluarmu bercorak (kain) bintulu merah, dan kerismu sarungnya gayaman dengan ukiran cara Bali.

23. Kalau kamu mengaku bukan Macanan, saya akan mengambil kerismu dan bajumu, kain kepalamu (berwarna) ungu dengan kainmu!"

Macan Laut mengaduh

dan mengucapkan tangawut (doa) tiga kali (dan berkata): "Silahkan ambilnya!"

24. Dalam batinnya Macan Laut bersumpah:

"Kelak anak dan cucu saya hingga tuju keturunan

167

Indonesian Malay Translation

bila sedang maju ke medan perang

jangan sampai menghinggapi kemilikan para pakaiannya lawan, hidup atau mati,

di medan perang jangan memikirkan."

25. Keris, kain, baju dan kain kepala semua diserahkan.
(Macan Laut) lalu menangis dan kakinya diinjak-injakkan tanah dengan keras, tapi dia udak dipukul.
Dengan rambut terurai, dia berteriak sepanjang jalan.

Para Magersari dan Kapedhak

gembira hati melihat dukacitanya.

CANTO IV

2. Macanan sudah kalah (dan) melarikan diri. Banyak yang menderita luka-luka: ada yang (punya) kaki patah.

3. Dia tertawa kecil (dengan) menutup bibirnya, (lantas) memanggil abdi pengiring dua orang, yang diperintahkan untuk memanggil para Kapedhak dan Magersari (supaya menghadap Pangeran) (dengan berkata): "Semua! Jangan ada yang ketinggalan!" Dua-duanya sudah berangkat.

4. Setelah datang semua, mereka duduk bersaf-saf (dan) menyembah.
Sang Pangeran bersabda perlahan:

(dan mereka) memanggil tukang jalan.

'. Mereka maju sedang topinya diimpit di bawah ketiak (dan) mereka melaporkan dari awal

sampai akhir.

Laporannya dari tukang jalan

tidak ada yang kurang.

Tuan Smissaert dan Chevallier setelah

mendengar (laporannya itu) meajadi amat marah.

. Gigi berkerot-kerot dan matanya merah melotot, kepalanya menggeleng-geleng (dan) bulu keningnya berdiri.
Andaikata Tuan Smissaert

bertubuh tinggi dan besar dia bagaikan raja raksasa dari Ngalengka

. waktu mendengar (laporan) matinya

raksasa Ari Nglebur Gangsa (Kumbakarna).
Tetapi harus ditambah perbandingan yang lain, sebab dia (Smissaert) tubuhnya pendek,

kecil dan kurang bagus;

sedang perutnya bergantung

seperti jin Sang Pulunggana

| 69

Indonesian Malay Translation

10. pada waktu mendukung Somba menjadi pencuri, (dia) masuk keraton Ngastina (dan) bersembunyi dalam kendi potol, (tapi) dapat diketahui oleh anak Arjuna dari kayangan, (namanya) Bambang Wilugangga. Dia sudah tahu bahwa Pulunggana sedang bersembunyi

11. di dalam sebuah kandang itek di kendi yang rosak.
(Sekarang) inilah contohnya untuk Tuan Chevallier. Dia bagaikan anak dari Arjuna

berwujud raksasa dari gunung namanya jin Jayawigena,

12. yang sedang mabok (buah) gayam lantas tertidur di tengah hutan.

Begitulah perbandingan

yang terlalu panjang kalau diceritakan (dengan lengkap).
Seketika sudah disuruh

tiga orang kerani berlari-lari: (yang satu)

memanggil Raden Adipati

13. Danureja; yang satu memanggil Tumenggung Wiranagara, yang satu lagi memanggil Tuan Dietree.
Dengan tergesa-gesa mereka datang menghadap (di muka) Tuan Smissaert.
Tiga-tuganya memberi salam dan semua duduk dengan teratur.

14. (Setelah) Raden Adipati (Danureja) melihat askar-askar Macanan berserak-serak (di halaman) (dan mendengar) jerit-jeritan dan sambat-sambaran, dia mengutuskan seorang Mantri peratua (namanya) Ngabeh: Wiraprana yang diperintah untuk membawa (mereka) pulang kembali ke Danurejan.

15. Tuan Smissaert bersabda dengan tenang: "Raden Adipati Danureja dengan kamu Tuan Dietrée

170

Babad Dipanagara

berserta Wiranagara,

bagaimana pendapatmu?

Pangeran Dipanagara (sudah) banyak menghina saya.

16. Dia (sama sekali) tidak memikirkan pemerintah (Hindia-Belanda) (dan) tidak menurut haluan negara, | (tapi hanya) mengikuti keinginan diri sendiri.
Sedang perasaan saya, andaikan api, jika tidak dipadamkan dengan berani boleh jadi berkobar-kobar."

17. Tuan Setiausaha bersabda: "Benar Kanjeng Tuan Residen, saya setuju.
Pangeran Dipanagara (harus) segera ditangkap (dan) diasingkan kepada suatu tempat di seberang." Wiranagara berkata

18. kepada Kanjeng Raden Adipati (Danureja): "Kyai Lurah, bagaimana pendapatmu?
Apakah seperti Chevallier?"

Sang Raden Adipati berkata:

"Kalau masih menjadi pembicaraan

seratus ribu kali, saya tidak akan menganut." Kanjeng Tuan Residen

19. Smissaert lantas berkata: "Sang Adipati bagaimana yang (harus) menjadi cadangan, sebab sekarang sudah terang bahwa Pangeran Dipanagara tidak menyayangi negara dan ratunya." Raden Adipati Danureja

20. berkata: "Jika diperkenankan

saya akan mengirim utusan dengan surat.
Para Panewu dan Mantri akan diutus

171

24.

Sasradiningrat, kalau

dia mengizinkan kirim pesuruh-pesuruh yang (dapat) diberi tugas untuk (mengawasi) jalan-jalan dan jambatan-jambatan

yang ada di bawah kekuasaan Surakarta

di sekitar

negeri Yogyakarta.

Meskipun dekat dengan (negara) sini banyak terdapat tanah-tanah

di bawah kekuasaan Surakarta.
Tidak boleh dipandang ringan.
Sudah adat kebiasaan

kalau membuat jalan

(bahwa itu) dikerjakan bersama-sama.

. Kedua negara, Yogya dan

Surakarta, tidak boleh kalau kurang selaras (dan) rukun (sebab) sebarang pekerjaan tidak akan berhasil.

Kalau perundingannya sudah bulat tidak akan ada perselisihan

antara Yogya dan Surakarta

dan kehendak Tuan akan terlaksana.

Kalau Pangeran Dipanagara

(masih) memaksa mempertahankan diri dan tidak memperbolehkan perkebunan Tegalreja

dilintasi jalan,

makin besar dosanya.

Demikianlah pendapat saya.

Seperti menentang kepada kedua negara (dan) Pangeran Dipanagara

pasti dapat dipertahankan dengan ringan.
Tapi terserah

kehendak Paduka Tuan."

Smissaert mengangguk-angguk

dan bergembira sekali.

172

Babad Dipanagara

26. Tuan Residen berkata dengan tenang: "Jurubahasa Dietrge bagaimana pendapatmu tentang nasihat ini?
Dapatkah kamu ada persesuaian dengan Sang Raden Adipati?"

Tuan Godlieb Dietree menyahut: "Saya mengikuti saja

27. pendapat Raden Adipati

Danureja. Itu jauh sekali yang paling patut (sebab) tidak luput mengindahkan

adat yang sudah dilakukan.

Dia tenang (dan) berhati-hati,

teliti dalam semua pembuatan,

jarang sekali ada kesilapan.

28. Jadi silakan Raden Adipati lekas membuat surat (dan) mempersiapkan utusan-utusannya, para Panewu (dan) Mantri untuk menyampaikan surat ke Surakarta." (Sang Raden Adipati) mengatakan persetujuan (dan) minta diri untuk pulang.

Tuan, adat orang Jawa

adalah bahwa dalam perang jarang ada yang adil: tipu muslihat, bujukan

(dan) tipu daya dipakai dulu.

(Orang Jawa) tidak seperti orang Kompeni

(dan) bergembira kalau jalannya perang seru.

Kalah (atau) menang (mereka tetap mempertahankan) ketertiban (dan) tidak memakai tipu daya.

Tapi bagi orang Jawa sudah menjadi kebiasaan

HISTORICAL NOTES AND COMMENTARY

1 Respati Wage kaping sangalaslsasi Bitsar ing taun Be: For a full discussion of the date and chronology of the babad, see part II of the Introduction above.

2 Panjendnganira KalngYyeng Sultan!......lPanjentngan gangsal warseki: Sultan Hamengkubuwana V was born on 25 Jan. 1820 and was raised as Sultan on 19 Dec. 1822 when he was not quite three years old. He ruled with the help of guardians until 26 Nov. 1836 and his nickname was Sultan 'Timur' (the 'young' Sultan) see SB 136 (Babad Ngarogya, vol. II) XIV. 5-6, p. 61; XXX1.39, p.

126; Kota Jogjakarta dua ratus tahun, p. 153; MvK 2452, BGG br, 4 Feb. 1820, nos. 15-16.

3 sinung emban Sang Narpalsakawan pikukuh: on the establishment of the guardians by De Salis see Louw, vol. 1, pp. 449-52. Contrary to the impression

given in this babad, the four guardians were Dipanagara, Mangkubumi, Ratu Ageng and Ratu Kencana (on the latter see below n. 120). The seal of state was entrusted to the Resident (Smissaert) and the administration of the Sultan's lands was in the hands of the Patih, but these latter were not guardians.

4 sisilih Kadipatyan: this would seem to suggest that Mangkubumi, the senior Yogya Pangeran, was placed in charge of the kadipaten (the Crown Prince's establishment) until such time as a new Crown Prince was appointed. But there is no confirmation of this in other Dutch and Javanese sources.

5 apan angreh sajroning pnril......! mring Pangran Dipanagara: all four guardians had control of the kraton finances and the administration of the court did not solely devolve on Dipanagara, although the latter remained a figure of importance and influence in kraton circles, see J.F. Walraven van Nes, 'Verhandeling over de waarschijnlijke oorzaken, die aanleiding tot de onlusten van 1825 en

de volgende jaren in de vorstenlanden gegeven hebben', TNI, vol. 6 (1844), pp. 145-52 (henceforth Van Nes, 'Verhandeling').

6 Nayakanira Sang Rajeng: the Sultan's Nayakas (principal advisers) were the eight Wedanas (the four Inner and four Outer Bupatis of the court), who gave particular help to the Patih in the business of administration, see GR, vol. 1, p.
238. In this babad, the term is used very loosely to describe an 'authority' not a

head of a department of the kraton administration as is usual (note of Dr.
Th.G.Th. Pigeaud).

7 marang Kangjing Raden DipatiiDanurZja ..... this refers to Raden Adipati

Danurëja IV, Patih of Yogyakarta, 2 Dec. 1813-13 Feb. 1847. For a discussion of his character and antecedents see below n. 97.

8 kukumah hat myang kisas: both hadd and gisas are parts of Islamic penal law, see Juynboll, HMW, pp. 295-311. In the Javanese kratons before 1847, this law was

administered by the court of the Syramb;, see below n. 12 and LW. C. van den Berg, 'De Mohammedaansche Geestelijkheid', p. 33.

9 gilap song-songipunlsaengga kadya Narendra: one of the changes brought about by Daendels' famous decree on 'Ceremonial and Etiquetre' (28 Jul. 1808) was

234

Babad Dipanagara

=> right of the Residents to carry a gold state umbrella (payung) with a blue smpe. emblazoned with the arms of Lodewijk I (Louis Bonaparte) of Holland

1806-1810) which, according to De Graaf, GI, p. 369, was designed by Deendels himself. The choice of gold, a colour usually only reserved for roy&n in Java, naturally seemed to the Javanese to plac Residents on the same footing as the independent rulers. Daendels decision remained in tosce. with minor variations, throughout the nineteenth century and was only «nally abolished by the bormat and peyung circulars of Governor-General J.B.
van Heutsz (1904-09) in 1904 (see E. Breton de Nijs (pseud. Rob Neuwenhuys), Tempo Doeloe. Fotographische documenten ust bet oude lesi? (Amsterdam, 1973), p. 114. On Jr. Anthonie Hendrik Smissaert (17771832) who was Res. of Yogyakarta from 11 Feb. 1823 until his dismissal on 26 Sept. 1825, see D.M. Campbell, Javea Past and Present, vol. I (London, 1915),

pp. 438-40 and De Haan, 'Personalia', pp. 648-9 (see also below ns. 87 & 1521

.-. Pangeran kakalih detanisinaruwe ...... the fact that Mangkubumi and Dipanagara

were rarely consulted on affairs relating to the guardianship was noticed both by Dutch officials and by contemporaries in the kraton (see dK no. 111, De

Kock, "Over het karakter van den Soesoehoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de prinsen en rijksgrooten', 10 Dec. 1829; dK no. 165, "Translaat-verhaal van Prins Adiwinotto', n.d.; Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 575-6). Later, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara complained to De Kock about the failure of the Resident, the Secretary (Chevallier) and the Patih, to consult with them: LOr 2168. no. 11, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, n.d. (? 29 Sept.
1825): ..... punapa malih kula sami minongka angembani dhumateng ing) Jengandika Sultan Timur, sakathahing paparentah boten mawi atepang kaliyan kula ...
Dipanagara himself was also partly to blame for the breakdown in communications for he seems to have withdrawn almost completely from affairs in Yogyakarta after about April 1824, see Van Nes, 'Verhandeling', pp. 152-3.

11 bang wong cilik bingung: the description which is given here of the general decline and corruption in Yogyakarta before the Java War, is common to many babad descriptions of periods of dissoluteness. But it is particularly important in this context as it has a direct connection with popular expectations of the coming of the Ratu Adil. In the Javanese view the period immediately preceding the rule of the 'Just King' would be one of rapid social and political decay, see Wiselius, 'Djâjá Bâjá, p. 186; Drewes, Drie Javaansche Goeroe's, pp. 1604; Louw, vol. I, Bijlage XVII, p. 730 and above pt. V.F. of the Introduction.

12 tan lumampah chukuming Surambil nora ajég adiling Pradata: the law courts in Yogyakarta during this period were divided between the Pradata (civil court),

the Surambi (Islamic court), the Resident's court, and the Jaksa ndgara (magis trate's court).

(i) The Pradata was presided over by the chief magistrate of Yogyakarta (yaksa ageng), Kyai Tumenggung Nitipraja, the jaksa (magistrate) of the Patuh, the jaksa of the Crown Prince, and the jaksas of the 8 Wedanas. It met on set days in the pendhapa Pradatan, and if cases involved Chinese or Europeans, the Resident or the Assistant-Resident was always present. Sentences passed were based on the Javanese lawbooks, Angger Pradata-Dalém, Anggtr-Aging and Angger Sepuluh, and the right of revision of sentence was reserved to the Patih in cases

involving Javanese.

(ii) The Surambi was the religious court presided over by the chief Pengulu of Yogyakarta, the Ketib Arom and four mosque Ketik: (on the title Ketib, see

235

Historical Notes & Commentary

below n. 102). The religious scholars in fiqh law (i.e. the ulama; from the pathok negara) were also usually consulted on all matters of religion, death, marriage and inheritance. Cases were tried in the main square in front of the

mosque or within the mosque (Mesjid Ageng) itself. Any death sentences were revised by the Resident's court.

(iii) The Resident's court was presided over by the Resident, AssistantResident, the Patih and the Pergala, with the chief jaksa acting as the public prosecutor. The court itself had been set up by Raffles' regulation of Rl Feb.
1814 (see Raffles, HJ, vol. II, Appendix D) for cases involving all Javanese not born in the princely territories, and for Europeans, Chinese and other foreigners. 'Government law' (a blend of Roman law and Dutch civil law) was used.
The revision of sentences was referred to the High Court (Raad van Justitie) in Semarang, where, after 1817, all cases involving tollgate disputes berween

Javanese and Chinese were tried (see MvK 2439, BGG br, 14 Sept. 1817, no.
9 and above pt. IX of the Introduction).

(iv) The Jaksa negara, was the magistrate's court, presided over by the Patih's assistant, was held ar the pasebar before the kraton or before the kepasiban. It usually reviewed cases before passing them on to the jurisdiction of the other courts (see MvK 3055, 'Beschrijving en statistieke rapport betreffende de Residentie Djocjocarta' (1836); further descriptions of the legal system at the Central Javanese courts can be found in Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', pp.
633-52; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving', p. 69, pp. 112-17; Van den Berg, 'De Mohammedaansche Geestelijkheid', p. 33 and vAE (aanwinsten, 1941) no.

23, Nicolaus Engelhard, 'Vlugtig overzicht van Java aan het einde van 1825, n.d.)

For contemporary descriptions of Danureja's interference with the working of the Pradata before the Java War, and for Danureja's dismissal of two of Dipanagara's associates, see Louw, vol. I, p. 25, pp. 85-7, pp. 522-23, Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 328.

13 runggak jarak marajak!......bintlan wadya rucah: both of these Javanese proverbs illustrate the social changes which occurred in Yogyakarta before the outbreak of the Java War, and have a connection with the period of decline which was thought to precede the rule of the Ratu Adil (see above n. 11). The ricinus (castor-oil plant) is a bush which grows anywhere in Java and is very commonplace, whereas the teak tree (yatr) takes years to come to maturity and is very valuable. Thus, by implication common people were appointed to undeserved positions, whereas the older incumbents, who had taken years to gain the maturity and wisdom which the positions demanded, were dismissed. For a description of the social changes preceding the Java War in Yogyakarta see the Introduction pt. IX above and Louw, vol. I, pp. 85-87 quoting Jayadiningrat.

14 karya pasanggrahan Téigailrija: the pasanggrahan mentioned here almost certainly refers to Dipanagara's retreat (Pantpen) at Selar&ja which he built after the death of his great-grandmother in 1803, slightly to the north-east of the main building at Tégalréja (see Louw. vol. I, Map 3). In his babad, Dipanagara described the site, which had a small building and a stone (sela gilang) for performing rapa (asceticism and meditation) sheltered by a kemaning tree (see below n. 16) and ringed around completely by a moat. The place where Dipanagara sat was therefore an island, and in another place it is referred to as the 'Pulo Waringin', the island of waringins, for it was planted with those trees.
In front of the small building there was a large curved pond full of different kinds of fishes (LOr 6547 b (Babad Dipanagara), XX AO-41, p. 324, XX.52, p. 328). Dipanagara's description is confirmed in Brumund's report on the site ('Bezoek', pp. 192-4) written in the 1840's:

236

Babad Dipanagara

'From Tégalrtja, we went to Selaréja. It lies on the east side of Tegalreja and very close by..... Selareja was the principal place of penance and prayer for Dipanagara. It is a fair space and area of uneven ground which lies within the wooded area of the desa (village). Of the wall which earlier encircled it, only parts remain. There is not much to see. The spout which conveyed his water "as long since dried up. Only dry trenches are left. At the side there still stand the walls of a small house, which consisted of just one room with a large couch built of brick. There the penitent ate and drank ... in front of the house lies a dry stone pond. Here and there fruit trees grow. The scent of the pungent &imuning tree hlls the air. It is the tree of holy places and graves .... six large sonis (female Sivaitic symbols) especially catch the eye. They are placed in two rows next to each other, the three rear ones slightly higher than the three in front. They formed the broad prayer place of Dipanagara. In front of it bends a small, deep stone pond ... the bottom of the yonis had been placed uppermost

vol. 20 (1969), pp. 135-83).

© prinab lering kadbatun: Tégalréja does not lie due north of the kraton but about three kilometres to the N.W. and was connected w Yogya at that time by a small road across the rice-helds (see Louw, vol. I, Map. 3). It was built by Dipanagara's great-grandmother (the Ratu Agéng T&gairéja) in the 1790's.

in wit dbuku: Lansium Domesticum Jack: a tree which has small white flowers,

yellow at the base. The wood is very much sought after in Java for making axes

and lances, and the fruit is eaten everywhere. The bitter seeds are used as a medicine against worms and mixed with the resin of styrax benzoin they are

burnt as incense to chase away mosquitoes (sec F.S.A. de Clercq. Nieuw

Plantkundig Woordenboek voor Nederlandsch Indië (Ist ed. Amsterdam, 1909) p.

266 no. 1983). Brumuad, 'Bezoek', p. 188, noticed a large kemuning tree which would have spread a canopy of white flowers over Dipanagara's head as he sat meditating (see also J. Vis Janssen van Raay, 'Wat de Oude boom in den dalem van den Javaanschen Hamiet beleefde', Indische Verlofganger 1926-7), p. 51). The withered trunk of this tree can be seen today (1972).

18 malbeng guwa kang samun: see Ricklefs, op. cit. pp. 233-41 for descriptions of Dipanagara's visits to caves in the Yogyakarta area, which included Guwa Langse (on the south coast), Guwa (on the borders of Gunung Kidul), and Guwa Secang (at Selarong, see below n. 24). Guwa Upas (in the Kulon Praga area on the road to Samigaluh) is also described in the Buka Kedhung Kebo, KITLV Or, 13, III 9-17. pp. 26a-30b as having been visited by Dipanagara, see further Louw, vol. II, p. 332.

19 samB3keng ards: in Java important graves and shrines are sometimes sited on hills. The most famous site is that of Imagiri where the members of the royal families of Yogyakarta and Surakarta are buried. Dipanagara also mentioned the hill of Rasamuni (nr. Plered on the western abutments of Gunung Kidul) where his meeting with the Reis Adi! took place. In the Buku Kedhung Kibo Dipanagara's abdr-dalim (retainers) are also depicted as having visited various mountain sites in Banyumas, Bagélen and Kìdhu to search for signs before the Java War (KITLV Or. 13 VI. 26-VIIL 12 pp. 68-84, and see Ricklefs, op. csi.
p. 237; Louw, vol. I, pp. 130-1 for Dipanagara's descripuons of visits to Imagiri and Rasamuni).

237

Historical Notes & Commentary

20 ing Silarong wastanya: Selarong (or Silarong) is a locality in the hilly limestone

area lying to the west and east of Kali Bédhog about two kilometres to the west of Bantul. The neighbourhood comprises sawab (ricefields) and palm groves near the river (Bédhog) and then a low limestone ridge and hills (see Louw, vol. I, pp. 435-7 and Map 8, 'Situatie-Schets van Selarong en Omstreken'). The kalurahan (village area) is today known as Kembang Putian and is mentioned by that name in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 25, p.
390). There is some doubt about the ownership of the tenah lungguh (apanage land) in the area at that time. According to Paku Alam I, it belonged half to a Surakarta Bupati, R.T. Rajaniti, and half to Dipanagara's younger brother P.
Adineégara, who received the land from R.T. Sumadiningrat (died 1812) because he had been brought up by him as a child (AvJ, p. Ixxxiii Paku

to Danurëja, Jul. 1825). But in the Babad B¥dhab (BL Add. 12330, XRV.1-29, f. 81v-84r) Dipanagara is described as having received grants of land in the Gesikan area (? near Bantul) after the fall of the kraton in June 1812. These grants of land to the south of Yogyakarta were also mentioned by Dipanagara to Major de Stuers after his capture at Magelang in 1830 (see De Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI, p. 745). So it is likely that he owned some of the land in the Sélarong area. Smissaert later described Dipanagara's improvements to his lands in building irrigation systems and planting coconut and fruit trees (see below n. 24). He also stated that Dipanagara owned two estates on the west bank of the Praga river named Sukama and Gegulu which served as centres for troop concentrations at the beginning of the Java War (vAE no. 28, Smissaert to King William I, n.d. (? Sept. 1828); dK no. 181, Smissaert to De

Kock, 13 Aug. 1825; Louw, vol. I, p. 432 and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p.
405).

21 sakidule ing Ambarkatawang: Ambarkatawang or Gunung Gamping (the limestone hill) lies ahout 3 kilometres due west of Yogyakarta and once served as the temporary kraton of P. Mangkubumi (HB1) before 1755. In 1825 it was still a royal pesanggrahan (see NBS 133, pt. VIII Pemut yasa-dalém kalangenan"). The place was important for the production of limestone which was used as bricks and mortar in buildings in Yogyakarta (see the references in Dj. Br.
22, Wiese to Daendels, 22 Oct. 1809; Van Sevenhoven, 'Aanteekeningen', p.
107; KITLV H 698 b, AvJ, Nahuys yan Burgst to Van der Capellen, 3 Feb.
1820, who stated that 600 piéwl;s of limestone was sold every month in

Yogyakarta). Before the Java War, Dipanagara, in his function as a guardian, apparently controlled the Chinese workers in the limestone ovens at Gamping

but Danureja touk them away from him (see Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 13). One of

the reasons for Smissaert's decision to widen the road around TéEgalrEéja was to facilitate the transport of lime to Yogyakarta (see below n. 42).

22 pacéngkraman kadya negari: pacengkraman (GR, vol. 1, p. 309) has the sense of a place to wander and relax especially in the company of women. The construction of royal pavilions (péanggrebhans) in such places outside Yogyakarta was

especially popular during the reign of the second Sultan and before the Java War (see Van Nes, 'Verhandeling', p. 123).

23 ... lan-alun: an alun-alun is a large square or open space before the residence of a Bupati or before a kraton (see GR, vol. I, p. 115).

24 denreka pataman: Dipanagara's improvements to his estates were described by Smissaert (see above n. 20). In his babad, Dipanagara mentioned the garden outside the cave of Sécang which was called 'Modang' (see LOr 6547 b, XX.
48, p. 326 and GR, vol. II, p. 495 which describes modang as a white or evenly coloured rectangle or square in the middle of a headshawl or jacket). The cave and the area surrounding it were apparently improved by Dipanagara's retainers (Interview with the Lurah of Kembang Putian, 12 Dec. 1971 and Louw, vol. 1,

The wood of the durian is much ->e; in Java for furniture and planks. The pips of the durian fruit are cooked ater the skin has been taken off and eaten with rice. Manggis, G. Mangostana - De Clercg, p. 245, no. 1592) is a tree (mangostan tree) which has a pleasi=: purple skinned fruit. The wood is used for building houses and the skin of me fruit serves as a purple die. A decoction of the dried skin of the fruit can < used as a potion against stomach ailments. Dbuwiér, E. Jambolana Lam.

The picture which the babad gives here was confirmed by Dipanagara in a conversation with Major de Stuers (De Klerck, vol. V. Bijlage XXXVI, p. 744, in which he said ... 'I often went ro Pasar Gédhe (Kutha Gédhe), Imagiri, to the south coast and to Selarong ... to the (latter) two places I always took a large escort with me ... to help cut and plant pedi (rice) which popularised the chiefs with the people ... :.

28 kathah para Tuminggunghnyang Kaliwon Panewu Mantri: these are titles which refer to officials of the Sultan's administration or to members of his family.
Tumenggung is a very old title already in use in the Majapahit period, and by the nineteenth century often employed to indicate a Bupati (see GR, vol. 1, p.
710). Paenews (lit. 'the leader of a thousand men') is also used to refer to a Bupati. Kliwon was the deputy of the Bupati and was used especially to denote the assistants of the 8 Wädanas in the kraton (see above n. 6 and GR. vol. I., p.
495). Mantri is a slightly lower administrative official, usually a subordinare of the Kliwon (see GR. vol. II, pp. 471-2). The titles Pengerar and Aria refer to members of the Sultan's family: the former is usually given to the sons and brothers of the Sultan, but it is not an automatic title and is given by the Sultan according to the status of the mother. Aria (Ría from Skr. 'arya') is the title of younger brother and is also used for Pangerens and their sons. According to a report written in the early 19th century, the title Aria referred to distant relations of the sovereign see IOL Mack. Pr. 82, p. 295. The title Raden Mas Aria was sometimes given to the grear-grandsons of the Sultan when they were not eligible for the title of Pangeran (see GR. vol. I, p. 61). One contemporary Dutch source (KITLV H 76, pt. 2) lists 11 Pungeraus, 17 Taménggungs, 64 lower administrative officials and 78 Demangs from the Sultan's lands as having followed Dipanagara at the beginning of the Java War. According to Jayadiningrat ('Schetsen', p. 16) a meeting took place between Dipanagara and various Yogyakarta officials (Pangerans, Tumenggungs, Mantris and Démangs from the villages) on 29 Oct. 1824 (5 Mulud A.J. 1752) ar Têgalrëja to discuss the possibility of a rebellion, although some were against the plan. P. Adiwinata mentioned another meeting between Dipanagara and various Yogyakarta Pangerans Jayakusuma (later P. Ngabehi), Adinegara, Suryabrangta, Adisurya, (the latter three were brothers of Dipanagara) in June 1825 after the question of the road had come up. The Pangerens agreed to bring the desa inhabitants out to fight and Suryabrangta undertook to kidnap the young Sultan from the kraton. Burt the plan was discovered because an attempt to include Purwadipura in the plot failed (dK 165, 'Translaat-verhaal van prins Adiwinotto van hetgeen den opstand van Diepo Negoro heeft veroorzaakt', Yogya, n.d. (?1826), (henceforth: "Translaat-verhaal Adiwinotto').

Babad Dipanagara

-. *:1;3 lunga saking nagari: the usual indication that a member of the Sultan's famiv wished to become a rebel (kraman) was his departure from the kraton, for the regular attendance of princes and high officials at the court was a means of Jemonstrating the support and recognition enjoyed by the reigning monarch.
Dipanagara himself had already indicated his displeasure by retring to his da/ém at Tegalreja and appearing rarely in the kraton in the years preceding the Java War (see above n. 10 and Ricklefs, 'Early Inspirational Experience', p. 231).
Here he is referring to his plans to leave the environs of Yogyakarta altogether and to set up a rival kraton at Selarong, see below n. 197. Thus, in his babad, he refers to the place as a nagari (a royal capital), LOr 6547 b, XXII, p. 393.
The fear that DN would leave Yogya and establish himself at Selarong was also expressed by rhe Ratu Ageng in the Bxku (KITLV Or. 13, VI. 17, p. 67b):

... pan asring andhawuhake/badhe medal Silarong kinarya pura.

The relevant passage in DN's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII (Asmaradana) p. 393) is as follows:

36. Mapan wus dadya negari Ngayogya ngalih punika kang peken kelangkung genge 36. So (Selarong) had become a capital, Yogyakarta had moved there.
Its market was very large.

Later a huge store of padi (rice) was found there, see Bas. Cour. no. 40, 5 Oct.
1825 and below n. 221.

\) denya arsa aprang sabilollah: this refers to the jihad (Mal. & Jav. prang sabil), the war in God's way' (fi sabil Allah) to bring the heathen co embrace Islam and to subject them to its laws. It is regarded as a sacred Muslim duty to conquer the unbelievers, thus the world is divided into the dar al-Islam (the territory to Islam) and the dar al-h4arb (the theatre of war) see Juynboll, HMW, pp.
341-7, and Encyclopaedia van Nederlandsch-Indié, vol. 3, pp. 502-3). The concept was well known in Java and the desire of Dipanagara 'to raise up the high state of the Islamic religion' (mangan luburipun agami [slam) was referred to often in both the Pexgerans' letters and by contemporaries at the time (see

espc. LOr 2168 no. 11, p. 5, Mangkubumu & Dipanagara to De Kock, ? 29 Sept. 1825): ... ingkang dados karsane Ki Arya Dipan&gara batén lintang namung tétépe agamane Gusti kula Kangjeng Nabi Muhammad s.a.w. .....

and see Carey, Javanese Histories', Appendix, pp. 285-8 and Louw, vol. I, p.
438). DN's commander on the north coast (pasisir), P. Serang, (see below n.
205) took the utle of Senzpatining prang Sabilollah ingkang anttepakin agama Islam (see dK 180, N.M. van Rheede van Oudshoorn (Asse. Res. Salatiga) to H.J. Domis, 29 Sept. 1825 enclosing a letter of P. Serang). In the Javanese view, the concept of driving out the unbelievers and establishing Islam as the pure religion (agama kang suci) under a ruler who would stand firm as the regulator of the religion (rate panétig panatagama) was closely linked with popular expectations of the coming of a Reis Adil (see below ns. 107-8; Drewes, Drie Javaansche Goeroe's, p. 168 and Carey 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 29-37).

31 Suktraris Sipalye kalawanisi Dhiktre jurubasane: Pierre Frederik Henri Chevallier was appointed Assistant-Resident of Yogyakarta on 28 Aug. 1823 and took up his appointment on 1 Nov. 1823. He served in that function until his death from a liver complaint on 11 Nov. 1825 (AvJ, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 28 Aug. 1823; Dj. Br. 52, Smissaert to Algemene Secretaris, 1 Nov. 1823; D;.
Br. 54, Van Sevenhoven to Van der Capellen, 12 Nov. 1825). He was born in Harderwijk in the Netherlands on 16 April 1795 and his family appears to have been of French Huguenot descent. He joined the army in a cavalry regiment, served at Waterloo and was seconded to the N.O.I.L. (Dutch East Indies

Historical Notes & Commentary

Army) in 1820. Retiring from the army in 1822 he took up a post as Secretar of the Bantén Residency from which he was transferred in 1823 to Yogya. His career was greatly advanced by the favour his father enjoyed as the tutor of Governor-General Van der Capellen's children (MvK 4132, Smissaert to Du Bus, 10 Aug. 1826; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 378; Louw, vol. I, p. 306

and p. 256 n. 3, which gives an account of his military career and see below n.
160).

Johannes Godlieb Dictrée was born in Ungaran in 1782 and went to

Yogya in 1794 where he began his career as an interpreter two years later. He continued to serve as interpreter of the Yogyakarta Residency with intermissions until Jan. 1825 and later died of wounds he received when storming Dipanagara's fortified position (benterg) at Plered in April 1826 (MvK 3124.
'Register van het Europese personeele op Java en Madoera', (Djokjokarta), 1 Jan. 1819; Dj. Br. 53, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 19 Jan. 1825; Dj. Br.
54, Van Sevenhoven to Van der Capelien 6 Jun. 1826; Bes. Cour. no. 17, 26 Apr. 1826; Louw, vol. II, p. 261 n. 1). For a description of the background to Dipanagara's personal antagonism to these two men see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 313-4; Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 41 and Van Nes, 'Verhandeling', p.
1594.

32 wong lilima ......: the babad writer is here referring to the three Dutch officials:

Smissaert, Chevallier and Dietrée as well as to Danuréja and Major Wiranagara. Dipanagara later mentioned to Knoerle ('Journal', p. 7) that Danuréja, Chevallier and Smissaert had been as one (dados tunggal kemawon) and that

these three rode out together, ate together, and that the common people (yang alit) could never get justice because the three were 'as one together'.

lar spectacle and a drum beaten to attract an audience. This is the sense implied here (note by Dr. Th.G.Th. Pigeaud, Leiden, Jul. 1973).

..... sun arsa ngupaya margiltinundbung mring Walonda: it is not clear that Dipanagara incited the Dutch to attack him ar T&galréja and it seems more likely that their expedition took him by surprise. It is certain, however, that he was planning a rebellion in advance. P.H. van Lawick van Pabst (MvK 4132, 'Consideratiën op de Nota van den Heer MacGillavry', Aug. 1826 (henceforth Van Pabst, 'Nota') mentioned that he was preparing to revolt at least three months before the attack on TégalrEéja. Most reports state that he was planning to start his campaign in the month of Sura in the Javanese year Waws (16 Aug.
- 15 Sept. 1825). Thus, a Haji reported to Danuréja that Dipanagara had

plans to leave Yogyakarta and go co Majasta near TEmbayat on 8 Surg (Av), Haji Ali to Danuréja, 18 Jul. 1825). The Buky mentions that all his followers

were awaiting 7 Sura to start the rebellion (KITLV Or. 13 IX. 12-13, p. 89) and a report by a cavalry captain of the Mangkunégaran Legion stated that Dipanagara's followers at Sëlarong were awaiting the month of S#ra to begin their attack on Yogyakarta (dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825). Smissaert himself wrote that the first full-scale attack of Dipanagara's troops on Yogyakarta took place on 8 Sura (22 Aug.
1825) when the prince's followers advanced on the town dressed in white wirh turbans of various colours (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Resident of Kédhu (P.

le Clercg), 23 Aug. 1825 and see Payen, 'Voyage', 18 Aug. 1825 who related the rumour that Dipanagara had had a dream in which Sultan Agung had told him that 8 Sure was the right time to attack Yogya). For a discussion of the

significance of the month of Sxra as a time for the Ratu Adil to proclaim himself, see below n. 108.

Babad Dipanagara

+. - 42: where he is described as the Patih of P. Mangkubumi who carried a e-er to Dipanagara from Smissaert on 19 July 1825 (see below n. 140). He is aso referred to in the Jayabaya version of the Babad Dipanagara, (NBS 37, II.
*. p 9) He later became an army commander of Dipanagara in Bagelen with de name of Tumenggung Reksapraja (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 43, pp. 394-5, and

see below n. 216). In Jayadiningrat 'Schetsen', p. 56 he is referred to as Kyai \;gathëamnúl

»m=<ierimuka wong durjana jro nagari: this refers to the very large class of banzits. robbers and idlers who made their living by thieving and highway robbery.
Thev are referred to later in the babad (Il. 10) as wong xrakan (the scum of

the earth). A good example of a wong durjana is the bandit chief from Parakan .~ KEdhu who is described below (see n. 74). Often the wong darjana werc erstwhile members of the gledbag, the porters' guilds ar the kratons or bwjangs andless labourers) (see Louw, I, p. 26). The latter originated from the villages mur during their cime as porters on the roads (usually six months) picked up namits of gambling and opium smoking which usually led to crime (see J.1. van *venhoven's excellent description in KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen er houden op eene reis over Java van Batavia naar de Oosthoek in ...... 1812", pop 49-32 (henceforth Van Sevenhoven, 'Aanteekcningen'). Crawfurd calculated that there were about 30,000 such men in the Kédhu area in 1812 carrying loads as far aheld as Semarang and the courts and wrote that '... chey have no fixed habitation, and by the wandering and unsettled life they pursue, they have contracted the most inveterate habits of idleness, dissipation and profligacy ... (IOL Mack. Pr. vol. 21, John Crawfurd, 'Report upon the Dis'rut of Cadoe, 15 Nov. 1812, p. 284 and see Afdeling Statistiek, De Residen::: Kadoe (Batavia, 1871), p. 53, p. 58 on the strength of KEdhu porters when compared to those from other areas). The most important centre of wong durana in the Yogyakarta area was Blunyah, slightly to the north of the town, which later became the headquarters, of the Yogyakarta underworld described

so fascinatingly by J. Groneman in his Een kètjoe geschiedenis: Vorstenlandsche toetanden I1, Djogja 20 Feb. 1884 (Dordrecht 1887). It was common practice for Javanese nobles to have such men in their pay: thus in Yogya before the Java War, P. Ngabehi, P. Pamot, P. Demang and P. Abubakar had particularly bad repurations as paymasters of professional robbers (dK 145, Waterloo, 'Memorie' (1808); Dj Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 7 Aug. 1825). According to Van der Kemp ('Economische Oorzaken' p. 14 n. 1) most of the robbers (Rkeecus) in the princely territories originated from the Yogya area. Contemporary reports and other babad accounts confirm this babad's descripuon of Dipanagara's connections with wong durjana in Yogyakarta. Thus, on 15 July, he was reported to have summoned the wong durjana from Kamijara and Mangir, desas to the south of Yogya on the Kali Praga near the junction with the Kali Bedhog (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert no. 10, Mas Ngabehi Wiraprana to Danureja, 15 Jul. 1825) and there is a piagim (letter of appointment) from Dipanagara to Kyai Ngabehi Angawicana appointing him as head of all the bandits and keas (robbers) in the Yogya area (dK no. 182, MacGillavry to De Kock, 28 Jul. 1825, enclosing a translation of Dipanagara's pisgtm dated the

month of Besar, Be, A.J. 1752 (Jul. 1825). In the Yogya babad (SB 136 (Babad

Ngayogya, vol. I1), L. 41-2, p. 217) there is also a passage which relates how Demang Jayamenggala from the desa of Samen in the Pandhak district to the

south of Yogya was raised as a Tumenggung by Dipanagara with the name of

Jayanëgara and was given charge of all the wong durjana to the south of the capital (see further Bar. Cowr. no. 106, 3 Nov. 1827. report of Col. F.D.

Cochius, 20 Oct. 1827). The same man was also an expert in the manufacture of gunpowder (see below n. 166). Smissaert himself remarked on the numbers

Historical Notes & Commentary

of criminals, murderers and opium dealers who joined Dipanagara's forces : Kédhu in the first months of the war (vAE no. 28, Smissaert to Elout, 14 Sep: 1828) and Dipanagara's use of bands of tramps and wong durjana was mentione by A.D. Cornets de Groot in Surakarta (KB, Cornets de Groot private coll. IXe pt. 6. p. 15-16, A.D. Corners de Groot Jr. to A.D. Cornets de Groot Sr., Aug. 1825). Dipanagara's use of the wong durjana as troops was severely criucized in the Bxkz: KITLV Or. 13 XIV (Dhangdhanggula) p. 150:

tiyang mbegal puniku rasa mlebeng mring peken Gusti amung ngrebat tEdha

......

these robbers

feel they are entering a market, Lord, just to snatch food.

......

......

Even today Dipanagara is still compared unfavourably with P. Mangkubumi (HB 1) in some Yogyakarta circles because the latrer did not rely for support on the wong durjana during his war against the Dutch (Interviews with B.P.H.
Adinegara, Yogya, Dec. 1971 and W.S. Rendra, Yogya, Feb. 1973). See also

further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 390, p. 405; Louw, vol. III, p. 90 and Bar. Cour. no. 12, 21 Mar. 1827.

37 myang karitegipunliya padha denrusaka: this would seem to refer to the bridges on the two main roads leading out of Yogyakarta: one going N.W. to Magelang, passing into Kédhu over the Kali Krasak near Muntilan, and the other going eastwards to Surakarta over the Kali Opak at Prambanan. Dipanagara's intentions were probably to break these communications in order to starve Yogyakarta into surrender and to prevent Dutch reinforcements from getting through. This was a ractical move which had earlier been envisaged by Raden Rangga during his rebellion in 1810 (see Poensen, 'Amangku Buwi@na IT', pp. 203-4) and by P. Dipasana during his revolt in Kédhu in Feb. 1822 when the bridge over the Kali Elo was broken (MvK 2464, BGG br, 7-16 Feb. 1822, nos. 7-10). In 1825, both Dutch and Javanese troops were ambushed on the two main roads by Dipanagara's forces and most of the bridges were destroyed (see Louw, vol. I, pp. 266-71; dK no. 181, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 24 Jul. 1825; dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825; De Klerck, vols. IV & V, Maps and Payen, 'Voyage',

24 Jul. 1825 who noted that the approach roads to Yogya were dug up and obstructed with sharpened bamboo stakes).

38 atur sembah ...... a sembah is a gesture of homage, a respectful greeting or mark of respect from a lower placed person to a higher, made by bringing the two hands with palms joined to the forehead and the tops of the thumbs touching the tip of the nose (see GR, vol. I, p. 870).

39 kang samya sakit manaheldhadhongkolan Panewulmyang dhongkolan Mantri lan Tamping: dbongkol has the particular sense of premature and unjust dismissal from one's office (see GR, vol. II, p. 376). In Yogyakarta many Bapatis and lower officials had lost their positions by 1825 or had suffered a severe contraction in their landholdings. Already in 1803, the Yogyakarta Resident, J.G.
van den Berg, noticed that more Bupatis had been appointed to the

< ®

t avakarta mancanagara provinces than there were kabupaten for them to acminister (Dj. Br. 20, Van den Berg, 'Memorie', (1803). Other Bupatis lost ~a«:r positions because of the annexauons of Yogyakarta land made by Daene: Jan. 1811) and Raffles (Jun. 1812), the Babad Bédbah (BL Add. 12330, XXVI 6-8, f. 85v-86r) mentions 10 Bupatis from the mancanagara and from Kejhu who lost their positions and were forced to return to Yogyakarta. One ".: these was R.T. Sumadipura, Bupati of Japan, who was later appointed as R.
A sip Danuréja IV in December 1813. These sweeping annexations meant that thc lands which remained had w be split up amongst the Bupatis. Thus Van Lawick van Pabst (Nota') noted that whereas in 1812 in Madiun there was only ae Bupati, by 1825 there were 7 for the same post (see further Louw, vol. 1, p 520). Dipanagara himself later commented on the seriousness of the situanon by asking what would be the fate of Yogyakarta if from every local head a piece of land was taken away (Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 21). In the period immediately preceding the Java War many more officials lost their positions due to the machinations of Danuréja and his supporters (see above n. 12). Massive support for Dipanagara from these prematurely dismissed officials was an impor"ant factor in precipitating the outbreak of the Java War (see above n. 28).
Temping was the title of a village official in the Yogyakarta area, who had the cask of overseeing the bridges and roads as well as being entrusted with general

police duties outside the capital (Gericke, Jaraansch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek, p 290).

& Rahaden Dipati: the title of the Patih, Raden Adipati Danureja IV (see above n 7).

41 .. Wiranagara: was the son of Mas. T. Wiraguna, the Patih of the kadipaten during Dipanagara's youth. He had studied Islamic law and mysticism at the tamous pathok ndgara of Melangi just outside Yogya (see Carey, "Further Note", p. 342 n. 12) and was described by Chevallier (see Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage III, p.
599) as a 'lettered Javanese, acquainted with the history of his land and well

versed in the Qur'dw'. Many of Wiranagara's family were santris and some fought for DN during the war, see Bar. Cour. no. 109 15 Nov. 1827. Wiranagara himself was a favourite panakawan of HB IV and was appointed as the u?dana gèdhe prajurit (commander of the Sultan's bodyguard) in c. 1818-1819 with the rank of Major (SB 136 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. II) X. 51, p. 38; Av), p. Ixxxxiii and Louw, vol. I, p. 285 n. 1). He was apparently of Balinese descent like Danuréja from Untung Surapati (see below n. 178) and was at one time married to Dipanagara's eldest sister (Knoerle, Journal", p. 26; Bat Cour.
no. 100, 23 Oct. 1827 and Dwidjosoegondo, Seret Dharah, p. 103). But he incurred the prince's enmity by conducting an affair with Dipanagara's stepmother, the Ratu Aging (De Salis, 'Pro Memorie'), and he was able to influence her to side with Danuréja against Mangkubumi and Dipanagara (see further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 358 and AN BGG, 20 Sept. 1832 no.

1). According to Payen 'Voyage', 10 Jul. 1825), he was mistrusted by many Europeans in Yogya.

42 arsa karya lulurung: most Javanese accounts state that the immediate reason for the outbreak of the Java War was the decision to build a road through Dipanagara's property at Tégalréja (LOr 6547 (Babad Dipanagara) b, XX. 69, pp. 334-5; NBS 37 (Babad Dipanugara, Jayabaya version) I. 11-19, pp. 7-8; dK no. 165, 'Translaat-verhaal Adiwinotto'; Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 4). The background appears to have been as follows: on 24 May Smissaert ordered Danuréja to make improvements to various roads inside and outside Yogyakarta (Av], p. cvi, Smissaert to Danurcja, 24 May and see below n. 90 and n. 130). This involved the planting of trees and a general widening of the roads so that they could be made passable for carriages. The side roads out245

side Yogyakarta which were to be improved were those to Plered and Kutha and to Gamping (Ambarkatawang) (see MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mx 1827. Litt. 31 no. 34. Anon. to HB II, n.d.). The latter was important for the transport of lime to Yogyakarta (see n.21) The Yogya babad (SB 136, XLVI 3, p. 189) also mentions a road from Pasar Kuncen, west of Yogya, which pas ed through Tompeyan, a village on Dipanagara's estate at Tégalréja, skirurg the eastern fence of the estate and then proceeding to Bulukatm where :: joined the main road to Gamping (see further SB 136, XXXVIII. 50-52. p 161, Louw, vol. I, Map 3; Ibid., vol. III, Map 1). It is possible that the enlargement of this particular side road precipitated the conflict (see the report of Chevallier cited in Louw, vol. I, p. 139). Much annoyance was also caused by the fact that grave-sites by tbe side of the roads to Kutha GÉdhe an: Imagin were not treated respectfully by Europeans (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar

1827, Litt. 31 no. 35, Ratu Ageng & R. Ayu Hascuran to HB I1, n.d. and see further Kielstra, 'Een en Ander omtrent Dipo Negoro', p. 411).

Pangeran Dipanagaralaneng SHarong marings: in his babad Dipanagara mentiones

that he always went to the cave of Secang at Selarong during the fasting month (Puasa/Ramelan) (LO: 6547 b, XX. 8 p. 311) and he was there at the end ot the fasting month in May 1825 for he described the vision he received of the & wali wudbars on the night of 27 Ramelan (16 May 1825) (see Louw, vol. I, pp.
133- 38). His absence ar Selarong at that time is also mentioned in contemporary accounts (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar. 1827 Litt. 31, no. 34, Anon. to HB II, n.d. and Payen 'Voyage', 18 Jul. 1825). He returned to Yogyakarta for the Puasa of that year which was held on 21 May 1825 (see below n. 152) and he was at Tegalréja when the road through his property was begun to be improved on 17 June (25 Sawal. A.J. 1752, the date is given in NBS 37, I. 14.
p. 7). In his babad he described how he saw Danurtja's workmen planting

markers (LOr 6547 b, XX. 70-80, pp. 335-9), and ordered his Patih to take up the stakes (see further below ns. 45-46; 64).

mung panokawan tatilu: a panakawan has the special sense of an intimate retainer of prominent people in Java. They are mostly young men who serve without payment, but receive board and lodging. Their duties entail carrying ornaments of state, keeping guard and running errands etc. (GR, vol. II, p.
192). In Javanese society the relationship of a panakawan to his master is a rather unique one and is mirrored in the wayang (shadow puppet play) in the relationship between Semar, Gareng and Petruk, and the five Pandhawa brothers. At this time the Sultan of Yogyakarta had his own corps of panakawans, called the Jaga-upa, made up of the sons of prominent officials (see KITLV H 139 'Namen en Eer Tituls der kinderen van den Sultan, Prinsen

en Regenten te Jogjakarta' and see also BL Add. MS. 12341, f. 121r where four

Jaga-upa bedhaya (? male dancers) are mentioned). Dipanagara himself appears

to have had various peanakawans: Puthut Lawa and Puthut Gurit were mentioned by him during his time at TegalrEja (see LOr 6547 b, XX. 50, p. 327) and Sahiman, Rata and Bantheng-wareng were referred to later (see Knoerle.
"Journal", p. 22; LOr 6547 (Babad Dipanagara) b, XXI. 132, p. 370). The last two accompanied him throughout the Java War (LOr 6547 d, XXX-VIII. 150, p. 228). Sahiman was a youth of thirteen. All three shared his exile.

...... Lurah Kapidhak: on the Kapedhak see GR, vol. II, p. 227. They appear to have been a group of royal retainers who also fulfilled bodyguard duties at the courts, thus during the Kartasura period the Kapedhak referred to a company of troops (note of Dr. M.C. Ricklefs and see De Graaf, "Sultan Agung, p. 139). It is in this military sense as bodyguards that they should be understood here, and the nearest translation of Lxrah Kapidhak would probably be "Captain of the bodyguard". In a later conversation (Knoerle, 'Journal', pp. 21-2), Dipanagara

Babad Dipanagara

zennoned that before the war he had a following of 200 picked men and more us 60 others just to look after his horses, so these may be the Kapidhak referred to here.

in his babad, Dipanagara related that he was sitting by the ricefields just outase Selaréja when he saw a crowd of people and was informed by his Patih, Mas Mangunarja, that Raden Brangtakusuma, an official of the Danuréjan, had ~een ordered by Danuréja to stake out the road. Dipanagara instructed Mangunarja to take up the stakes, but warned him not to use force unless he was resisted. The account of the incident related in this babad accords well with version and with other contemporary reports (LOr 6547 b, XX.
"0-80 pp. 335-338; XXL 1-15 pp. 339-343; MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar.

a kan:bi upas kantor Gustilkatindhiyan kalik Wlandi tukang jalan: the upas kantor ais almost certainly Danuréja's offcial, Raden Brangtakusuma, who was ordered to supervize the placing of the markers. The two Dutch road overseers are not mentioned in other babad accounts, burt it is known that the Sultan had such people in his service. Thus, in 1814, two road overseers are referred to who were also entrusted with the inspection of Durch forts in the area. They were paid 480 Sp.D. p.a. by Sultan (Dj. Br. 29, R.C. Garoham, Statement of annual expenditure in the Cracton of the late Sultan Hamangkubuana the third', 1 Dec. 1814). Raffles also instituted the position of 'Superintendent of

the roads and bridges in the Native Princes Dominions', see De Haan, 'Personalia', p. 530.

In the area around Têgalrëja the villages of Tompeyan, Bulukatri and Jagalan bordered on Dipanagara's estate and had ricefields attached to them (see Louw, vol.
1, Map 3). Dipanagara himself described how villagers from Tompeyan seized the krises of Brangtakusuma's men and drove them off. Later. Demungs and Mantris brought the inhabitants from the surrounding villages to defend Dipanagara at Tegalreja (LOr 6547 b. XX. 77-9. pp. 337-8. XX). 3 4. pp. 339 40) This account is confirmed in another source which adds the detail that after the skirmish at Tegalreja. Brangtakusuma's men refused to have anything more to do with the

roads outside Yogyakarta and only consented to effect construction within the town

itself (MvK 4194, GKA, 13 Mar. 1827 Litt. 31, no. 34, Anon, to HB II, an.d. and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 390-1).

48 ..... kenap ...... from the Dutch énaap (boy), meaning a gudridon, or a small table to place a lamp, drinks or paper on (GR, vol. I, p. 392). It is interesting to note the number of Dutch words which are used in this babad. Thus, later (VI.
25), the Dutch words for gin yererer) and for glasses (g/as) are adopted in Javanese form. The north coast Bupatis are also referred to as 'Regents' (Rigen) (XIL 19 and see n. 243). This could indicate a degree of Dutch influence on kraton cicles even at this early period of the 19th century.

247

Historical Notes & Commentary

the term 'Wlanda' (Dutch) which is used by the Government's opponents in a

denigrating sense; see also below n. 119 and XII, 14 where the distinction is clearly made.

50 wiku-wikuning atigan ling jérone isi kuning: in Javanese literature Arab preachers are sometimes referred to as wiks ('egg-saints'), white outside but red inside.
Wiku indhog is a very old simile found in the Old Javanese Ramayana. The hypocrite is also sometimes compared to the treacherous heron in Indian mythology who beguiled the fishes into trusting in him. In the Javanese wayang theatre an example of such an 'egg-saint' is Drana (Kumbayana), the teacher of the Pandhawa, who treacherously sends Bima on a dangerous errand (see G.W.J. Drewes, 'The Struggle between Javanism and Islam as illustrated by the Sérat Dérmagandul', BKI, vol. 122, (1966), p. 342, n. 19). This remark should be understood in the context of the disparaging atticude of the Surakarta kraton scribe towards the religious communities in general and towards Dipanagara's connections with them in particular (see further above the Introduction pt. IV).

51 ..... wong santr:: the term santri is used in other contemporary Javanese sources, for example in the Bxka (see below n. 54) and can best be translated by "religious communities". It did not have the connotations of Islamic orthodoxy which were later applied to it in the 20th century (see C. Geertz, The Religion of Java, (New York, 1969), pp. 121-131). At this time three main groups of santris can be identified: (a) kraton sentris, members of the Islamic hierarchy in the kraton towns, mosque officials (Pingulze, Kerib, Market and Modin) and Islamic legal scholars {«lama, pathok niégara) who performed their functions at the Swrambi. (b) pradikan santris, religious teachers and jurukuncis who lived in the pradikan villages (see below n. 101). (c) Independent religious teachers (Kyais, gurus) who thrived as local teachers of spiritual disciplines and mysticism in country areas. Their instruction was very heterogeneous and could vary from bestowing magical charms (jimast) to orthodox instruction in Qur'an exegesis. Often there was bitter rivalry between the latter group and the kraton santris or those with official positions.

52 ilang churmating satriyainganggo churmating wong santri: the babad writer is here drawing the distinction between Dipanagara as a member of the kraton and his close connections with the religious communities outside. The term sa;ria indicates the son or close associate of the Sultan, a nobleman or a knight (from Skr. ésatiriya, one from the caste of the military men, sec GR, vol. 1, p.
797). The babad writer is here criticizing Dipanagara for renouncing kraton satria values, which, as a prominent member of the Yogyakarta court, he would have been expected to uphold (see the Introduction above pt. IV). It is an enlightening observation, for later, jealousy between Dipanagara's kraton and santri supporters, and in particular the rift between Dipanagara and Kyai Maja, did much to precipitate Dipanagara's defeat during the Java War (see further Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 19-21; Jar. Cour. no. 144, 2 Dec. 1828 and LOr 6553 (Sérat Lélampahanipun Mas Somarija ing Wanartja), p. 33 where the distinction between satria and sentri is also made).

53 akanthi wong arakan: see above n. 36.

54 kaum santri iku bobote sapira: this disparaging remark fits again with the babad writer's general attitude towards the santris (see above ns. 50 and 52, and the Introduction pt. IV). It is interesting that in the Bwée, a chronicle written under the direction of an erstwhile Surakarta official (R. Adip. Cakranagara), very nearly the same remarks were put into the mouth of the Surakarta Patih,

Sasradiningrat, in a conversation with Sunan Pakubuwana VI in Aug. 1825 KITLV Or. 13 (Buku Kedhung Kibo) XIV (Dhandhanggula), p. 150:

. Macanan ...: (lit. 'Tigers'), this was the name of the corps of police officials in Yogyakarta who wore striped jackets and trousers. The Macanan Anirbraja was also the name of a regiment of soldiers in the Surakarta kraton whose fhicers bore the title of Singa and the rank and file that of Macan. The Singarrzara also functioned as sharpshooters for the rulers (see GK, vol. I, p. 890; vol. II, p. 478; SW no. 66, Pakubuwana VI to Kusumayuda, n.d. and IOL Mack. Pr. vol. 2, "Miscellaneous Memorandum and Notes on the court of Solo", p. 209 which refers to a group of 100 'Macanan' infantry soldiers of the Sunan who were armed with rifles.). It is possible that the former corps of police officials is meant here. The establishment of 'a regular and permanent system of police' in Yogyakarta had been laid down by art. 7 of Raffles® treaty wich HB II] on 1 Aug. 1812, although, even before that date according to Van Sevenhoven 'see below n. 60), there was a reasonably efficient police force in the town.
According to J.D. Kruseman (NvB Port. 5, pt. 11, Kruseman to Commissioners-General, 17 Jan. 1817) the turn-out of these police officials deteriorated rapidly during the British period (1811-16) and by May 1815, they were no longer distinguishable from the rest of the population because their

uniforms had worn out. But some changes occurred after this under Danureja IV with the appointment of more G¥»ungs (village police officials who also

served as messengers for the kepatiban, LOr 6547 b (Babad Dipanagara) XVIII.
144 -XIX. 1, pp. 274-5) and by 1822, Nahuys commented that the police force was on a reasonably good footing again, NvB Port. 7, p. 6, Nahuys to De Salis, Apr. 1822. On later developments see Rouffaer 'Vorstenlanden', pp. 644-45.

 <

$5a kang abdi Lurah Macanan/Macan Simbawa raneki: the name Macan Sembawa

is perhaps based on the demoniacal spirit Kyai Murti Sembawa, see LOr 12507 and LOr 12540 (both vols. in the Ir. Moens coll. pt. 2, which are described in Pigeaud, Literature of Java, vol. IV, p. 55; p. 65.).

56 ... Békel jajarira: Btkél is a subordinate official, perhaps here an officer of the

Macanan corps and the jajars refer to the rank and file (see GR, vol. II, p. 414, p. 693).

5° pinoleng bintulu abrit: refers to the variegated check pattern of the poleng loincloth worn by the corps. The poleng incorporates 4 colours, red, white, black and yellow, which symbolize the four super-deities Brama, Guru (Siwa), Wisnu and Surya. In the wayang only Sang Hyang Bayu (the god of the Winds), Bima, Hanoman and Dewa Ruci are allowed to wear this magical cloth (Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese, p. 33 and p. 74; GR, vol.

Drama in Bali, (Kuala Lumpur, 1973), p. 53 n. 1, for a discussion of the origin of this design).

58 ukiran cara Balilgayaman warangkanipun: various parts of the Javanese kris are fashioned according to different shapes and patterns. The most important are the number of curves on the blade (é/z4k), the mereorite inlay on the blade (pamor), the shape of the base of the blade (exriga), the handle (ukiran), the sheath (gandar), and the top of the sheath or guard (warangka) (see GR, II, p.
616; R. Tanojo, Serat Kacurigan, (Solo, 1938), passim). On the gayaman shape which is carved after the form of the edible fruit of the gayam tree, see Moebirman, Keris and other weapons of Indonesia Jakarta, 1970), p. 31 and below n. 89). The fact that the Balinese style is mentioned here in conjunction with the forms of the érises worn by the Macanan is interesting, for since the time of Surapati (1686-1703) many Balinese had served as soldiers at the various kratons in Central Java and had an important influence in Javanese military circles. In 1813, for example, Crawfurd noticed that large numbers of Balinese

had entered the Sultan's and Prang WEdana's (MN I1) service as members of their bodyguard regiments (Dj.Or. 28, Crawfurd to Assey, 21 Mar. 1813) and Balinese soldiers were recruited by the Dutch during the Java War, see Louw, vol. II, p. 247 ff. Both Wiranagara and Danurëja, who were of Balinese descent from Untung Surapati (see below n. 178), may have influenced the design of the Mearanar corps. Later, during the Java War, Dipanagara apparently received many soldiers from Klungkung and Buleleng in Bali through the

connections of R.A. Mangkubumi who was herself of Balinese descent (see Knoerle, 'Journal', p. 37).

59 bebed ...: a Javanese man's dress consisting of a piece of cloth 442-S feet in

length covering the lower part of the body and wound around the waist (GR, vol. II, pp. 758-9).

59a aging inggil ing solah kadya rastksa: the image evoked here by the babad writer is that of the giants or Kurawa warriors in the Javanese wayang theatre.
Wayang wong and wayang topeng performances, as well as other forms of wayang, were becoming increasingly popular at the Central Javanese courts during the early part of the 19th century, and in Surakarta they thrived under the discerning patronage of Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820) (see Hageman, Geschiedenis van den Oorlog op Jara van 1825 tot 1830, p. 24; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving ', p. 41 and Carey 'Cultural Ecology', p. 10). This prevailing interest in theatre forms in Surakarta, especially the u eyang ropeng, is clearly marked throughout the babad (see pt. IV of the Introduction above).

60 wong gimir keplek myang kubuk: gimir is a game of dice played with a piece of money or dice which is spun with the flick of the fingers and whereby the chance depends on which side it falls, heads or tails or the number on the side of the dice (GR, vol. II, p. 617). Kiplek is a game which uses three small coins.
One side of the coins are chalked white or marked in another fashion and then thrown in the air whilst bets are laid on which side they will fall. It is a game much favoured by common Javanese (GR, vol. 1, p. 516), and Raffles, HJ, vol.

I, p. 351, also described its popularity with the berurs (porters). Krduk is a similar game which uses dice or pipe. These are usually covered with a cloth

(pakubukan) and bets placed on even or uneven numbers (GR. vol. I, p. 550).
Gambling of this nature, of which the games listed here are just a few (for other contemporary games of chance see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 5), was prohibited in public in Surakarta and Yogyakarta. It was only legal during the nineteenth century in specially designated places usually presided by a Chinese bandar who paid dues to the government authorities and often supplied opium to his customers. The British administration attempted to abolish these gambl250

ng houses (see Av), Crawfurd to Raffles, 5 Aug. 1813), but they were reinsuuted under the Dutch (see NvB Port. 5, pt. 11, Nahuys to CommissionersGeneral, 6 Feb. 1817). The ordinary Javanese were addicted to gambling and otten played surreptitiously in public or in their own houses. This was particularly the case with the betwrs (porters) of the gladhag (see above n. 36). In 1812, Van Sevenhoven noted (KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 51) that their passion for gambling was so great that at the resting places along the road they immediately commenced playing. Likewise, in his report on the region of Kedhu written in the same year, Crawfurd remarked of the barwrs in a similar fashion: 'no sooner is their hire paid to them, than they may be seen sitting in groups to gamble it away and they are altogether so impoverished that they go nearly naked ...' (IOL Mack. Pr. 21, p. 284). Van Sevenhoven, however, noticed in 1812 that the police force in Yogyakarta was much more efficient than that of Surakarta and consequently 'there were not so many bands of ragged people playing on the roads and idling ... (KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen', pp. 115-6). It is probable that the Marcanan or their predecessors were adroit at breaking up such gambling parties.

~1 .. titir muni: the titir is an alarm signal beaten out in a certain rhythm on rice blocks (blocks for hand hulling rice) with at least two or three stampers to warn the village or kampuang (urban community) of robbery, murder or other criminal actions (GR, vol. I, p. 650 and see Louw, vol. II, p. 484 for its use in the villages during the Java War).

vol. I, p. 409).

sla ... gogore pisan: there seems to be a play on words here. Gogor in Javanese r_efcrs to a young tiger (macan), hence a young member of the Maranan corps *). See also below IV. 6 line 4 where there is a similar play on the word macan.

b* omas sadhucin dinar: dhacin refers to a weight of 100 karis (1 kari =

0.617 kgs.) (see GR. vol. II, p. 349). A dinar is a piece of gold worth about one Dutch ducat (GR. vol. I, p. 566), of these there were various types in circulation: dinar icf, worth f. 1.20-2.40; dinar talen, worth f. 5.50 (half a sovereign); dinar ukon, worth f. 11-12 (one English sovercign); dinar rupiyah worth f. 21-25, and a dinar ringgis worth f. 43-50 (see Th. Pigeaud, JaraansNederlands Handwoordenboek, (Groningen, 1938), p. 68). For a list of

comparative values at the end of the eighteenth century see Hageman, 'geschied-en Aardrijskundig Overzigr', pp. 335-7.

64 tan owahb tancébe lawas: the account given here in the babad of a series of attempts to plant the markers is not fully confirmed in other sources. A contemporary letter described how the workers refused to work again on the road to Tegalrgja after the first skirmish (see above n. 47), and Dipanagara in his babad related that the Patih merely ordered his men to block off the road to Tegalr&ja at Jagalan. During the day Dipanagara's followers were able to clear the road but at night it was blocked by the Patih's men. This happened three

days in a row. Only after Dipanagara's attempts to unblock the road had failed, did armed men to start to gather at Tegalreja to defend the prince (LOr 6547 b, XX. 78-80, pp. 338-9; XXI. 1-15, pp. 339-43; Louw, vol. 1, p. 139 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 391-2). According to Van Nes, 'Verhandeling'. p. 158. bare pikes were placed by DNs followers at Tégalréja instead of stakes as a sign of warlike intent.

Lurah can refer to anyone who is in a position of authority (GR, vol. II, p. 98), hence the title Kyai Lxrah which is used later in the babad (IV. 8) by Wiranagara to Danureja. In kraton circles this is regarded as the correct address for the Pauh.

67 ..... pucang: Areca Catechu L. (fam. of Palmae) (De Clercq, op. cit. pp. 171-2)

the areca or Pinang palmtree, whose dried, peeled seeds are used everywhere in Java for betelnut.

68 ..... waringin: F. Benjamina L. (De Clercq, op. cit. pp. 237-8) the wood is

especially used for charcoal, but the tree itself is regarded with reverence in Java as the abode of spirits.

69 sabasta pain)jangira: hasta is the length from a man's elbow to the tip of the

middle finger, a fourth of a fathom (from Skr. hasta = hand) (GR. vol. I, p.
94).

70 ana Kopral Macanan ran Macan Lauti....lkubut sadina sawings: the short vignette included here concerning Macan Laut is an interesting example of how sometimes babad sources provide useful insights into social conditions of the time. In the Buéz a similar story is related about a Modin (mosque official) who received one ringgit (1 Sp. D.) as his fee for praying at the funeral of Sultan Haméngkubuwana III. He took the money home to his wife who rejoiced because their child had not eaten for three days (see KITLV Or. 13, II. 13-15, (pp. 12-13). Wages seem to have been low at the time and clearly insufficient for daily maintenance; the Babed Bidbeh (BL Add. 12330, I. 6, f. 4v) describes how the Sultan's gunners received only 8 reals (1 real silver = real batu = £2.40, see IOL Bur. F. 148/4, Raffles, 'Memorandum on Currency and Coin (1811) , pp. 173-4) in wages each year and were always short of food. The baturs (porters) were paid 10-20 cents per day (Van Sevenhoven 'Aanteekeningen', pp. 49-50) and the usual payment for labourers was 245 cents per day with food being added (see below n. 133 and Louw, III, p. 577 on payment of coolies during the Java War). In his 'Report upon the District of Pachitan', (?1812- 13) IQL Mack. Pr. vol. 21, pp. 169-70, Crawfurd reckoned that the inhabitants of Pacitan subsisted on Sp. D. 10 per year for each family (or 1.50 Java Rupees per man ach month). The staple food was rice and fish.
The cost of 1 pond of rice (453.6 grammes) was 255 cents, 1 pond of meat was 1752 cents, 1 can of oil was 40 cents, and 1 pord of south coast salt was 0.1 cent (414 cent if it came from the north coast), whilst the cost of buying a pair of buffalo ranged from £.10.-16.00. Prices quoted here are taken from Dj. Br.
$2, A.M. Th. de Salis to H.J. Domis (Resident of Semarang), 14 Jan. 1823; A.H. Smissaert to Batavia, 21 Jul. 1823 and IOL Mack. Pr. vol. 2, p. 214.

71 panjangira mung sadhipa: A dhepa is one fathom, the length of the chest with both arms ourstretched (GR. vol. II, p. 360).

72 wus sakolah marang Bugis .....: besides the Balinese (see above n. 58), many Buginese also served as mercenaries at the Central Javanese courts and had an important influence on the marshal arts. The Sultan of Yogyakarta had two

Bugis regiments ar this time, the Daeng Secadipura with 106 men and the Bugis regiment with 40 (dK 145, Waterloo 'Memorie' (1808). In 1813, Crawfurd also

remarked on the number of Buginese who took service with the Sultan and P.
Prangwedana (Mangkunegara I!) (Dj. Br. 28. Crawlurd to Assey, 21 Mar.

1813). The Patih of P. Paku Alam I, Daeng Aria Natareja, was also of Bugis descent (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Comm. of Klathen, 3 Aug. 1825). In 1812 three

252

Babad Dipanagara

Buginese soldiers were sent to fire the powder magazine in the Dutch fort (BL Add. 12330 (Babad Bedhah, II. 28, f. 11r) and Buginese soldiers apparently joined Dipanagara at Tegalréja at the outbreak of the Java War (KITLV Or. 13 Buku Kedhung Kibo) IX. 11, p. 89). It is very likely that Dipanagara had Buginese to train his bodyguard (Kapédbak) because later, in his babad, he menuoned rwo Buginese captains, Rangga Dacng Makincing and Ngabehi Daeng Marewa, who fought for him during the war (LOr 6547 d, XXXIV. 31 p. 77).
On the use of Buginese soldiers by the Dutch see Louw, vol. I, p. 327.

* endha mêncak cara Cina: this refers to the pincak, the single stick fencing and swinging in a Chinese war-dance which is known throughout the Indonesian archipelago (GR. vol. II, p. 189, and for an excellent description of the origins of the present-day Balinese pFncak see De Zoete and Spies, Dance and Drama

in Bali, pp. 252-5). Single stick fencing was a great feature in Chinese monasteries from the sixteenth century onwards and the practice of it was combined

with the yoga-like exercises of the adept. The pencak was also practised in Javanese villages and was used in a peasant revolt in the early 20th century (see Sartono Kartodirdjo, 'Agrarian Radicalism', p. 115). It is interesting to note that the Kapitan cina of Yogyakarta, Tan Jin Sing, who was close to both Dipanagara and his father (HB III) at the ame of the Briush attack on Yogya (1812), apparently had the task, before the Java War, of maintaining Dipanagara's bodyguard (DK no. 181, Smissaert to De Kock, 13 Aug. 1825).

3 ingsun benggol kokok Kédbu'durjana ing Parakan: De Klerck (vol. V, Map) shows three places by the name of Parakan in Kedhu during this period. It seems likely that the place to the north on the road from Temanggung to Krtrteg is meant here. It would 'have been an ideal spot for wong dxrjana to operate, for the heavy traffic in cloth and tobacco between Bagélen, lédhok and Kédhu, could be easily robbed and the surrounding hills used as bandit hide-outs (MvK 2774, BGG ir, 3 Apr. 1821, no. 23; Afdeling Statstick, De Kador (Batavia, 1871). p. 96, Jav. Cour. no. 32, 13 Mar. 1828; Van der Kemp, 'Bricven' (1890),. p. 584). There was apparently trouble chere before the Java War because the Bupati of M&énoreh appealed to the Resident of Kedhu to improve the police force in Parakan so the inhabitants could be better protected (MvK 2774 BGG ir, 3 Apr. 1821, no. 23). During the Java War itself a local supporter of Dipanagara in Parakan, Sétradipa, murdered the Bupati Menoreh, R.T. Sumadilaga, and took the name of Tuménggung Kertaseluman

Sumadilaga (see Louw, I, pp. 310-20; IJ, pp. 90-91 and Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen , p. 70).

"5 nora pasah ing braja sisaning palu: Macan Sembawa is here boasting of his invulnerability. Followers of local Kyai in Java were often initiated into the esoteric arts of ngelmu kadigdayan (warlike virtues), ngelmu kawedukan (the art of striking fear), ngelmu (the art of invulnerability) and the use of jimats (charms, amulets etc.) and rajah (sacred texts) conferring protection from danger. Parakan was later renowned as a centre for charms and weapons (sharpened bamboo spears) bestowing invulnerability in battle (see Soejatno, "Revolution and Social Tensions in Surakarta 1945-1950, Indonesia, 17 (Apr.
1974), p. 104 and on the use of the Aji Limunan and other charms bestowing invulnerability in 19th century Java see Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving ', p. 82; Raffles HJ, vol. 1, p. 297). At another place in the babad (see below VIII. 15 and n. 168) Dipanagara's followers are described as having been given protection against bullets.

76 ..... èntulte muni dhbarudhut: continual breaking of wind in the Javanese context of a battle scene is not always the sign of flatulence or fear. In the wayang it is used as a means of self-defense by one of the most potent hgures, the

panakawan SE&mar (see Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese, p.
23).

Historical Notes & Commentary 77 maca tangawut ping tiga: this refers to the Ar. ta'awwndb Cl take refuge in God') from the prayer a wdhu billahhi min ash-Shuitan ur- Rujim (1 take refuge in God from the attack of the accursed Satan). a vulgar curse in Java expressing horror and disgust.

78 kongsi turun kaping pitu: the space of seven generations for an oath is a usual period in Java. Hence in 1763 Mangkubumi vowed that none of his descendants down to seven generations should marry a member of the Mangkun&garan family (note of Dr. G.W .J. Drewes and see Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 114 and p.
344), and later R. Adip. Cakranagara was promised that seven generation of his family should rule in Purwareja as Bupatis (see Carey, Javanese Histories, pp.
276-7 and Heather Sutherland, 'Notes on Java's Regent Families, part II, Indonesia, no. 17, pp. 4-5, see also below n. 178).

79 reyab-reyab fêleh-jileb ..... long hair was the mark of the satria warrior in Javanese sociery at this time and it was usually worn in a long coiled knot and tucked under the head-dress, hence the slight cylindrical protuberance at the

back of the blangkon (head-dress). Thus, at a Residency party in Surakarta, a European observer noticed how the Sunan's sons danced with their hair tied up behind their head in a large bun and secured by a semi-circular comb of tortoiseshell, see Anon, 'Excursion to the Native Provinces of Java', (1854) p. 84.
Short hair indicated either a sentri (student of religion) or one who was employed by the European government, thus Javanese troops who served the Dutch were recognisable by cheir close-cropped hair and during the 1812 crisis Yogyanese who sympathized with the British could apparently be picked out in the same fashion (Dj. Br. 22, G.W. Wiese to Daendels, 5 Dec. 1808; Poensen, 'Amingku II (Sepuh), p. 291). The Malays and Bugis also wore their hair short (see Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 89). During the Java War Dipanagara and many of his followers shaved off their hair as a vow after their victory at the battle of Kasuran (28 Jul. 1826) (see LOr 6547c, XXVII. 114-6, p. 177 and Louw, vol. II, p. 497). After this, Dipanagara described the contenders in the war as falling into three classes: the 'believers' (his followers) with shaven heads; the 'apostates' (those Javanese who fought for the Dutch) with long hair, and the 'unbelievers' (the Dutch and other Europeans) with close cropped hair. One Yogyakarta prince (P. Abubakar) even cut off his pigtail before joining Dipanagara at Sélarong at the beginning of the war (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 7 Aug. 1825) and Chinese who supported Dipanagara and embraced Islam were also ordered to have their pigtails cut, see Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVIIl.

80 aneng luhur papanggungan: papanggungan probably refers to a small building of wood or bamboo with one storey which is used in Java as an oratory (langgar)

(note of Dr. Th. G.Th. Pigeaud). It seems that such a building existed at Tegalréja for Brumund ('Bezoek', p. 194) noticed ruins on a small hillock amongst the sawah: just outside the village, shaded by rwo old kZ2maning trees with three yonis underneath, and, in his babad (LOr 6547 b, XX. 70, p. 335), Dipanagara referred to the gidhong (pavilion) at Selareja. From this place there was a commanding view over the surrounding countryside and it was from here that Dipanagara in his babad described how he first saw Danuréja's men working on the road (LOr 6547 b, XX. 70-2, pp. 335-6).

81 gumujeng akukub lathi: it is considered very bad form in polite Javanese circles to laugh with one's mouth open. The Javanese usually cover their mouths even if they do not laugh outright (note of Dr.Th.G.Th. Pigeaud).

82 panakawan kakalih: earlier (see above n. 44) Dipanagara is described as having

three panakawans. Here perhaps his two older retainers, Rata and Banthengwareng, are indicated.

Babad Dipanagara

" anggris munggeng patadhan: it was important for a Javanese leader to dispense largesse, especially after a successful battle. One of Dipanagara's panakawans later described how the prince used to distribute alms to the poor outside his pendhapa every Friday (Brumund, 'Bezoek', p. 189) and during the Java War, one of De Kock's spies reported a general distribution of money by Dipanagara at the Puasa festivities of May 1826 (dK no. 119, Report of R.Ng. Natareja,

19 May 1826; see also Louw, vol. 1, p. 259 for a description of the distribution of treasure after the ambush at Pisangan on 28 Jul. 1825 (see n. 230) and

Bat. Cour. 12 Apr. 1827 on the rules for splitting up booty amongst DN's followers in Kédhu in 1826-7). But some were obviously discontented with the amount given. Thus one follower described how he only received two silver reals from Dipanagara throughout the course of the war and how he was forced to sell his clothes and ornaments to maintain himself (NvB Port. 12, pr. 8, 'Verklaring van Raden Hasan Machmoed, een gevangen muiter', 1 Aug. 1829).
One enggris (inggris) refers to a reyal inggris, one real of silver money, worth + f.2.40 (GR. vol. I, p. 221 and De Haan, 'Personalia', p. 481).

"> wong sawijs limang reyal: hve reals (silver) (real batu) = £.12.00;, this would have been a very considerable sum during this period, see above n. ?0 and IOL Eur. F 148/4, Raffies- Minto coll. vol. 4, 'Memorandum on Currency and Coin",

pp. 173-4 for comparative prices, wages and monetary values.

85 kebon munggeng palataran: according to Javanese ideas a garden should be placed at the back of a house where the women can enjoy it. The front yard is open to the public and should be planted with trees. The latter is referred to here. According to Van Sevenhoven (KITLV H 503, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 108) the Yogyakarta Residency had a large ceremonial garden in the front with three ponds encircled by trees (see further Louw, vol. I, Map 3. complex C).

86 kadya yéhsendra Ngaléngkallduk myarsa patinirekilyaksa Ari Nglébur Gongsa: this refers to the scene in the wayang Zkow (plot 'Pjahipun Kumbakarna®' (the death of Kumbakarna), in the Ramayana cycle of plays, in which the king of Ngalengka (Ceylon), Rawana, hears of the death of his younger brother, Kumbakarna, at the hands of Lesmana. Kumbakarna's kas?kten (supernatural power) lay in the joints of his limbs and these had to be hacked off one by one before he could be killed. The laekor which relates this episode is rarely performed in Java so harrowing is its impact (see Anderson, Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese, pp. 64-71). The comparison of Dutch officials with the bute (giants) in the wayang or with Kurawa warriors can be found in other contemporary Javanese accounts (see BL Add. 12330 (Babad Bedhah) 1. 4, f. 4r; SB 144 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. III) III. 32, p. 10; Poensen, 'Amangku Buwana II (Sepuh), p. 241 and above n. 43 of the Introduction).

87 kadya wil Sang Pulunggana: Pulunggana is mentioned as a horse spirit with Gareng as his groom in a series of wayang plays concerning the panakawans (Pigeaud, Literature of Jara, vol. 11, p. 683; Id., vol. III, p. 352) and in the Kidung Lalémbut, BL Add. MS. 12289, Pulunggana is described as residing in Karta, Sultan Agung's former royal capital (see Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 405).
According to Ricklefs (Mangkubumi, pp. 27-31) Dutchmen in the late eighteenth century were sometimes perceived in a manner similar to that in which the Javanese viewed the panakawans, the clown retainers in the wayang. Thus individual Dutchmen might be cither humorous or worthy of respect. Here it seems that Smissaert is being made fun of by the babad writer. It is interesting to note that a contemporary Dutch official described Smissaert as 'a small, fat and shy man' and at another place as 'a weak and insignificant person'. (Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp, p. 143; p. 146 and see below n. 152).
Another contemporary compared him with Sancho Panza (see above pt. IV of the Introduction).

Historical Notes & Commentary

88 duk gendhong Sambs mamaling: it is not clear what particular wayang plot is

being referred to here though it may be a scene from the laken 'Samba Ngènglìng', see C. Hookyaas, 'Javaansche Uitgaven van Volkslectuur (Balé Poestaka), Djawd, jrg. 12 (1932) nos. 2-3, p. 98, or a Sala version of 'Samba Maling. Samba, the son of Prabu Kresna, is known in the Javanese wayang theatre as a handsome but feckless youth, renowned for his glib tongue and amorous successes (see Pak Hardjowirogo, Sedjarah Wajang Purwa (Jakarta, 1965), pp.
110-1). Ngastina refers to the royal capital of the Kurawas in the wayang theatre and the residence of Prabu Suyudana (Skr. Hastinapura) (GR. vol. II, p.
792). Sang Partasuta and Bambang Wilugangga are names for a son of Arjuna, possibly Abimanyu (GR, vol. 11, p. 58, p. 233; and sce further Jaarboek van het Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap, p. 374). Suralaya refers to the abode of the gods, the heaven of Indra (GR. vol. I, p. 771). For references to the phrase

"medal reksa saking gunung" in association with sons of Arjuna see A. Jonkers (ed.), Wangsatama Mamaling (Leiden, 1934), pp. 4-5.

89 Tawan Sifalye pan kadyal .....ldawa lumun cinarita: again the babad writer may

be referring to a scene from "Samba Maling". Madukara is a name for the abode of Arjuna (GR. vol. II, p. 493) and the phrase putra ing Madukara probably refers to a son of Arjuna. This allusion may have a connection with Chevallier's well known amorous exploits (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 313). The gayam tree is the Inocarpus edulis Forst. (fam. of Leguminosae) (see De Clercq, op. cit., p. 260) which has scented flowers and the flesh of the fruits are sometimes eaten or the pips cooked. Presumably an alcoholic drink can be distilled from it. It is worth noting that, according to Smissaert, Chevallier used to go for excursions around Yogya with the Patih during which he would drink alcohol in the open (vAE no. 28, Smissaert to King William. I. n.d. (? Sept.
1828)). The description given here in the babad may be drawn from this.

90 Ngabehi Wiraprana: in a Dutch source Wiraprana is referred to as 'the secretary

91

of Danuréja' (NvB 9.2, 'Dag-Register van den Assistent-Resident van Djokjokarta inhoudende santeekeningen nopens het gebeurde van den 16 Juli tot en met den 5 Augustus 1825, (henceforth Chevallier, 'Dag-Register'), entry of 16 Jul. 1825). He gave the news of the developments at Tégalréja whilst Danuréja was away supervising the construction of the road between Yogyakarta and Klathen (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', Wiraprana to Danuréja, ? 15 Jul. 1825 and see below n. 130).

..... kadanurjan: this refers to the dalem (residence) and offices of Danuréja IV, also known as the kparsban. According to Louw (vol. 1, Map 3, complex S) it was situated to the north of the kratof in the same site as it occupies today (1973). Like the gladhag, the Macanan corps were probably lodged near the képatihan, sec Jar. Cour. no. 27, 1 March. 1828.

92 denbucal mring sabrang-sébrung: the rumour that the Dutch were planning to

arrest Dipanagara and exile him overseas is related in the Baka (KITLV Or.
13, VIII. 30, p. 86) and in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XX. 59-61, pp.
330-1), where Dipanagara described how even before the question of the road had come up, he had been warned by the dismissed Yogya Pengula, Kyai Rahmanudin, that Dutch troops had arrived in Semarang to take him prisoner.
These were probably Dutch reinforcements for their campaign against Bone in South Sulawesi (1824-25) which left Java in Sept. 1824 and Jan. 1825 (see Van der Kemp (ed.), 'Brieven van en aan Mr van de Graaff , vol. I, p. 163; vol.
II, p. 226 n. 5). There was no intention of taking him prisoner at that stage. in his diary ('Dag-Register', 19 Jul. 1825) Chevallier stated that it was the Ratu Ageng and Danuréja who first suggested that Dipanagara should be arrested and the whole of 19 July was taken up with preparations for this without anything being finally achieved. At about the same time, a servant of one of the

Babad Dipanagara

European inhabitants of Yogyakarta took the news of Danurtja's and Chevallier's plans to Dipanagara (MvK 4194, 13 Mar. 1827, Lit. 31, no. 35, Ratu Ageng and R.A. Hascuran to HB II, n.d.). The following day, 20 July, the blacksmiths in Yogyakarta warned Dipanagara of the preparations for an attack (see below n. 156 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 392 who related that Chevallier had the idea of attacking DN on 18 July).

marang Kang Mas Adipatya/Sasradiningrat manawi: this refers to the Patuh of Surakarta, R. Adip. Sasradiningrat II (Jul. 1812-30 Jan. 1846) (Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p. 607). The title 'Kang Mas' (elder brother) is probably used

because Sasradiningrat was appointed earlier than Danureja IV, and because this is a Surakarta account (see above pt. IV of the Introduction).

Aa lalurunging pajembatan!.....!nagari Ngayogyakarta: from the time of the

95

Giyanti settlement (1755) to the redrawal of the boundaries between the courts in 1830-31, Yogyakarta and Surakarta lands in the richer central areas (n@gara

agung) abutted closely on each other. On this see Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p.
624; and above the Introduction pt. IV n. 33.

lumampah kalih ing tunggal: There were in fact no agreements becween the courts regulating co-operation over road construction at this time. Indeed, it was not until 12 Oct. 1840 (15 Ruwah A.J. 1768), when the Angger Gunung was promulgated, that the duties of local officials with regard to road maintenance were formally stipulated (see J.F.T. Mayor (Res. Sala) to G.G., 11 Feb.
1841 in AN BGG 17 Feb. 1841, no. 16 and Soeripto, Ontwikkelingsgang, pp.
163-7). Road construction in the period before the Java War usually required long negotiations which were often abortive, see MvK 2456 BGG br 4 Oct.
1820, no. 12 for co-operation between Surakarta and Yogya on the construction of the Tersana-Bulu-Rawa-Dalimas section of Daendels highway (postweg) on the north coast. It does seem likely, however, that Smissaert made some efforts at this time to put the roads in the Surakarta area into order for on 23 Jun. 1825 he announced his intention of visiting rendbs Suku and the eastern mancanagara provinces, and ordered Danurcja to see that the roads and bridges were passable (Av), p. cvi, Smissaert to Danureja, 23 Jun. 1825). Smissaert never left on his journey because of pressure of administrative work, but Danuréja did depart for Klathen to supervise construction (see above n. 90).

.... Kalng)jëng Tuwan: 'Honourable Sit, the usual Javanese address for the Resident which probably dates from the period of Daendels (see above n. 9).

96 Tuwan Gor Dbhitre ....; in the Yogya babad, Dietréc is also referred to as

97

basa Gor a reference to his first name of Godlieb (see above n. 31) (SB 135

(Babad Ngayogyakarta) vol. I, XXXL. 39, p. 125).

rereh ririb punikalpatitis sabarang lakulakedhik kang kalipatan: Danurêja appears to have enjoyed a high reputation in Surakarta and in another source he was praised by Sasradiningrar as 'an intelligent man, who, as well as being acquainted with the Javanese laws, customs and habits was also mindful of the needs of the Dutch government and his prince ..' (quoted in dK no. 111, 'Over het karakter van den Soesoehoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de prinsen en rijksgrooten', Nov. -Dec. 1829). This opinion was not echoed by the contemporary Dutch accounts, most of which refer to his laziness, revengeful spirit and besotment with women and riches, (see MvK 4132, Van Pabst, 'Nota' (1826); dK 111 Van Nes to De Kock, 16 Dec. 1829). The good account of Danureja in this babad may reflect his reputation in the Surakarta kepasikan (see the Introduction pt. III).

99 ..... ngulama: a learned religious scholar (usually in fgh law) is known as 3. in Arabic, as opposed to the lay folk who are known as 'awawm. The plural : -of "Elim", 'ulama" is used among non-Arabic speaking peoples, including -> Javanese, to indicate both singular and plural (see Juynboli, HMW, p. 25 -.

3). In Java the term ulama is sometimes used quite loosely to indicate a mlearned in some branch of Islamic science (GR. vol. I, pp.. 125-6) :: Yogyakarta the centres for the wlama were the pathok négara (lit 'the pillars : the state'), the schools (pordbok) where figh law was studied. At this time thes were Dongkelan, Kasongan, Papringan, Plasa Kuning and Purwareja (see A\ p.ic-iic, 'Opgave van den Pengoeloe der landen aan Priesters afgestaan vo<: het onderhouden van graven' (1832).

pradikan ....: this refers to the domains exempted from taxation by the Sultan

The taxes levied in the area accrued instead to the head of the pradikar domain, who was sometimes an wlamae or a Kyai, in return for services rendered or to be rendered. There were four main sorts of pradikan areas anc villages. (a) Mijen desas: which were granted to a particular person or family

The taxes from the village and the labour services were used for the upkeep of the incumbent. The grant usually lapsed on the death of the incumbent.
(b) Pakuncen desas: (from Jav. kuncs (key), hence jurukunci (key keeper), were villages freed from labour services and taxes in return for the upkeep of the graves of a ruler or wali (Islamic saint ), or for the upkeep of a religious institution. Usually there was no direct gift of land as in the pradikan desas.
(c) Keputian desas; villages where the wong putian (religious folk) as opposed to the lay folk (wong abungan) were assembled. These sometimes had a religious institution attached and services were remitted or land directly endowed.
(d) Pradikan desas: villages where the land had earlier been given by a Javanese ruler to a specially designated person and his descendants on condition that a religious school was maintained or a grave kept up. One of the most important schools (Wésantrens) at this time was Tegalsari in Panaraga, founded by Pakubuwana II (1727-49), which thrived under the astute leadership of Kya Hasan Bésari I1 (1800-62) and was described by Crawfurd in 1812, as the main centre in Java for teaching santris destined for the practice of fiqh law (IOL Mack. Pr. 21, J. Crawfurd, 'Remarks on the Nature and Condition of Landed Tenures under the Native Governments of Java', p. 251). It was also the main centre for the production of Javanese paper (@W/zwang) see Dr. S.
Kooijman, Ornamented Bark-Cloth in Indonesia, (Leiden, 1963) pp. 58-60, and further F. Fokkens Jr. 'De Priesterschool te Tegalsari", TBG, vol. 24 (1877), pp. 318-36, and [d.. 'Vriie Desa's op Java en Madoera', TBG , vol. 31 (1886), pp. 447-517. For a list of pradikan areas in Yogyakarta during the pre-1832 period see AvJ, pp. ic-iic, 'Opgave van den Pengoeloe der landen aan priesters afgestaan voor het onderhouden van graven' (1832) and for a later survey of pradikan villages throughout Java see Register betreffende de Vrijstellingen door de bevolking der Perdikan-, Pakoentjen- en Midjen-Desa's worden genoten , en de diensten en leveringen, waartoe zij verplicht is (Batavia, 1888).

.c. Kétib Modin: these are both mosque officials, the latter having the duty of calling the faithful to prayer (HMW, pp. 66-8; GR, vol. 1, p. 464, and GR, vol. II, p. 494). In his babad, Dipanagara mentioned that the K#i#bs, Modins and

trom Yogyakarta accompanied by the came to him at Sélarong Or 654° b, XXII. 89, p. 396).

- Kisi Pangulu: a Dutch source (KITLV H 76, 'Boedel van. (Sultan) Boewana IV', pt. 2) mentioned that the Yogyakarta Péngulu rallied *- Dipanagara with 42 of his followers, amongst whom were many mosque

'ncials. This is confirmed in Dipanagara's babad (see above n. 102). Dipa-zgara also referred to the old PZngula of the Ratu AgEng, Muhamad Bahwi, * hom he appointed as the commander of the Bu/kio corps (see Louw, vol. I, p.

:s). The erstwhile Pénguir of Yogyakarta, Kyai Rahmanudin (1812-1823), who departed on a pilgrimage (ha;) to Mecca shortly before the outbreak of

'te war (LOr 6547 b, XX. 65-9, pp. 343-5), was also a close friend of Dipanagara.

3 Nig: Nitipraja ...... this refers to the chief magistrate of Yogyakarta, the 4'etuna jaksa, who had a following of 26 officials (see above n. 12). A Dutch report (KITLV H 76, pt. 2) mentioned a certain Ngabehi Nitipraja as having 'oined Dipanagara and he is also referred to in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 c. XXXII. 54, p. 8). son, a dismissed pathok nigara, was appointed

as Dipanagara's chief magistrate in his father's place in c. 1828 (LOr 6547 d, XXXII. 56, p. 9 and see above pt. IX and n. 221 of the Introduction).

.. juru Suragama: this was a bodyguard regiment of the Sultan, made up of religious officials and sentris. In 1808 Waterloo (dK 145, 'Memorie') described the regiment as numbering 50 men armed with krsses, daggers and carbines, and dressed in long white robes (jubah), white turbans and white trousers.
They marched barefoot and were led by drummers, tambours and pipers.
Another priestly regiment was the Syramglan, which was very similar to the Sarnagama, and with which Dipanagara himself had close associations (see dK 165 'Translaat-verhaal Adiwinotto'). In 1808 the Surangstan regiment comprised 40 men, dressed in white jackets and long white pants (dK 145, Waterloo, 'Memorie'). They were described by LW.C. van den Berg as the 'court chaplains' (hofkapelaans) of the Sultan and there was a special Surenatan mosque near the kadipaten ('De Mohammedaansche Geestelijkheid', pp. 33-4). In the Buku both these priestly regiments are described as having gone over to Dipanagara at Tégalréja (KITLV Or. 13, TX. 11-12, pp. 89-90) and the desertion of 30 Hajis from the Swryazgama corps is mentioned by Smissaert (Dj. Br.
54, Smissaert to Ple Clercq (Res. of Kédhu), 6 Aug. 1825). Both the corps were reconstituted as personal bodyguard regiments by Dipanagara during the Java War (LOr 6547 c, XXV. 218-9, pp. 137-8; J4., d, XXXVIII. 10, pp.
201-2, and see A.S.H. Booms, Eenige bladzijden uit de Nederlandsch-Indische krijgsgeschiedenis, 1820-1840, uit de Mémoires van F.C. Crilly de Montela, (Amsterdam, 1911), p. 34).

106 »rirnaktn Walonda Cinal....Muchamad ingkang rinasul: the hope that both Europeans and Chinese would become Muslims and join Dipanagara can be seen in various contemporary documents. Thus, in his proclamation to the people of Jabarangkah (near the north coast), Dipanagara gave orders that Chinese

who embraced Islam should be spared (see Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVIII) and at the end of the Java War he expressed the hope that some Dutchmen remaining on Java would become Muslims (see Carey, 'Javanese Histories, p. 285, p.
287). The process of 'becoming a Muslim' was very simple: thus the Chinese had to have their pigtails cut off and be circumcised. One Dutch official, Lt.
Daniel Portier, who was captured by Dipanagara's troops was even given an administrative position after he had proved that he had been circumcised (@izslamake) and adhered to the articles of the faith (sahadat) (see below n. 244 and see De Graaf, 'De Regering van Sultan Agung, p. 102 for a discussion of Agung's attempts to have Dutch prisoners circumcised). There is also evidence

259

Historical Notes & Commentary

that some Chinese rallied to Dipanagara at various stages during the Java Wa: or supplied him with money and arms (see Palmer van den Broek (ed.) 'Geschiedenis van het Vorstenhuis Madoera', TBG, vol. 20 (1973), p. 561; AN BGG ir, 9 Jul. 1832, no. 5; Payen, 'Voyage', 17 Sept. 1825; Louw, vol. III, p.
444). Before the war a few Europeans and Chinese had apparently become Muslims for various reasons: thus the interpreter, Dietrde, was reported to bave been a devour Muslim (see Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 15) and the Yogya Kapitan cina, Tan Jin Sing, embraced Islam when he was appointed as a Taménggung in 1813 (see P.J. Veth, Java, vol. II, p. 307 and above n. 73).

But on the whole, in the early stages of the war, when Dipanagara was very much under the influence of his sant advisers, the conduct of the war was marked by considerable xenophobia and both Europeans and Chinese were particularly singled out for attack. Thus in Dipanagara's letter establishing Angawicana as chief of the bandit forces in the Yogya area (see above n. 36) there were special orders to go against the 'Dutch, the Chinese, the Moors (non-Indonesian Muslims in general) and all members of overseas nations'.
Similarly in the Arabic prayer used by Dipanagara's followers for the discomfture of their enemies, bitter hatred of all foreigners can also be seen (dK no. 167). In Kédhu and Pacitan, Chinese land renters (tax farmers), European

land tax inspectors and supervisors of cultures were attacked and killed (dK no.
182, P.H. Breton van Groll (Sec. of Kédhu Res.) to Batavia, 28 Jul. 1825; JK

no. 181, 'Report of J. Wormer, deputy inspector of cultures in Pacitan', 11 Aug. 1825). Likewise in the eastern mancanagara provinces, especially along the Sala river ar Ngawi and in Rembang, many Chinese were massacred in the carly months of the war (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 522-5, p. 545, p. 561, p. 584 and Payen, 'Voyage', 10 Aug. 1825 who noted: ... partout les Chinois sont massucré{ s): on n 'épargne ni ni enfants). Although the total Chinese population in Central Java was not large, in 1803 the Durch reckoned that there were some 25,000 Chinese pFrenakans (Chinese of mixed descent) domiciled in the area (Dj. Br. 47, M. Warerloo to N. Engelhard, 30 Nov. 1803), many were dispersed in the villages where they exercised considerable economic control over the local trade. Their activities as money-lenders and tax-farmers also added to local discontent (see Carey, 'Origins', pp. 65-7). Thus economic grievances deepened the widespread religious hatred of the Dutch and the Chinese. But later there were examples of tolerance especially amongst DNs court supporters: Dipanagara himself took a Chinese girl as his mistress (LOr 6547 c (Babad Dipanagara )

XXVIII. 13, p. 227; Louw, vol. II, p. 517 n.) and had a Bengali as his personal physician and herbalist (Carey, 'Sepoy Conspiracy', p. 310).

106a dadiya somodra sédya sun unduri; it is worth noting that Dipanagara's speech here stands in sharp contrast to his reply to the Rasx Adil, in his babad in which he begged to be excused from waging war because he was not strong enough to fight and could not bear to see death (see LOr 6547 b, XX. 16-17, p. 314; Louw, vol. 1, p. 131).

107 kastbur ing dalim kitablTanah Jawa Ratu Adil: the kitab mentioned here is almost certainly the Kitab Mxsarar, which contained the prophecies divulged to the legendary king of K&edhiri, Prabu Jayabaya, by the sage Maulana Samsu Jen from Turkey (Ngram). The prophecies depicted the cycles, based on the Hindu kali-yuga cycles, which after periods of decline would result in the appearance of a 'Just King', the Javanese Ratu Adil (see furiher Drewes, Drie Javaansche Goeroe's, pp. 130-7; Wiselius, 'DjájÍ Bâjá, p. 181; Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', p.
31 and pp. 53-4). Dipanagara clearly was aware of these prophecies because he later described them in Book I of his Makasar MSS. (see Makasar MSS. prt.
1, pp. 50-53).

Babad Dipanagara

* sc I anu sast Suraljumeninge Ratu Adil: historical evidence points to the fact =4< Dhpanagara was planning an uprising to coincide with the first month (S-. : the Javanese year Wawu (see above n. 34).

The Javanese year Waws may have also had connections with messianic expectations. It is signihcant, for example, that Raden Rangga's revolt :> Madiun, which was messianic in character, occurred in a Wawa year ~ov.-Dec. I8IOA.]. 1737) (see Poensen, 'Amingku Buwana IT, p. 200 ff.) any that in 1888 prophecies circulated in Java thar the end of the year Wawa would ~ the time when the kingdom of the Reta Adil would be established (see Sarsono Kartodirdjo, 'Peasants' Revolr', p. 272).

*12 ang sanak-sadberekipuntadbs Kyar Taprajani: see above n. 100. The two wns of Kyai Taptajani had sertled in Surakarta where they enjoyed the patronage of Pangeran Buminata and were later given 300 cacahs of land in the area.
Taptajani's sister was also married to Kyai Musa, an lama pradiken of Kìdhu, who together with his son, Kyai Iman Gajali, joined Dipanagara (see below n.
110 and Dj. Br. 49, M. Waterloo to N. Engelhard, 22 Jun. 1805).

.::: ing Maja Badkeran sampunIPulo Kadang samya nganti: Maja and Badheran were rwo pradikan villages in the Pajang area slightly to the north of Delanggu. Pulo Kadang was another pradikan village near Imagiri which is mentioned by Jayadiningrat as having given help to DN (see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 15; Jat. Cour. no. 9, 19 Jan. 1828; De Klerck, vol. IV, Map, and SW no. 88, Mas Pangulu (Surakarta) to Kyai Maja, n.d.). The rwo former villages were associated with Dipanagara's famous religious adviser, Kyai Maja, and his father Kyai Badheran (Abdul Ngarip). The latter was a K&ib Iman, who was named as ulama pradikan of Badheran by Pakubuwana IV (1788-1820). His tasks were to pray for the welfare of Surakarta, to hold religious services on Fridays, to give religious instruction to the santris of the village (according to De Stuers, Mémoires, p. 15, the village of Maja contained a large library of Arabic MSS.
which were used for public instruction) and to go to Surakarta whenever the Pengulu called a state meeting. Before his death he was given the village of Maja as an additional pradiken benefice and was buried there. His first son, Kyai Wirapatih, succeeded him as pradikan of Badheran and took over the title of Kyai Ketib Iman. His youngest son, Bagus Kalipah, was appointed as

261

Historical Notes & Commentary

pradikan of Maja and was entrusted with the instruction of the sanitrs. He became known as Kyai Maja, and like his father before him he numbered man: members of the Surakarta kraton amongst his pupils, exercising a great influence there, even at times gainsaying the authority of the Surakarta Penguis (LOr 6547 c, XXVII. 13-14, p. 188; NvB Port. 11, pt. 11, Report of Mas Pangulu and Sasradiningrat, Surakarta, Oct. 1828). He apparently carried letters from the Raja of Bali Buleleng to PB IV during the British period (1811-16 and was imprisoned by the British at the Surakarta kepasihan for a while. Later.
during the Java War, he was given a wife of Balinese descent by Dipanagars (Knoerle, 'Journal, p. 23). Dipanagara's connections with Kyai Maja stemme from the period of Nahuys van Burgst's Residency in Yogyakarta (1816-22), when he travelled on foor to Maja to find his eldest son who had become a pupil there (De Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI. pp. 744-5 and LOr 2182 pr.
3, 'Berigt omtrent Kyai Maja', 20 Oct. 1833). He was deeply impressed by Maja and summoned him to together with Kyai Kuweron from Kédhu at the beginning of the war (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 75-7, pp. 392-3), but he later fell out with him. Maja had never made the pilgrimage (be;) to Mecca.
but so perfect was his knowledge of the Qur'an and the rules laid down in it that even religious figures who had often been to the Holy City recognised his superiority (De Klerck, vol. V, p. 742). De Stuers (Mémoires, p. 15), however, remarked that Kyai Maja, who was about 36 years old in 1828 and was small in stature, had a very cruel character; it was he who organised the ambush which led to the murder of the Sultan's guardians in July 1826 and he exercised great intellectual and military ascendancy over Dipanagara (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 154; vol. III, pp. 60-63). Maja's family connections were extensive: he had a son(?).
Kyai Imampura, who studied at the pesantren of Tegalsari (LOr 2163 Kedhung Kebo) XV. 96-8, p. 198) and amongst his other relations who went over to Dipanagara were Ke&tib Iman Badheran, Muhamad Ngali from Karang, Tumenggung Resanegara from Pulo Kadang, Kyai Hasan Besari, Besari's son, Bagus Elias (Tumenggung Pajang) and Kyai Iman Gajali (a nephew of Kyai Taptajani). When Maja was captured by the Dutch in Nov. 1828 he had with him 19 followers from Maja, 3 from Pulo Kadang and 2 from Badheran (NvB Port. 11, pt. 11, 'Namen en woonplaatsen der gevangenen met Kijaji Modjo', 16 Nov. 1828, and for details on Maja's family see LOr 2168 no. 108; SW no.

111 jengkar saking jro nagari: see above n. 29.

112 ingkang rama aglis rawublKangjeng Pungran Mangkubumi: this refers to Mangkubumi's first visit to Dipanagara at Tégalréja on Thursday 14 July which was reported to Danuréja by Ngabehi Wiraprana (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissacrt no. 12, Mas Ng. Wiraprana to Danurgja, 15 Jul. 1825). During this visit, Wiraprana stated that Mangkubumi attempted to give Dipanagara 'good advice", but that the latter paid no attention because 'his thoughts were confused' (z//re gedachten verwardt zijn). Wiraprana reported that all the inhabitants at Tegalreja were making preparations for resistance, the twwmwa buru (tiger hunters) from Jélégong near the Praga river had been ordered to prepare their arms, various Puasa taxes had been remitted to Dipanagara's vassals to buy arms and food, and the wong durjana to the south of Yogyakarta had been summoned (see above n. 36). A Demang from the village of Grojogan in the Pajang area near Surakarta was also on the march to join Dipanagara with over 100 of his relations and followers (LOr 6547 b. XXI. 22-3, p. 344, NvB Port. 9, pr. 2, MacGillavry to Smissaert, 16 Jul. 1825; MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', MacGillavry to Smissaert, 19 July, 1825, and Aukes, Legioen, pp. 62-3 where the let262

ter is printed in full). Mangkubumi's visit to Tegalr&ja thus took place against a background of hardening resistance there (see also Payen, 'Voyage', 16 Jul.
1825; 18 Jul. 1825). According to the account given in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b. XXII. 24-36, pp. 390-3), Mangkubumi inquired of Dipanagara why there were so many armed men assembled and he was given the reply that they were there of their own free will because they had heard the rumour that the Dutch wished Dipanagara harm. Mangkubumi said that he knew nothing of this and asked his nephew to give the assurance that no incident would occur in Yogya. This Dipanagara refused to do unless Mangkubumi first gave the assurance that the rumour was false. When Mangkubumi in turn demurred, Dipanagara replied that the only promise he would make was that he would make no moves against Yogya unless he was himself attacked (see further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 333; Kielstra, 'Een en Ander omtrent Dipo Negoro', p. 412).

13 Pangeran AdinagaralAdiwinata satunggil: there is no mention in Dipanagara's babad that Mangkubumi was accompanied by these relations on his first visit.
The first prince was a younger brother of Dipanagara by another mother who joined him at Sélarong on 21 July and was given the title of P. Suryenglaga (see below X. 32; n. 214; Dwidjosoegondo. Serat Dkarah, p. 102; dK no. 158 'Naamlijsten van Djokjosche hoofden'). Adiwinata was a younger brother of Mangkubumi who also joined Dipanagara later at (Serar Dharab, p.
100; dK no. 183 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso'). Neither was therefore a son of Mangkubumi, but the term 'pxtra' is often used loosely in Javanese to indicate a blood relationship.

i+ aneng madyaning pandhapa: a large pavilion in front of the houses of Javanese chiefs and nobles where male guests are received (GR, vol. II, p. 200).
Brumund on his visit to Tégalréja remarked on the pendhapa which was large and spacious, and entirely built of stone ('Bezoek', pp. 184-5). In his babad, Dipanagara described how he met Mangkubumi in the p¥nabapae at Tégalreja

during the latter's second visit (see below VII. 11; LOr 6547 b, XXI. 59, p.
342).

aywa sulaya ing tekadinunggala sepati-wrip; such a reply in Javanese terms need not imply complete agreement. In the kraton, official sessions usually ended with a royal pronouncement of the consensus (mwpakut) of the meeting to which courtiers normally replied sendika (whatever you wish") Sometimes, however, individuals could respond with datan /éngguna ('1 will not oppose you') which often meant that opposition was a recognized possibility (see Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 24). In fact, Mangkubumi only made up his mind to join Dipanagara after his second visit to Tegalreja on 20 July 1825 and his mistreatment by Smissaert (see below ns. 134 & 141).

: 16 prajurit jro sudayeki: see dK 145, Waterloo, 'Memorie' (1808) for a discussion of the Sultan's bodyguard and full details on the state of che regiments in

1808. The Buky mentions that the Mantri Jero, Pinilih, Katanggung, Nyutra, Mandhung, Wirabraja, Brajataka, Suranata, Daeng, Pancas and Suryagama regiments went over to Dipanagara whilst he was still at Tégalrèja

(KITLV Or. 13, IX. 10-11, p. 89) and in his babad Dipanagara described how

the Pinilih, Mandhung, Mantri Jéro, Suryagama and Suranata were reconstituted under his command (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 88-94, pp. 54-35).

17 seba ingkang eyang sampuniPangeran Mangkualams: it is most unlikely that this visit to Paku Alam I1 (1813-29) ever took place. It is not mentioned in any of the Javanese or Dutch sources, apart from a small coloured drawing in the Buku (KITLV Or. 13, p. 107b) which purports to depict a meeting between the two men, but most probably refers to Mangkubumi's visit to Tégalréja. On the contrary, it seems that Paku Alam and his relations were foremost in

opposing Dipanagara. Thus, on the morning of 20 July, Paku Alam mobiised his 'Legion' (personal army) and this took part in the attack on (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 89, p. 359; MvK 4132 'Bylage Smissaert no. 12, Smissaert to Batavia, 20 Jul. 1825, but see Payen, 'Voyage', 23 Aug. 1825 who described PA's troops as being as useless as the bodyguards of the Preanger Bupatis: Dipanagara did, however, make one attempt to win Paku Alam over when he was at Selarong on 26 July, but this proved fruitless (Chevallier, 'Dag-Register , 26 Jul. 1825; Payen, '"Voyage', 26 Jul. 1825). It is also interesting to note that in his conversations with Knoerle ('Journal, p. 14) Dipanagara remarked that "Mangkubumi and Paku Alam had always been infuriated by the actions of the

government, but that they had not the courage to break with them.... This seems to confirm the description given here in the babad. It could be said that

Dipanagara's estrangement from Paku Alam was of long standing and went back to the troubles of 1808-12 when the latter was involved in intrigues against the Crown Prince, Dipanagara's father (see Poensen, 'Amingku Buwana II', passim). Paku Alam also suspected that the Crown Prince had arranged for his banishment to Batavia in 1811, an exile in which both he and his son nearly lost their lives (see Poensen, 'Amangku Buwana II', pp. 242-51; IOL Eur. F 148/24 pt. G, Crawfurd to Raffles, 13 May 1812). After 1812, Paku Alam became an intensely unpopular figure in the Yogya kraton and his appointment as Regent during the minority of HB IV aroused feelings of dismay (see Louw,

vol. I, p. 43 n. 1, quoting a letter from Garnham to Raffles, 24 Nov. 1814).
His corruption and abuse of his position was the reason he was not

appointed as Regent of HB V in 1822 (see MvK 4132, Van Pabst 'Nota' (1826); Louw, vol. 1, pp. 449-53).

rumaos gadhab nagari/iNgayogyahkarta punika: this refets to Paku Alam's unique position as an independent prince in Yogyakarta. Because of the Sultan's youth, he was the most influential person outside the kraton.

wus dadi bongsa Kumpeni: this refers once again to Paku Alam's position as an independent prince in Yogyakarta answerable directly to the Dutch Government rather than to the Sultan (see Van Deventer, Het Nederlandsch Gezag, pp.
333-5, and Louw. vol. II, p. 425 where Paku Alam is quoted as referring to himself as a 'GaupZrnZémen punya orang"). The term which is used here, dadi bongsa Kumpéni, is interesting as an illustration of the changing loyalties which many Javanese felt at the time as the power of the European Government came to be more firmly established in Central Java A somewhat similar phrase is used in the Buku when Cakranagara was presented with a military order by

Col. Cleerens in recognition of his help to the Dutch forces in Bagelen. LOr 2163, XLII. (Dhandhanggula) p. 532:

68. Saya kasih kabar sama Kyaylu sandenya jadi orang Blanda/sudah dapat bintang g&dhe/....

68. I give you the news Kyai,/it is as if you have become a Dutchman/for you have won the great medal/....

ingkang Ibu Sri Bupati: this seems to refer to the Ratu Agèng, the grandmother of HB V rather than to the child Sultan's mother, the Ratu Kencana. The former continued to be known as the [by Sorf (Queen Mother) in kraton circles

even after she inherited the title of Ratu Agìng on 21 May 1822 (28 Ruwah A.J. 1749) (see Av), PB V to HB IV, 28 May 1822; SB 136 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. II) XXXIII 9, p. 135; LOr 6547 b, XVIII. 125-6, p.
270). She was the daughter of the Bupati of Rajegwesi, R.T. Sasradiningrat, sister-in-law of Danurgja IV and stepmother (bz Kwalon) of Dipanagara.
Hageman characterized her as a sensible woman (Geschiedenis, p. 38), and as a senior guardian of the young Sultan she had influence in the kraton and often gave Dipanagara advice, attempting in the latter stages before the war to act as

A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran) p. 79, Ratu Ageng to Dipanagara, Sura A | 1751 (Sept. 1823); Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 310, pp. 380-81 and see below n. 145). Payen, 'Voyage', 6 Aug. 1825 described her as a woman of zreat dignity (sans avoir de beaux traits, elle conserva beaucoup de dignitt et reprticute fort bien). So it is likely that if this visit of Dipanagara to the kraton took place he would have met her. The Ratu Kéncana, a daughter of Danurtja II, carried little authority in the kraton and after the death of her husband (HB [V. suffered from periodic bouts of madness (see Dj. Br. 53, Smissaert to

Baravia, 28 Feb. 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 9 Aug. 1825; Hageman, Geschiedenis, p 40).

. pusaka wangkingan!......!Kyai Palered lan malih/Kyai Sangkélat pinundbut:

Kvai Plered is one of the three p#saka agéng (great regalia) of the Yogya kraton, the others are Kyai B&thok and Kyai Kopek. It is the weapon (a lance) sith which Ki Pamanahan of Mataram killed Pangeran Aria Panangsang of Jipang in A.J. 1471 (1549) (Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 75, n. 19). Kyai Sangkelat, a kris was a minor kraton pusaka earlier cafried by Mangkudiningrat I SB 135 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. 1) LXX. 23, p. 286, and LXXVIII. 13, p.
321). The sangkélar type of kris has thirteen curves in the blade (Huk tigawlas)

and is traditionally the weapon which is hurled into the waves at Parang Trius to summon the goddess of the Southern Ocean (Ratu Kidul). Dipanagara

appears to have taken these pwsakas to Têgalréja to wash them ceremonially sram) as an act of worship to heighten his resolve. Afterwards they were returned to the kraton (see Payen, 'Voyage', 6 Aug. and 21 Aug. 1825 who described how Kyai Plered and another pusaka kris were given to Wiranagara tor safe keeping). During the war Dipanagara took with him three personal pusakhas: Kyai Sarotama, a dagger (cundrik) which was worn by his wife, Ratu Kedhaton; Kyai Barutuba, a pike, which was given to the commander of the Bulkio regiment, and Kyai Abijaya, a kris which was worn by Dipanagara himself (LOr 6547 c, XXX. 73-4, p. 317 and see below n. 190). These were all melted down in 1827 to make one kris, Kyai Ageng Bandayuda, which

Dipanagara was subsequently allowed to take with him into exile in 1830, but which has since disappeared, see LOr 6547 c (Babad Dipanagera), XXX. 73-5, p. 317 and AN BGG br, 30 Apr. 1830 no. 1.

iker-ibtr wus lumaku: the sending out of letters from Tegalreja is confirmed in Dipanagara's babad and in the Buka (LOQr 6547 b, XXI. 34-41, pp. 346-8; KITLV Or. 13 IX. 6-9, pp. 88-9, IX. 34, p. 94; X. 9-16, pp. 105-7).
According to Dipanagara's account, his abdi-dalém, Wiryadikrama, was pressed by Dipanagara's followers for letters of authority (pragm). Even followers from far afield on the north coast and the mancanagara areas begged for such letters.
When the request was passed on to Dipanagara, he replied that he could not draw up the lerters because his seal was with Mangkubumi. Wiryadikrama then fetched the seal from Mangkubumi, who gave it up on condition that it was returned as soon as possible for it was used to seal state papers in Yogya. Letters were then sent out to all Dipanagara's army commanders as declarations of battle (sondha dadining jurit). The Buku adds the detail that Dipanagara urged the local commanders to gather together the village people and announced his intention of waging a Holy War (prang sabil) with himself as the Imam(head) of religion in Java, KITLV Or. 13, IX (Durma) p. 89: 7. ......

Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825). The earliest extant copies date from the time Dipanagara and Mangkubumi were at S&larong (dK no. 182, Dipanagara and Mangkubumi to the chiefs of Kedhu, 5 Besar, A.]. 1752, (24 Jul. 1825), and dK no. 132, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to Tumenggung Jayamustapa, n.d., see above n. 36). Dipanagara's seal at this time bore his

name: 'B.P.H. Dipanagara', but it was lost in the flight from T&galréja and later

a new seal was struck in pegon script with the title: Ingkang jumZnéeng Kangjéeng Sultan Ngabdul Khamid Erucakra Kabirul Mukminin Sayidin Panatagama ..

to Maj. H.F. Buschkens & Col. J.B. Cleerens, 17 Saban, A.H.
1245 (14 Feb. 1830).

123 Mértawijaya ing Bendha: Mertawijaya is referred to as R.Ng. Wiryawijaya in a Dutch report and he is mentioned by this name later in the babad (see below X. 19 and n. 202). Together with his brother, R.T. Sumadirja, he joined

Dipanagara early in the war. They were both sons of the district head of

Kradenan in S. Kedhu, R.T. Jayaningrat, who had been srripped of his position as Bupati of R&mame probably at the time of the British annexation in 1812.
The latter was also the father of R.T. Sumadiningrat, HB II's xenophobic army commander who was killed by the British in 1812 at the time of che storming of the Yogya court, see KITLV H 76 pt. 2, List of names of Yogya officials who followed DN; and KITLV H 97, p. 7, W.H. van IJsseldijk, "Korte Schets' (1798). Mertawijaya took part in the revolt of Dipanagara's great-uncle, Dipasana, in southern Kédhu in Jan.-Feb. 1822 (see Carey, 'Origins', p. 65) and was mentioned then as the Bik of the desa of Bendha and the only local leader who had not been caught (MvK 2874 BGG ir no. 12, 19 Mar. 1822).
His zeal could be partly explained by his brother's death and his father's loss of position. Dipanagara also referred to him in his babad and described his death in the fighting around Gerajen (Kulon Praga) in Feb. 1826 (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 160-7. pp. 65-67 and see Smissaert's remarks on DNs relations with Mértawijaya in vAE 28, Smissaert to King William I,? Sept. 1828.)

Bendha is a village in southern K&dhu (Prabalingga district) on a small side road leading from Blabag to Barabadur (see Louw, vol. III, Map 1), which was renowned as a centre of palm and peanut oil production (see Afdeeling Statis tiek, De Residentic Kadoe, p. 120). It was also close to the important religious school and mat weaving centre of PEésantren (see Raffles, HJ, vol. I, pp. 1667). Bendha was therefore in an area dominated by local Muslim traders who were bitter rivals of the resident Chinese in Kédhu. The whole district of Prabalingga was especially disturbed ar the time of P. Dipasana's revolt (Jan.
1822) and again in July 1825 when the failure of the rice harvest caused prices to rise from an average of f. 4 per pikal to f. 10 (dK 182, P. le Clercq to Van der Capellen, 29 Jul. 1825). The fact that many of the local Javanese officials appointed by the European government berween 1812-1825 were foreigners from the north coast (Semarang and Pekolangan) and not men from Kedhu compounded the difficulties. At the same time, the presence of numerous Chinese tax farmers who rented land from the ruler in the Yogya and Sala enclaves in S. Ködhu (see below ns. 227-8, 231) and the uneven demands of the land-tax (introduced by Raffles in 1812) aggravated local resentment (Carey, 'Origins', pp. 65-7; Afdecling Statistiekeo, De Residentie Kadee, p. 54, p.
78). The population of the district was c. 35,000 before the Java War and it was won over for DN by secret messengers dispatched by the prince. 100 of the Sultan's bodyguard who deserted to DN were also sent there to organise resistance. Land-tax posts were burnt and by 27 July the men from Prabalingga

Fusen Papak ingkang rayilputra Mangkudiningratan: this refers to the son of Mangkudiningrat I by an official wife (probably the daughter of R. Ayu Serang). who bore the name R.M. Papak (later R. Mangkudirja/P. Natapraja).
His father was the son of HB II who shared the Sultan's exile first in Pulau Pinang and then in Ambon where he died in Mar. 1824 (SB 136 (Babad N :sogyakarta, vol. II) XII. 10, p. 56). He left a numerous progeny, many of whom joined Dipanagara. These included: R. Mangkuwijaya (later P. Mang«udiningrat IN (41); R. Mangkudirja (R.M. Papak/P. Adipati Natapraja, see zelow n. 215) (21); R. Martaatmaja (later P. Aria Suryamataram see below n.
217) (23); R. Sasraatmaja (later P. Aria Pakuningrat) (22), the commander of Dipanagara's ferryboats during the war; P. Aria Pakuningprang (20), P. Aria Papak (21); P. Aria Jayaningrat (19); P. Aria Mélayakusuma (17); P. Aria Cakraningrat (24) (the figures in brackets refer to the ages of Mangkudipingrat's sons at the start of the war in 1825). All were born of unofficial wives except R. Mangkudirja (R.M. Papak/Natapraja), see dK no. 111, 'Nominative Staat van de Prinsen aan het Hof Djocjokarta', Nov.-Dec. 1829 and KITLV H 76, pr. 2, List of Dipanagara's supporters, (1825). Papak had debts in Yogyakarta amounting to Sp. D. 260 and had to pawn 1 jung of his land which may be one of the reasons why he and his elder brother Mangkuwijaya, decided to go over to Dipanagara. Both brothers also had grievances going back to the time of their father's exile in 1812. According to De Kock (dK no. 111 'Over het karakter van den Soesoehoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta, en de prinsen en rijksgrooten'), Mangkuwijaya and Papak had much influence in their lands to the south of Yogyakarta and had many Tamenggangs under them (see further Bas. Cour. no. 57, 30 Jun. 1827). On 2 Aug. 1825 they were already organising support for Dipanagara at the village of Tajém on the road to Klathen to the east of Yogya (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to commander of Yogya garrison, 2 Aug. 1825) and they. came to SElarong on 6 Aug. to receive their commands from Dipanagara (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 39, pp. 383-4, and see below X. 33-4; Louw, vol. I, p. 362 n. 1, p. 342; vol. II, p. 422, pp. 541-58).

ing Gondhang titindhibipun!......!lan Tumdnggung Sutadirja: Gondhang, Sumber and Kalasan are all three villages close to each other to the east of Yogya.
Gondhang is slightly co the north of che main Yogya-Sala road between Prambanan and Klathen (see below n. 130), Sumbér is on the Kali Opak slightly co the south of Kalasan which is between Prambanan and Yogya on the main road (Louw, vol. III, Map 1). R.T. Martalaya was a grandson of Pangeran Ngabehi and was appointed as a Nayaka (Bupati jaba) on 9 Nov. 1795 (AvJ, Van IJsseldijk to Van Overstraten, 9 Nov. 1795). He took part in the expedition against Raden Rangga in Dec. 1810 (SB 135 XL. 5, p. 158), but later suffered serious losses in landholding after 1812. He was mentioned by Smissaert as having raised support for Dipanagara at the village of Katintang to the east of Yogya on the road to Klathen carly in Aug. 1825 after he had submitted to Dipanagara at S&larong (sce further LOr 6547 b, XXII. 26, p. 310; dK no. 158 'Naamlijsten van Djokjosche hoofden'). R.T. Dipadirja and R. Ng. Sutadirja were sons of R. Ria the erstwhile Yogya Nayaka (Bupati jcro) and formed part of the Yogya Pergalu's following (KITLV H 76. pt. 2). They rallied to Dipanagara at Sélarong on 6 Aug. with their father and were later dispatched with Martalaya to carry the rebellion to Pajang (SB 136 LVI. 13, p. 250; LOr 6547 b, XXII. 27 pp. 380-1 and XXII 51, p. 386).

Historical Notes & Commentary

Kalasan Tumenggung kalih, ....iMudal lan Pangeran Surva-/negara ingkang nindhihi. Kyai Suranagara was from the village of Karongan to the east of Yogya just over the Kali Opak, and Surar&ja (Sutareja) was from Randhugunting just by Prambanan on the Yogya side of the Opak (SB 136 (Babad Ngayogyakarta, vol. II) LXVL 42, p. 304). They are both described in the Yogya babad as having gone over to Dipanagara and the latter is mentioned as the Demang of Kalasan who took part in the capture of R.M. Suwangsa on 28 Jul. 1825 (dK No. 183, 'Verslag van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825; LOr 6547 b.
XXII. 66. p. 390). Pangeran Suryanegara was a nephew of Dipanagara and son of Dipanagara's younger brother P. Adinagara. He was appointed as a Pangeran at Selarong and was given command of forces to the east of Yogya with Suranagara as his guardian (Zmban) (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 49, p. 386). Mudal cannot be traced but there is a village by that name mentioned in the Pajang area in 1770 (see Dj. Br. 41, 'Notes on the Book of Klépu', 1 Oct. 1770).

ing Pandbiés SasranigaralSasrajaya aneng Témbi: RT. Sasranagara was a son of the Lieutenant of the prajurit kraton Bausasra, and a son-in-law of Dipanagara's younger brother Adinagara. R.T. Sasra(wi)jaya was a son of the Yogya Bupati RT. Natadiwirya (NBS 133 (VIII), 'Staat der Prinsen met bekendstelling hunner vaders en schoonvaders', n.d. (21830), nos. 10 & 36). Pandhés may refer to the village marked as Pantés on the Sala Res. map, which is 4 kilometres due S. of Gondhang see IOR X.IX. 7, 'Topographische kaart der Res. Soerakarta', (1866). Témbi cannot be identified but is probably in the same area.

Suryadipura was a younger brother of Dipanagara, previously named R.M.
Gérantul, who was raised as P. Suryadipura at Sélarong in early August 1825 (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 92, pp. 396-7). Mangkubumi joined Dipanagara at Tegalreja on 20 July and Adinagara and Suryadipura fled w Sélarong on the night of 20-21 July (see Chevallier, 'Dag-Register', 21 Jul. 1825 and Payen, 'Voyage', 21 Jul. 1825).

138 para Nayaka samya: in his diary Chevallier mentioned that all the Yogya Tumenggungs had gathered in the morning at the kepatihan and that later

Danureja went to report to the Residency as the head of the Bupatis in Yogya (Dag-Register', 18 Jul. 1825). The Nayakas here refer not to the 8 Wedanas of

the Sultan (see above n.6) but to the various Dutch officials in Yogya and those Javanese most closely associated with them.

139 upas kantor kakalih ingkang dinuta: in his diary Chevallier referred to a letter sent by Danuréja which was taken by messengers (? Macanan) from the képatihan ('Dag-Register', 18 Jul. 1825), and according to Dipanagara he received a letter from Danuréja which he returned unopened (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 46, p. 349). Smissaert, however, in another letter to Dipanagara the same day, referred to Danureja's letter and Dipanagara's reply, in which the latter stated his fears that the Dutch and the Patih were planning moves against him (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert no. 3, Smissaert to Dipanagara, 18 Jul. 1825).
Smissaert's letter was received by Dipanagara through Mangkubumi's Patih, Sastradimeja (see above n. 35) on 19 July. Dipanagara replied to this the same evening in a non-committal fashion. The following day he wrote again to Smissaert refusing to come to the Residency because he feared arrest. He also demanded that Danurëja should be dismissed (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert, nos. 4-7, 19-20 Jul. 1825; vAE no. 28, Smissaert to King William I, ? Sept.
1828). Correspondence between Dipanagara and Smissaert can also be found in Yogya kraton MS. A. 62 (Babad Dipanagaran) p. 134 and pp. 137-8, bur both these sources contain recensions which are very far from the originals (on this

episode see further Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 393-4 and Hageman, Geschiedenis , p. 66).

141 mangkat Pangeran Mangkubumilmring Tigalreja: Smissaert's impolitic handling of Mangkubumi and his decision to make him responsible for Dipanagara's actions was the main reason Mangkubumi decided to stay ar Têgalrëja during his second mission on 20 July 1825. According to the latter he feared the anger of the Resident (LOr 2168 no. 11, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, n.d., p. 6, .... mila kula tumut lélampahanipun Ki Arya Dipantgara amargi saking dukanipun Tauwan Residhen ..... ) and thus did not return. In another letter, Mangkubumi stated that he had invited the Resident to go with him but Smissaert had refused and did not even permit S&cadiningrat (Tan Jin Sing) to accompany him. Despite his advanced age he had been forced to go to Têgalreja alone (see Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage LVI, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, 9 Sura A.J. 1753 (23 Aug. 18259), pp. 727-9). Mangkubumi's account is largely confirmed by Chevallier, whereas Payen, 'Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825, mentioned thar Chevallier himself had offered to accompany Mangkubumi to T&galr&ja but that the latter had persuaded Chevallier not to come because he

feared for the Secretary's life. Smissaert's action was later cited by De Kock as one of the reasons for the Resident's dismissal in Sept. 1825 (dK no. XLV).

appears from this babad. He sent a joint letter with Dipanagara to Smissaert the same day stating that he was afraid to meet him again because Dipanagara could not be won over and both Dipanagara and himself only wished for Danurgja's dismissal (MvK 4132. 'Bylage Smissacrt'. no. 7. Mangkubui and Dipanagara to Smissaert, 20 Jul. 1825). See further Yan der Kemp. 'Hamlettype', p 395.

Hence the Besluiten ran den Gouvernenr-General in raad (in Council) and better raad (out of Council). The Council is usually referred to as the Rad Pini or Raténi in the babads and it was an institution which fascinated the Javanese because of its similarity with the Nayakas and the system of mupakatt consensus) which had to be achieved between the Wedanas in order to approve royal décisions (see Ricklefs, p. 396 n. 68).

konca kawula BupatilMas Tumenggung Sindunagara lan/urdinas Wlandi &anthine: this refers to R.T. Sindunagara, a Yogya Nayaka (Bupati jaba).
According to the other sources he was not accompanied by any Dutch officials, but by Mas Aria Mandura, the Wedana gladhag (SB 136, XLVIII. 52, p. 205); Chevallier, 'Dagregister', 20 Jul. 1825; MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see below XII. 23). According to Dipanagara during the day (20 July) various messengers had arrived from Yogya: first a Dutch orderly from the Residency (erdénes saking Loji), then a messenger from the Ratu Ageng in the kraton named Kyai Suranata, and finally R.T. Sindunagara and Mas Aria Mandura (LOr 6547 b, XXI 92-114, pp.
360-5). It is possible, therefore, that the account given here in the babad has confused the visits. In his babad, Dipanagara described how the first two messengers were sent away. The latter, however, carried a letter from Smissaert inviting Dipanagara yet again to come to the Residency in order to clarify a 'difficult case of state law' and informing him that a carriage would be sent to fetch him (Yogya kraton MS. A. 62, p. 135, Smissaert to Dipanagara, 20 Jul.
1825. .... wonten prukawis rumpil sanget bah adil khukhuming negara. ewer pambingkasipun, punika saudara kula aturi rawuh ing Loji .... saha kula aturi pethukan kareta sarenga pun Tumenggung Sindunagara (lan; pun Tumenggung Riya Mefn/dura.) Dipanagara thereupon invited his younger brother. Raden Rangga. to read him the letter but on hearing it he reiterated his refusal to go to the Residency, exclaiming that he was not a child to be threatened (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 110 ....lsan duda bocahipan arip denapusi. Compare this with the passage below in this babad, VII. 24 ...!... dhek ciliklmamideni yen gawe parentabl...). Sindunagara asked him to put his reply in writing, a request which Dipanagara initially refused, but then complied with after Mangkubumi had prevailed on him just to reiterate his demand that Danuréja should be dismissed (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 113, p. 365). This was a significant development which could have been the basis for further negotiations. The Byk#y even mentions that Dipanagara was willing to meet Smissaert (KITLV Or. 13, IX. 63, p. 98), but hardly had his scribe written five lines of the reply than there was the sound of firing outside. Unbeknown to Sindunagara and Mandura their mission had been followed up almost immediately by a military expedition which just at that moment came into contact with Dipanagara's men (see below ns. 176 & 185).
Sindunagara and Mandura begged leave to depart. Thus ended the last attempt to bring Dipanagara over (see further Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVI, pp. 727-9, Mangkubumi and Dipanagara to De Kock, 9 Sura A.J. 1753 (23 Aug. 1825); Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 397-9; Hageman, Geschiedenis, p. 71 and Nahuys van Burgst, Verzameling, vol. 1, p. 21).

Historical Notes & Commentary

146 Kangjing Pangran Arya Mangkubumil...../Pangran Suryadipurane: Mangkubumi

visited Dipanagara alone on 20 July. His two relations joined the princes at Sélarong on 21 July (see above as. 129 & 141). In the account given in Dipanagara's babad (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 58-68, pp. 352-4), Dipanagara described how he met Mangkubumi in the pendhapa at Tegalreja at 8 a.m. (see above n. 114) and was asked once again to go to the Residency. The prince replied that it was no longer for him to decide because he had become the property of those gathered at Tegalrgja (XXI. 62, p. 353, sampun dados melikipun tiyang tuna pribadi/...) and told Mangkubumi to ask them whether they would allow him to go to the Residency. This Mangkubumi did and was met by unanimous refusal from Dipanagara's followers, who pledged themselves to fight. Mangkubumi then related that he could not go back to the fort because he had been made responsible for Dipanagara's actions. He described his meeting with Smissaert (see above n. 134) and at last decided to go over to his nephew. At the same time, he gave orders to his Patih, Sastradiméja, to bring over his wives and children (LOr 6547 b XXI. 92, p. 360; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 394, p. 404).

147 jaman awal Bragola Pathi: According to Babad Tanah Jawt texts, which were

148

probably the main source of the knowledge of these episodes in the Central Javanese kratons in the early nineteenth century, there were two rebellions by Pathi (krama: Santenan), both led by men called Adipati Pragola. The first was against Senapati of Mataram (21574-1601) in 1600 and the second was against Sultan Agung (1613-45) in 1627, which ended with the complete destruction of Pathi (see Olthof (ed. and trans.), Babad Tanah Jaws, (Jav. version), pp.
110-2, pp. 129-31). The repetition of this event in the babads is one of the pieces of evidence used by Prof. C.C. Berg to argue that the history of Senapati is merely an antedated version of the history of Sultan Agung (see C.C. Berg, "Twee nieuwe Publicaties betreffende de Geschiedenis en Geschiedschrijving van Mataram', Indonesië vol. 8 (1955), pp. 97-128 and see further Ricklefs, Modern Javanese Historical Tradition (London, 1978), p. 174).
There is some doubt, therefore, whether in VII. 15 (-g .... /bongga mring eyangiralKangjéng Sultan Agung!..... actually means Sultan Agung or 'the grandfather of Sultan Agung (i.e. Senapati). The history of Adipati Pragola and his bravery was also enshrined in the lay of Pra»acitra, the ballad of a beautiful maiden captured in Pathi during Agung's expedition (see De Graaf, GJ, p.
110). It is possible that the episode was also known through this source which enjoyed widespread popularity in the nineteenth century amongst Javanese literati see Pigeaud, Literature of Jara, vol. I, p. 258; on the historical background see De Graaf, 'Senapati', pp. 127-32; d. 'Sultan Agung', pp. 135-43).

mungsuh Deler Panemuf: this refers to the revolt of Mangkubumi (HBI) against Sunan Pakubuwana II (1727-49) and the Dutch in 1746-55. It originated partly because of the decision of Governor-General G.W. van Imhoff (174350) to support Pakubuwana II's Patih, Pringgalaya, in his argument that Mangkubumi should not be given control of Sokawati after the area had been promised to him as a reward for expelling the rebel R.M. Said (see Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, pp. 40-6). Mangkubumi's rebellion ended with the treaty of Giyanti (13 Feb. 1755) by which he was recognised as an independent ruler in Yogyakarta sharing half of Central and East Java with the Sunan. Later, other independent principalities were carved out for the Mangkunggaran (1757) and Paku Alaman (1813). The oath referred to in VII. 17 is the one which was taken by Mangkubumi on 13 Feb. 1755 before the treaty of Giyanti was signed. A copy of the Qrr'an was held over Mangkubumi's head and he swore that God and the Prophet Muhammad would curse him and his descendants if they every broke the agreement. Later, just before his death, Mangkubumi reminded his children that they should always remain loyal to the V.O.C.
(Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 72 and pp. 354-7). Haméngkubuwana II swore a

272

Babad Dipanagara

similar oath to the Dutch Company on his accession in 1792 (see Rothen>uhler, 'Dagregister', p. 323). The example of the first Sultan was clearly an important one for Dipanagara for he described his meeting with him when he was still a child in arms (see LOr 6547 b, XIV, 45-6, pp. 114-5). Similarly, in a letter written during the Java War by his Patih, Dipanagara stated that he wanted the Europeans to recognise him and submit to his authority just as they had done under the rule of his grandfather (sic) Sultan Hamengkubuwana I 1749-92), (LOr 2168 no. 48, Pangeran Nir Adipati Ngabdulsalam Suryenglaga to Seh Ahmad Bin Ali Ketib, 10 Rabingulawal. Ehe, A.H. 1244. (19 Sept.
1828).

< . ninggib Mas Tuniëngeung Sindupraja: this refers again to R.T. Sindunagara (see above n. 145); nagera and praja are interchangeable in Javanese, but the latter is used here because of metrt causa.

"> ngapurancang astanira kalih: Sindunagara delivers his speech to Dipanagara with his hands clasped in front of him as a sign of great humility and respect.
This stands in sharp contrast to Dipanagara's reply which is in ngoko (Low Javanese) with many insulting expressions.

"1 denngantiya fiblog kang margi: this refers to the period of the west monsoon in Java (October-April) when country roads such as that leading to Tegalreja often turned to mud during the prolonged rains. It was then July at the height of the dry season (east monsoon) (but see below n. 185). The expression is used here to give force to Dipanagara's refusal and to indicate that no matter what lengths Smissaert went to, Dipanagara would still not oblige him by coming to the Residency. This was not in fact Dipanagara's intention according to other accounts (see above n. 145).

: 53 mring si buthuk-ngelathak ...... this refers to Smissaert who was apparently bald.

Dipanagara's use of insulting expressions (les expressions les plus basses de la langue Javan[aisle) to the Resident and Chevallier at a party in the Yogya fort given by the Resident on 21 May 1825 for the Garìbig Pyusa was mentioned by Payen ('Voyage', 18 Jul. 1825). At that time Dipanagara had spoken to the Dutchmen in ngoko (low Javanese) and had called Smissaert 'the bald-headed one' (see further Louw, I, p. 47 n. 1; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp. 34041 and Van Pabst, 'Nota' (1826).

153 langkung karsa Kangjing Tuwan!.....!mimilibha Wilandi ingkang denutus: chis episode is described rather differently by Chevallier in his diary in which he made it clear that Smissaert had no intention of leading the expedition in person, but rather showed himself as a coward in public ('Dag-Register', 22 Jul.
1825). His entry for 25 July described him as *..... timid and fearful, he had completely lost his head and through his actions increased the confusion and muddle from hour to hour ...' ('Dag-Register', 25 Jul. 1825 and see above n.
141 concerning Mangkubumi's advice to Chevallier). Smissaert was greatly censured by contemporaries for not having gone personally to win over Dipanagara (vAE 28, 'Stukken betreffende het ontslag van A.H. Smissaert', Besivit van

den Minister van Marine en Koloniën, 13 Oct. 1829 no. 1; NvB Port. 9, pt. 3, Nahuys van Burgst, 'Onlusten op Java'). Willem van Hogendorp also castigated the 'miserable artitude of Smissaert during the three days before (Dipanagara's) rebellion' and commented that if Nahuys van Burgst had still been Resident, 'he would have written less and would have gone in his own carriage to ferch 'Dipanagara from Téegalrìja' (H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp in Nederlandsch-Indié, 1825-1830, pp. 147-8). Smissaert later excused his behaviour by citing the example of the Resident of Bantén, P. du Puy, who had been murdered in 1808 and whose death had been the signal for a general attack on Europeans in the Residency (vAE 28, Smissaert to King William 1, ?

154 Katanggung myang Jaga-upa: on the Jaga-upa regiment, see above n. 44, The members of the Katanggung wore uniforms of black lacquered breeches, blue striped jackets and leather boots. Of the 205 men who made up the regiment, 100 bore pikes and 105 carried carbines, as well as dragoon sabres, pistols,

krises and cartridge pouches (dK 145, Waterloo, 'Memorie' (1808). Only a few took part here, see below n. 156.

155 Surabraja ...:; this refers to the commander of the Brajataka regiment who later deserted to Dipanagara, see below n. 163.

156 samaktaa ing prang pupubi.....\kingriga mring Tégairéja sadarum: On the morning of 20 July Chevallier noted in his diary that Wiranagara had asked him for some ball cartridges (scherpen patronen) for the Sultan's troops ('Dag-Register', 20 Jul. 1825). Sometime previously the Sultan's bodyguard had been reequipped at the request of Mangkubumi and Dipanagara with 200 English muskers and bayonets and 100 sabres (MvK 2476, BGG br 7 April 1824 no. 20).
According to De Salis (MvK 4207, 'Pro Memorie', 8 May 1828), Wiranagara later supplied gunpowder and lead to Dipanagara when he was at Sélarong. It seems, however, that only a few of the Sultan's troops took part in the expedition: Smissaert mentioned a mere 24 dragoons under a Dutch officer and a few prajurits under Wiranagara (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 12 Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825. See further Kielstra, 'Een en Ander omtrent Dipo Negoro', pp. 412-3).

157 .... densongsongilijo padhang bulan ....: a green payung (state umbrella) with gold bands was carried by the children of bupatis if they were born of a Rare (princess) (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 498 n. 1; KITLV H 139 'Namen en Eer Tituls der kinderen van den Sultan, Prinsen en Regenten te Jogjakarta', n.d., and GR, vol. II, p. 316). Wiranagara would have been entitled to this distinction

because of his rank as wedana gedhe prajurit rather than to his birth (see above n. 41 and below n. 178).

158 prajurit kulit pithak/sabrigada Kump(@ni plangkir solahadbu: according to Smissaert in his letter to Van der Capellen on 20 Jul. 1825, 25 Dutch infantrymen (Dutch: flankeur. hence Jav. plangkir) under 2nd Lt. van der Plas, 2 cannon (one pounders) under 2nd Lt. Mossel and a detachment (25 men) of the 7th Hussar regiment under Lt. Thierry were dispatched to Tegalreja. See also Louw, vol. I, p. 256 and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 402.

159 Kumpni slam catur-dé&i: this may refer to the squadron of 25 mounted troops recruited from the sons of Dutch, German and Ambonese residents in Yogya.
These had served in the kraton as a lifeguard for the Sultan since the incrigues of the Sunan with the Sepoys in 1815 (NvB Port. 5, pr. 2, Nahuys van Burgst

to Van der Capellen, 11 Aug. 1816; AvJ Nahuys van Burgst to the Commander of N.I. Army, 25 Oct. 1819). Nahuys referred to these as 'Christian troops' but the phrase 'Kumpéri slam' is often used quite loosely in Javanese to indicate Indonesian troops from Madura, Sulawesi and Bali who fought for the Dutch in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. See further BL Add. 12303,

f. 127v, and Jar. Cour. no. 85, 17 Jul. 1828, where the phrase pranakan slam is used.

160 Tuwan Suketaris Sifalye ranipuni.....initih kuda dhawuk putih: Smissaert later confirmed that Chevallier had been given overall command of the expedition in his letter to Van der Capellen on 20 Jul. 1825. Chevallier had earlier had a military career retiring from active service as lst Lieutenant in Jun. 1822 to become Secretary of Banten (see above n. 31). He is depicted wearing his hus274

Babad Dipanagara

sar uniform during the attack on Tégalréja in a coloured drawing in the Buku KITLV Or. 13, p. 99b). Later both Smissaert and N. Engelhard blamed him tor overriding the advice of Thierry and being too precipitate in attacking DN's <..im before it had been properly surrounded, see vAE no. 28, Smissaert to

King William I, n.d. (? Sept. 1828) and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp.
101-4.

this refers to one of the Sultan's regiments which numbered "O men, (Dj. Br. 29, 'Statement of annual expenditure in the Cratton', 1 Dec.

1814) and which is mentioned as the Prawiratama in the Yogya babad (SB 136 L 45, p. 218).

- .... Brajataka: this may refer to the group of soldiers in the kraton who were entrusted with the guarding of the third gateway leading to the northern a/«»3!un named the Brajanala (GR, vol. II, p. 678; Winter, 'Beknopte beschrijving", p. 35). The regiment is mentioned in the Yogya babad as having taken part in the first expedition against S&larong (24 Jul. 1825) (SB 136, L. 45, p. 218).

* Surabraja aranipun: the episode of the desertion of a Lurah of the Sultan's praturits and his troops to Dipanagara at Tegalreja (see below VIII, 24-43) is confirmed in the other babad accounts except that the names used are somewhat different. All end with the death of the Lurah during the fighting against the Dutch (see SB 136, XLIX. 34-9, pp. 208-9; LOr 6547 b, XXI. 120-134, pp. 367-70 and KITLV Or. 13, IX. 69-73, pp. 98-100). Smissaert also referred to the fact that some of the kraton troops and their officers had refused to take part in the expedition against Tegalreja and had gone over to Dipanagara (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 404), Others wear over in August (see Louw, vol.
I, p. 300).

1.4 rasukan sukilat abangisabuk cindhe rineda sri: originally Jav. sakilat derived from Ar. sakhla (lamb's wool cloth) (GR, vol. I, p. 895), but here almost certainly refers to linen or cotton cloth which was dyed in three main colours (red, green or black) at this time. Cirndhe is the name of a flowered silk cloth woven

in Central Java out of the 80 chests of raw silk imported annually from China (GR, vol. I. p. 247; dK 145 Waterloo 'Memorie' (1808).

105 denira arsa tinundhunglaking ing see above ns. 34 & 92.

i6G gagaman sampur malatar: see above n. 156. According to Dipanagara his men were mostly armed with staves and slings, the latter being the most common. It was not until he reached S&larong that he began to gather weapons (see De Klerck, vol. V, p. 745; Payen, 'Voyage', 24 Jul. 1825 and on the use of armaments and tactics during the war itself see De Stuers, Mémoires, pp. 4-10). At the beginning of the war Kutha Gedhe was used as the main armaments centre and shot and gunpowder were manufactured there (LOr 6547 c (Babad Dipanagara), XXIX. 42, p. 276, NvB Port. 12, pr. 8, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Machmoed, een gevangen muiter', 1 Aug. 1829). Gunpowder was also purchased from other areas, presumably from the north coast where there was a thriving local armaments industry (Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 296) and from Banyuwangi, where sulphur for the manufacture of gunpowder was produced on the ljén plateau (IOL Mack. Pr. 14, Mackenzie, 'Report', p. 253; Raffles HJ, vol. I, p. 180). Jayamenggala, the Demang of Samen (see above n. 36) was especially renowned amongst Dipanagara's followers as an expert in gunpowder manufacture (NvB Port. 12, pt. 8, "Verklaring, 1 Aug. 1829 and Louw, 1, p.
207). The Dutch government also suspected erroneously that Dipanagara had acquired gunpowder from Sumbawa and Lombok (see Knoerle, "Journal", p. 32) and there were rumours that an English or American smuggling brig had supplied Dipanagara with arms at the mourh of the Praga river, see Anon.

kerig tan ana kang kantunidalah pangindbungira: see above n. 133. kerig refers to the able-bodied men of a district or a village (GR. vol. 1, p. 441) and here includes the men from the villages surrounding Tégalréja as well as the Magérsari and Kapedhak (see above ns. 45 & 47). The pangindhung refer to the share-croppers (orang menumpang) who helped out for harvest work in the neighbourhood (GR. vol. I, p. 35). Later, Dipanagara reckoned that in all there were about 1,000-1,500 people with him ar Tagairéja during the Dutch attack

mostly armed with slings and staves (De Klerck, vol. V, Bijlage XXXVI, p.
745, Louw, vol. 1, pp. 256-7).

..... sadaya samya tininbul see above n. 75. The use of jimats (charms and amulets) in order to give invulnerability was certainly widespread amongst Dipanagara's followers. Jimats of wood and strips of paper with Arabic and pegon characters were apparently distributed before battle (see Aukes, Legioen, p. 74). Many of the banners carried by DNs troops were regarded as being

magically powerful and were decorated with crescent moons, snakes and sentences from the Qur'Zn (Booms, Eenige bladzijden, p. 34 and Jar. Cour. no. 123,

20 Oct. 1829). DN's own bartle banner was green with a black disc in the

centre (see Louw, vol. II, p. 283 who described it during the storming of Plered in Jun. 1826). The copy of a Tagreb text owned by Kyai Melangi also contains rejah (sacred formulae) at the back (this is now in the Kamar Dipanagara, Karesidenan Lama, Magelang). Later in the war, Kyai Banjarsari trom Madiun begged Dipanagara for 'a jimat of his blood' in the shape of his own sister, R. Ayu Sasradiwiria, to reinforce their family ties with him (dK no.
124, R. Ayu Banjarsari and Kyai Banjarsari to Sultan Seh Ngabdulkamit, 11 Sapar, Jimakir, A.J. 1754 (7 Sept. 1826) and see Louw, vol. II, p. 568).
Dipanagara was himself believed by his followers to be endowed with special powers: thus Smissaert related reports that people believed the prince could fly, make it rain or be dry (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825) and at the battle of Gowok (15 Oct. 1826) he was used as a shield by one of his relations (LOr 6547 c, XXVIII. 40, p. 236). Dipanagara was wounded in the left thigh and above the right chest in the same battle (LOr 6547 c. XXVIII.
53-4, pp. 240-1; Bat. Cour., no. 49, 8 Nov. 1826 MvK 4192, Du Bus to

Minister of the Colonies, 6 Nov. 1826), but according to Dipanagara's later testimony these bullets shattered on impact and left no scars on his body, a

proof of his invulnerability (see Louw, vol. 1, p. 151; vol. II, pp. 516-7; De Klerck, vol. V, p. 745 and see further Payen, 'Voyage', 3 Sept. 1825 quoting a letter of Smissaert to Res. of Kedhu, n.d., in which he reported that DN's supporters had the belief that Dutch gunpowder and lead would turn into water).

Pangeran Dipantgaralwus angrasuk busananing prang sabil: this refers to the turban and jubah (long Arabic tabard with wide sleeves) which DN usually wore into battle. What purports to be DN's jubah is now on display in the Kamar Dipanagara (Dipanagara room) in the old Residency house at Magélang.
Smissaert confirmed that Dipanagara wore this during the fighting at Tégalréja for he described him as being dressed in a very distinguished white Arabic 'priestly' garment and ringed by men armed with lances (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see also

- ner occasions DN was described as being dressed like a 'priest' with a of black cloth and a black or green turban. He also sometimes wore a =-« ts441a (upper garment) of the same colour, (see Jar. Cour. no. 114, 29 :>: 1829 and Louw, vol. I, p. 487; vol. II, p. 384). At the battle of Gowok .* kt. 1826), when he was wounded, DN covered his distinctive green turban s= his handkerchief in order to disguise his plight from his troops (see Louw, s - I. p. 519). Although Sultan Agung (1613-45) also used to wear a turban -- . battle (De Graaf, 'Sultan Agung", p. 138), the normal Javanese courtly bar~- iress (prajuritan) was very different (see GR, vol. II, p. 241; Raffles, HJ, r . 1. p. 90 and Ricklefs, Mangkubumi, p. 60). It is unlikely that Dipanagara caned three Arises, the normal number for the prajwritan was two, one tucked -» the belt and one hanging on a beit. Thus, in a Dutch account, Yogya zoles were described as going about armed with two krises as a sign of their warike intentions just before the Java War, and Mangkubumi reported at atwwut the same time that Dipanagara was wearing his favourite kris (? Kyai see ns. 121 and 190) which he seldom carried. He also described how from time to time held it in his hand in a threatening manner (see

% an Nes, 'Verhandeling p. 156, p. 158).

°. siang para garwa-putral..../\mapan samya rèdi Silarong jinujug: according to Chevallier ('Dag-Register, 19 Jul. 1825), Payen ('Voyage', 19 Jul. 1825), and me Buku (KITLV Or. 13, IX. 48-51, pp. 95-6), Dipanagara sent his wives and children away from Tégalréja with valuables to pay for his troops to Sélarong on 18 July. Dipanagara's account (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 100-7, pp. 362-3), however. confirms the description given in this babad that the wives, children and ~ men were sent away from Tégalréja to go to Sélarong just before the Dvxtch expedition arrived there on 20 July. According to Dipanagara, Sindu=agara and Mandura arrived very shortly after this had happened (LOr 6547 >. XXI. 108 p. 364 ..../rong panginang watawis).... in the space of time it took to chew two mouthfuls of sirih later).

-~ C pan Mitragna wastanipun: Mitragna is taken from Skr. Amitraghna 'the killer of enemies'. The horses which Dipanagara mentioned in his own babad were called Kya Githayu, a large black horse with white fetlocks (LOr 6547 b, XXI.
12~-8, pp. 368-9), Kyai Girismun (LOr 6547 c, XXII. 223, p. 34) and Kyai Wijaya Tapa, a large bay horse, (LOr 6547, c, XXV. 40; Louw, II, p. 385).
According to Payen ('Voyage', 21 Jul. 1825), Dipanagara rode a fine black horse * Kyai Githayu) during his flight from Tégalréja. It was superbly harnessed and the reins were attached to Dipanagara's belt perhaps to leave both his hands free for fighting (see also n. 187 below).

173 mapan kuning padhang bulan song-songipun: there is a picture of Dipanagara with this payung (state umbrella) being held over him in the Baka (KITLV Or.
13, p. 99a). In fact as the son of an unofficial wife (selir) Dipanagara would only have been entitled to a white payang with gold bands. A yellow payung with gold bands was reserved to sons of the Sultan by official wives (garwa padmi) (see KITLV H 139. 'Namen en Eer Tituls'; Louw, vol. I, p. 498, n. 1). It is interesting that the babad writer apparently found no difficulty in reconciling santri and satria values by depicting Dipanagara in the raiments of the Holy War (see above n. 169) but with the trappings of kraton office (the payung),

thus providing an intriguing example of Javanese syncretism (see further Care: 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 50-1 and the Introduction pt. IV).

kaya putra Dwarawati: this refers to Samba, the son of Prabu Kresna in th:

wayang, whose kraton was at Dwarawati (GR, vol. I, p. 587, and see abov: n. 88).

..... Dewadenia: from the Skr. Deradatta 'the gift of the gods'. The marking: seem to refer to Kya Githayu (see above n. 172). It is worth noting that is some accounts of the Ratu Adil, the latter is supposed to make his appearance on a horse with similar markings (f#rongga jamus) (Interview with RW. Hardjanta Pradjapangarsa, Surakarta, 6 Mar. 1972).

winatara satengah pal tebihipun; In his letter to Van der Capellen on 20 Jul, Smissaert described how the expedition against Tégalréja halted 70-80 rood; (700-800 metres) outside the boundary of Dipanagara's dalém. A Javanese.
Mas Nitirantia, was then sent ahead to assure the people at Té&galréja that the force had no hostile intentions and that if Dipanagara and Mangkubumi came out unarmed, Chevallier would be prepared to negotiate with them. Instead Nitirantia was mishandled and people poured out of the surrounding villages firing shots and throwing stones (MvK 'Bylage Smissaert no. 12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 402).

..... nguman-uman nudingi: it is a very considerable breach of Javanese euquette to point with one's finger and it is never done at another person. The

babad wrirer undoubtedly inserted the gesture here to stress Wiranagara's anger.

178 dumeb bebet Surapati: this refers to Wiranagara's relationship through his

mother to the famous Balinese adventurer of the late seventeenth century, Untung Surapati (see SB 144, LXI. 22-6, p. 367; and De Klerck, vol. VI, p.
250 which discuss his ancestry). Surapati was especially renowned for his destruction of the Dutch garrison at Kartasura (1686). He later set up a personal kraton in che neighbourhood of Pasuruhan and ruled as an independent prince with the title of Pangeran Aria Wiranagara. His influence stretched over much of East Java by the time of his deach in 1706 and he had a numerous progeny whom he warned never to make their peace with the Dutch, see Ann Kumar.

Wiranagara's ancestry related him to Pauh Danuréja IV, who was likewise of Balinese descent from Surapati, and he also possessed a kris, Kyai Gadhung, which was once a of Surapati. Although he was married to a daughter of Pangeran Abubakar, who was one of the first Yogya princes to go over to Dipanagara together with Wiranagara's son (see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 405), Wiranagara himself remained loyal to the Dutch throughout the Java War.
Nevertheless, his allegiance was called into question by De Salis (see above n.
156) and he received various letters urging him to join Dipanagara at S&larong (Chevallier, 'Dag-Register', 26 Jul. 1825, KITLV H 699, nos. 26 & 28, P.
Suryengalaga to Major Tumenggung Wiranagara, Jul. 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 16 Sept. 1825 and Louw, vol. I, p. 285; p. 403). He was appointed as an independent prince with the title of P. Adipati Prabuningrat after the war, but was exiled to Banda for suspected intrigues against the Dutch government on 5 Aug. 1832, when his relationship with Surapat was used as evidence against him (see Sartono Kartodirdjo (ed.), Laporan Politik tahun 1837, (Djakarta, 1971), p. 57, n. 16; AN BCG, 20 Sept. 1832 no. 1, and SB 144, LXI 1-28, pp. 364- 7). The remark made here in this babad serves to underline the very real tensions in the Yogya kraton at this time between the clique around Danuréja who profited from their associations with the Dutch and the officials who joined Dipanagara (see above n. 119 and below n. 180).

Babad Dipanagara

,- - Scar Jawi ...... this refers to the Outer Bupati, R.T. Ranadiningrat, ear.=* =-- vommander of the Wirabraja and Jagakarya regiments (SB 135, LXXXr 336). A second expedition against Tegalreja is not mentioned in the sources and it is possible that the babad writer confused it with the -z3= sent against SClarong on 24 July, which went as far as Bantul and on s=.:= surakarta troops (a detachment of the Mangkun@garan Legion) took part «-==sallier, 'Dag-Register', 24 Jul. 1825 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 259).
was not wounded in the fighting at Tégalr&ja see below IX. 28, * :n a small skirmish in Yogya on 5 Aug. ('Dag-Register', 5 Aug. 1825; SB <- L 35-6, p. 215 and see Introduction pt. II). The babad writer may have aearc sbout the skirmish and Ranadiningrar's wound from the Surakarta troops

=. served in Yogya at this time.

 ns Sang Arya Sangkuni: this refers to Patih Aria Sangkuni, the devious a~m:iser of the Kurawa faction in the Mahabharata cycle of wayang kulit plays.
Ts forms part of the wayang purwa or 'original! wayang plays, which dramatzr episodes in the lives of Java's oldest mythological hgures, especially the of the final cycle, the five Pandhawa brothers (Brandon, On Thrones of +4. p. 2). Sangkuni is renowned as a clever talker but not an honest man, and : person of this character has always been proverbially called a 'Sangkuni' in java (Hardjowirogo, Sedjarah Wajang Purwa, pp. 202-3). It would, indeed, =sve been an apt description for Wiranagara who played a double game with '=e Dutch, despising them at the same time as using them for self-advancement se+ further De Klerck, vol. VI, pp. 247-52). It is also interesting to note how ° tar images from the wayang theatre are important as illustrations in this babad, which reflects on the great contemporary interest in wayang forms at the Surakarta court at the time (see Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 7-11; pp. 47 54: Hageman, Gescheidenis, p. 24; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving' p. 41 and the Introduction pr. IV).

* ngaler-ngilen Pakuncen jinujug: Pasar Kuncen is due west of the Yogya kraton just over the Kali Winonga (see Louw, vol. I, Map 3). There was a sirect road from Kuncen to Tompeyan, the village near T&galreja (see above n.
42) and south to Sélarong (see SB 136, XXXVIII 50-52, p. 161). If Ranadiningrat and Wiranagara had met up with Chevallier, who was halted before Tégalréja, they would have had to turn around S.E. to go to Kuncen, unless the babad writer is here referring to the departure from Yogya. It is possible that since this account was written by a Surakarta pujangga, the author was unfamiliar with the local geography around Yogya.

I 1 b

? ..... bendhe tinitir ungungkung. the bendhe is a type of cymbal which is sounded as a war alarm to gather people for battle (GR, vol. II, p. 654 and on the sounding of bìndhes and drums in engagements with Dipanagara's troops see Louw, vol. III, p. 71).

(3 prajurit jro patang tambur ..... this refers to the four brigades of the Sultan's bodyguard each led by a drummer (tambur) which deserted to Dipanagara with Surabraja: the Jaga-upa, Mandrapratama, Katanggung and Brajataka (see above VIII. 10-11).

:83a kadya Badyo angèjawi: the term Badyo (Bajo) refers the state of Wajo in southern Sulawesi which was renowned for its seafaring people, some of whom engaged in piracy, see Chr. Pelras, 'Notes sur quelques populations aquatiques de I' Archipel nusantarien' Archipe/ 3 (1972), pp. 133-69.

184 Mantri Jro Surabraja:; see above n. 163. This either refers to Surabraja's position as a Mantri of the kraton or to the Mantri Jéro corps which was later

reconstituted under Dipanagara (see above n. 116).

Historical Notes & Commentary

185 mariyime pinasang: according to Smissaert, the affray which started afte: Niuranua's mission (see above n. 176) soon developed into a full scale battle The Dutch troops deployed into the seuwbs (ricehelds) surrounding Tégalré:s in an attempt to encircle Dipanagara's residence. The ricehelds were, however.
very muddy because of the constant rain, unusual at chat time of the year, anc a cavalry charge which was made to secure the persons of Dipanagara anc Mangkubumi failed. Finally, the cavalry were withdrawn by Chevallier and the two cannon fired at the village people which killed about 15-20 men. The decision was then taken to return to Yogya (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no.
12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype .

pp. 402-3 and Payen, 'Voyage', 17 Jul. 1825; 20 Jul. 1825 who also mentoned the heavy rain).

185a ingsun kon aprang sabilimamangun agamaling Kangjing Rasulullah: see above n. 30.

186 medal pungkuran: this is confrmed by Dipanagara in his babad in which he described how Mangkubumi and himself fled by a gateway in the western wall of the dam of Tégalréja, They were then able to break through the Dutch lines by riding over the paths in the sawahs (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 126, p. 369 and see MvK 4194, Mangkubumi to Paku Alam, n.d. and Van der Kemp.
'Hamlettype', p. 332). This gateway in the western wall of Dipanagara's estate was clearly visible when Brumund visited Tegalreja in the 1840's ('Bezoek', pp.
192-3) and an opening in the old wall can still be seen today (1972).

187 gong maguru gongsa: this refers to the gongs in the Javanese orchestra, the gamelan. Dipanagara in his babad used an almost similar metaphor to describe the darting hooves of his horse Kyai Githayu (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 137, p. 371 ..... Githayu eca nyirig 138. Langknng bigar mapan anglir tinabubanl.....) and Payen ('Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825) noted that during the flight from Tegalr&ja, Dipanagara made his horse prance as though he was dancing on it (.. i/ piaffer son cheval, les reins attachés à sa ceinture. 11 tandagua an milieu de ces officiers armks de lances). The description probably derives from the fact that the gamilan was often played during jousting contests (§S¥neran and Sttonan) on the alun-alun when the riders rode in time to the music (see Djajadiningrat,

Herinneringen. p. 11). On the use of gongs and gamélans to rally DN's forces in battle, see Louw, vol. I, p. 549; vol. II, p. 528.

188 Pangeran sidya ing wuksriSilarong ...... in his babad, Dipanagara related how the decision to go to Sëlarong was only taken after he and Mangkubumi had watched T&galreja burn (see below n. 198). They then crossed the Kali Bayem with the remainder of their followers and observed the evening prayer (mabrib). Because of their fatigue they slept at Semampir, a village to the north of the road from Yogya to Séntolo (see De Klerck, vol. V, Map). The next day

they continued south to the Kali Soka where they met the women and children who had been summoned from Sélarong. Eventually they moved to S&larong

with them (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 147 - XXII. 10, pp. 373-376). The Yogya babad and the B#k# in general confirm Dipanagara's account, but add the detail that they wont N.W. to Tangkilan where they arrived in the evening. They were all very hungry so they plundered the stores and houses of the Chinese in Bulu and Tangkilan and burnt them to the ground (this would fir with the antiChinese sentiments aroused at the beginning of the war, see above n. 106, but may be a detail added by a hostile witness). Afterwards they slept at Polaman and went to Selarong the following day (21 Jul. 1825) (SB 136. L. 1 -3, pp. 211-2: KITLV Or. 13, X. 1-4, p. 103). Danureéja's spy. Ng. Mertadiwirya. also corroborated the story (see below n. 197).

Babad Dipanagara

t- luisa gélare sitih santosa: emprit neba refers to a Javanese battle formation : -> which means lit. 'small birds rising. This is the formation when one or s - :..ked men come forward first from the main body and fall on the enemy vol. I, p. 169). In fact, apart from the attempt by the Dutch hussars to .- Mangkubumi and Dipanagara off after their flight from Tegalreja (see . .- n 186). there is no mention in any other account that there was a con--: attempt to intercept Dipanagara's retreat to Sélarong.

K mesrang suduk wasiyat saking kang rama/KalngYyeng Sultan ping katri: this was e zablyv Kyai Abijaya, a pwsaka kris which Dipanagara had inherited from his 'see above ns. 121 & 169) and which was later meked down with other -s, belonging to DN to make his kris Kyai Ageng Bandayuda. Knoerle --terred to DN's kris as follows ('Journal', p.31) *.... Dipanagara placed a *<itiful, expensive kris in my hands (and) spoke the following words: "See sere an heirloom of my father, who is now a friend of God, this krss is a ?3 sky (heirloom) of many years. When my father wished to give a token of omission to the Marshal (Daendels) he gave this selfsame kris into his hands.
But the Marshal gave it back for he knew it to be a holy pusaka and that my was a true friend of the Dutch. Dipanagara also had in his possession a sa>re. possibly of English origin (? from HB III), which was captured by the

-rich in 1829 and presented to De Kock (see dK 56, Col. J. Ledel to De Kock, 28 Jun. 1829).

z-spreng Winongia): the river Winonga runs just to the west of Yogya in a N-S rection. At this time there was a ford across the river further to the south on the road to Sanasewu opposite the kraton. This was probably Wiranagara's »iective (see Louw, vol. 1, Map 3).

11 uarcke sungsun atindhik: the numbers killed in the battle around Tegalreja are rather uncertain. Smissaert mentioned that a Sergeant (wachtmeester) of the Sultan's Dutch dragoon bodyguard, David (? an Ambonese), was killed in the cavalry charge and three others of the same corps wounded by pikes (MvK 1132. 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 12, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 20 Jul. 1825 and see also Payen, 'Voyage', 20 Jul. 1825 and above n. 185). Dipanagara specifically mentioned the death of one hussar (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 143-5, pp.

3~3-3) and reckoned that 80 other Dutchmen were killed (Ibid, XXII. 2, p.
374), but his figures for battle losses were never very accurate. Dutch sources

state that about 15-20 of DN's forces perished, see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 403.

-~ uontén Mayor Mondrapratama raniralRaden Jayapramadi: this seems to refer to the eldest son of Danurtja II (1799-1811) by an unofficial wife, Mas Ayu

Pulungayun. Together with his younger brother, R. Bagus Sukapja, he served in the Yogya kraton as a panakawan from 1819, and, on the accession of HB

V (Dec. 1822) he became an abdi-daléim (Lurah Pranakan) with the title of Raden Lurah Jayapermadi (for full family details see LOr 11089 (1) 'Lélampahanipoen Kangdjeng Pangeran Arja Djoeroe saking R.M.P. Santadilaga', Lempoejangan, (Djokjokarta) (1929). If he had served in the Sultan's bodyguard he would probably have been a member of the Jaga-upa corps which was composed of panakawans (see above n. 44). There is evidence that he did not go

over to Dipanagara until early in August 1825 when he left the kraton with his younger brother and Raden Bagus Sentot, all three kraton panakawans and

close friends (see LOr 11089 (1) pp. 4-5; SB 136, LV 15, LVI. 3, pp. 242-9; Dj. Br. 45, Smissaert to P. le Clercq (Res. of Kédhu), 6 Aug. 1825; Idem., Smissaert to De Kock, 9 Aug. 1825). Later all three became important armycommanders of Dipanagara: Jayapermadi as Basah Ngabdulkamil Mertanagara (he was also a son-in-law of Dipanagara), Sukapja as Basah Ngadul Mahmud Gandakusuma (see above the introduction pt. V.C) and SZ&ntot as Ali Basah

Historical Notes & Commentary

Abdul Mustapa Prawiradirja. The latter was related to Dipanagara by mar: ..
(see LOr 6547 d, XXXII. 21, p. 4). The babad writer has thus used Jaya; madi's name in an incident in which he could not have taken part, although tr.. is a possibility that another Yogya officer is intended here (see BL Add. ~

route they took was not the direct one to Bantul, but one across the back .
the limestone hills behind Sélarong (see Map A).

196 Ngambarkatawang ...... see above ns. 21 & 42. Ambarkatawang is on the row:

which runs SW. from Yogya to Sentolo. The scouts would have had to tur: back to Kuncen to get on the road which led south to Pendhawi and Selarore (SB 136, XXXVIII. 50-2, p. 161 and see above n. 181).

197 desa ing Baniul .....: Bantul is now a kabupaten capital to the south of Yogya.

but it was then probably still a small village. A small side road leads west across the sawak: from the outskirts of Bantul to S&larong (visit to Selarong, Dec

1971; Louw, vol. I, Map 8, 'Situatie-Schets van S&larong en Omstreken'). Az.
official of Danur&ja, Ngabehi Me&rtadiwirya from the village of Kemusuh to the west of Yogya, possibly the «pa: (courier) referred to in this babad, reportes that Dipanagara and Mangkubumi had been seen after their flight from Tégalreja. They had passed through the village of Ngrajek near Melangi and ai ~ p.m. they had halted ar Gancahan a village to the west of Tangkilan (see above n. 188). The following morning they arrived at the dese of Mutian (Kembang Putian/Sélarong) at 8 a.m. There, he described them, as gathering their followers and at the same time a residence was being prepared for them at Jélégong.
just to the cast of the Praga river in the house of the Mantri ima buru (head of the tiger hunters) (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', no. 10, Report of Ng. Mertadiwirya, ? 22 Jul. 1825 and on the apanage areas of the Jélégong tiger hunters see BL Add. 12342, f. 274r.). In his report to Van der Capellen on 20 July, Smissaert mentioned that Mangkubumi and Dipanagara were at the desa of Sécang near the Sultan's pesanggrahan of Toya Temumpang and on 29 July he wrote that the princes were forming a 'kraton' at S&larong (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825). In his babad Dipanagara stated chat he stayed at the house of Kyai D&Emang Arjabaya at SElarong (see LOr 6547 b, XXII. 13. p. 377, Louw, vol. I, p. 262, p. 437 n. 3) and see below n. 208.

198 datan ana kang kari las sudaya. the Dutch reports omit all mention of the

plundering of Tégalréja, but it is confirmed in the babads (SB 136, L. 1, p.
211; KITLV Or. 13, X. 2, p. 103). Dipanagara added the detail that it was burnt to the ground (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 147-8, p. 373). Most of Dipanagara's possessions were carried off to Yogya by Danuréja's men including the prince's large gamélan orchestra. Indeed, in a later conversation, Dipanagara remarked that he had been forced to leave his Ze/lém in such haste that 3,000 guilders in ready money, and much pads from the Puasa taxes of that year had been left behind (Knoerle, 'Journal'; p. 4; De Klerck, vol. V. Bijlage XXXVI, p. 743).
Some belongings and valuables had, however, been sent ahead with the women and children to S&élarong (see above n. 170). The fact that Tégalréja was gutted was corroborated later by Brumund ('Bezoek', p. 185 and see further Louw, vol. I, Bijlage LVII, p. 731, Mangkubumi & Dipanagara to De Kock, 23 Aug.
1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamletrtype', pp. 332-3).

Babad Dipanagara

=. .srenya nglit klantaka wrtsacanthuka: there seems to be a mixed metaphor ~-re kalantaka refers to a small cannon, about a half pounder, which was cast -. the Javanese themselves (GR, vol. I, p. 485; Raffles, HJ, vol. I, p. 296), aAcreas wréeacanthuka seems to suggest sasracanthukawarsa: -a hubbub (lit.
the croaking of a thousand frogs in rain').

» Raden Tumönggung Danunagara: a Yogya Nayaka (Bupati jabay, like Sin:unagara, he was a relation of Danuréja II. Crawfurd described him as 'a man _? very little talent (NvB Port. S, pt. 5, Crawfurd to Nahuys van Burgst, 9 Aug. 1816).

-+ *1 santana samya nangkil: on 21 July Chevallier noted in his diary ('DagRegister) that the princes and Bupatis had come together to nominate a new for the Sultan. P. Adinagara was named, but he went over to

Dipanagara during the night with his younger brother P. Suryadipura (see above ns. 113 & 129).

a Kangjëng Pangran Pakualamlgumrëdèg wadya kang fring: according to Mang: xubumi's testimony Paku Alarg's Legion had been mobilised as carly as the morning of 20 July when he was summoned to the fort at 4 a.m. to take the message to Dipanagara (LOr 6547 b, XXI. 89, p. 359; MvK 4194, GKA 13 Mar. 1827, Litt. 31, no. 34, Anon. to HB II, n.d., and see above n. 117).

< ! pnsliyun enggal-enggalanimring Surakarta Betawi: Smissaert dispatched two letters to Van der Capellen: the first on 19 July warning him of Dipanagara's preparations and the second, on 20 July, relating the events of the attack on Tégalréja (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 19 Jul. & 20 Jul. 1825 and see Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 383 n. 1, pp.
402-4). The latter was sent first to Surakarta to inform MacGillavry of events in Yogya (NvB Port. 9, pt. 2, MacGillavry to Smissaert, 20 Jul. 1825) who relayed it to Batavia via SEmarang where it was received by the AssistantResident, J.A.R. Caspersz, on 22 July (see below n. 245). MacGillavry also seems to have sent a covering letter relating how Dipanagara had been mobilising troops in a desa near Sala, but that the Surakarta court had so far remained loyal and that detachments of the Sunan's prajerits and the Mangkunegaran Legion had been sent to Yogya (Anon., 'Aanteckeningen van den Gouverneur-General Baron van der Capellen over den Opstand van Dipo Negoro in 1825, TNI, no. 2 (1860), pp. 363-4). Van der Capellen received the letters on 24 July, in his description 'completely unexpectedly' (op her aller onverwachts), and on 26 July the decision was taken to send the LieutenantGovernor, General H.M. de Kock, to Central Java with full military and civilian powers (MvK 2789, BGG ir, 26 Jul. 1825, no. 1; Louw, vol. 1, p. 253).
The way the news is related as having been transmitted in this babad is therefore substantially correct except for a few minor details. The use of estafettes (fast mounted couriers) at this time is mentioned in Van der Kemp, 'Brieven'

(1896), p. 542 and see also Jar. Coxr. no. 138, 18 Nov. 1828.

2102 wisma dhusun ing Bendha Wiryawijaya: see above n. 123. In his letter to the king in Sept 1828 (vAE no. 28) Smissaert mentioned that he was told by Danuréja on the morning of 20 July that Dipanagara stood in close contact with Kramadiwirya from Kedhu and the inhabitants of the desa of Bendha. He added that the latter were renowned for their rebellious spirit, and that when DN's enterprise in Yogya proved successful they would fall on Magelang.

203 ing Demak lan Sémarangi.... Jing Rawa Kalangbret padha: SEmarang and Démak were both government controlled kabupaten on the north coast which were the scene of bitter fighting during the first months of the war (see Louw, vol. I, pp.

361-93 and pp. 527-36). Serang was a small enclave between Gagatan and

283

Historical Notes & Commentary

Grobogan, which was administered as a hef of the Serang family (see below 205) (Dj. Br. 27, Map of Daendels' annexations in Jan. 1811). Magetan, K<tasana, Rawa and Kalangbret were all Yogya manranagara provinces to the ci» of Mt. Lawu. Madiun was the seat of the Yogyakarta Bupati: wedana before :>: Java War (see Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p. 589; NvB Port. 22, pt. 4 'Mon negorosche Djocjakartasche Landen', 1822; De Klerck, vol. VI, Map).

204 anjaganana Walondal.....!kang teka ing Semarang: Semarang and Surdbaya werthe military headquarters for the second and third military divisions (groesr militaire afdeelingen) in Java. About 1,468 troops were stationed at Semarang and Sérondol and another 930 ar Surabaya. But the garnsons were not up tc strength because of the dispatch of troops from Java to take part in the Duct military expedition against the kingdom of Bone in South Sulawesi (Jan.- Mas 1825) (on this see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 553). Instead, the Dutch had to rely on volunteer corps (schwsterij) recruited from government officials and agents of commercial and shipping houses (see Louw, 1, p. 540 ff.; p. 584.
pp. 664-5; Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 554-9; Aukes, Legroen, p. 65

On the summoning of reinforcements from Surabaya in the early months of the war see Louw, vol. I, p. 278.

205 kang bawah lor si paman Pangeran Serang: Serang was not an uncle of Dipanagara, but a relation by marriage: Serang's sister had married P. Mangkudiningrat I (see above n. 124). He was about 31 years of age in 1825 and was held in high esteem in Yogya as a descendant of Sunan Kalijaga. His mother, R. Ayu Serang, was regarded as especially s#étr (spiritually powerful) and during the war she often meditated in a cave at Trisik on the south coast (KITLV H 263, Portier, "Verklaring, p. 14). She also served as a cavalry commander, taking part in the fighting in Grobogan and Démak in Sept. 1825 (Dj. Br. 7, 'L.A.
582: Brieven 1825, Capt. H.F. Buschkens to Maj-Gen. J. van Geen, 3 Sept.
1825 and for a recent literary biography, see Mashoed Haka, Dansa Ny: Ageng Serang (Jakarta, 1976). The area of Serang had been given to Kalijaga and his descendants, who took the titles of Raden and Pangeran even though many worked as farmers and labourers (Louw, vol. 1, p. 361). De Kock later characterised Serang as a thoroughly evil man, devoid of any principles and addicted to opium (dK no. 111, 'Over het karakter van den Soesoehoenan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de prinsen en rijksgrooten', 20 Dec. 1829). In his babad Dipanagara confirmed the appointment of Serang as commander in the pasisir whilst he was at Selarong (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 52. p. 387). He carried out a very effective campaign in the north coast areas and in Sokawati, where he wielded much influence in the first years of the war, but he later gave himself up on 21 June 1827. According to Louw, vol. I, p. 362, Serang joined DN on the repeated urgings of his nephew, P. Natapraja.

206 Kertadirja kang wawangi: Mas. T. Kertadirja was well known to Dipanagara because his father had served as head of the kadipaten when Dipanagara's father was still Crown Prince (see LOr 6547 b, XV. 39-41, pp. 141-2) and he himself had been supported by Dipanagara after his unfair dismissal as Bupati of Kerja (in the Karangpandhan area of Sokawati) in Dec. 1821. This dismissal had been engincered by the Yogya Patih, Danurgja IV, who appointed his wife's uncle, R.T. Sasrawirana, to replace him (see SB 136 (Babad Ngayogya, vol. II) XXXVIII, 20-25, pp. 157-8). Mangkunegara II had also pressed for Ke&rtadirja's dismissal because he coveted the Kìrja area which adjoined his own lands in Karangpandhan. Kertadirja was thus a good example of a Bupati dhongkol, one of the many prematurely dismissed Bupatis, who rallied to Dipanagara at this time (see above n. 39). In his babad Dipanagara confirmed that he gave Körtadirja his command in Sokawati at the same time as Serang received his authority in the pesisir (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 52, p. 387). Both Serang and Kertadirja were active around Madiun, but the latter was captured

. ° _ Pangran Mangkuntbgaral.....!lan asaguh ngrusak gunung Karangpandhan: this refers to K.G.P. A.A. Mangkunégara II (1796-1835) who was a good friend of the Dutch and a proponent of estate management in Central Java. Karangpandhan, to the east of Sala in the foothills of Mt. Lawu, was, according to Willem van Hogendorp, one of the best maintained teak forests in Java at chat ume {H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp in Nederlandsch-lndië, 1825-1830, p. 167). The area also contained the graves of the Mangkunegaran tamily at Girilayu and Méngad@g. It was overrun by Dipanagara's followers in Aug. 1826. After the war the 500 karyas of Yogya land at Kerja in the Sokawati area were given to the Mangkunégaran as a token of Dutch gratitude for the help they had received from the court during the war (Rouffaer, 'Vorstenlanden', p. 603, MacGillavry to P. Merkus, 16 Feb. 1832, loc. cit.; A.P.
Buchler, 'Soerakarta vóór 63 jaren', TNI (1888) vol. II, p. 8).

W Frat plagem pangwasa: a piagèm is a letter of appointment or authority. The only original piag?m of Dipanagara still extant is that appointing Amad-dafém keeper of the royal graves) Ripangi, Bupat of Kutha GE&dhe in Mar. 1826 which is written in begon script with Dipanagara's pegon seal in the top right hand corner (dK no. 127, Sultan Abdul Hamid Erucakra to Amad-dalém Rifai (Ripangi), 16 Shaban, Wawu, A.H. 1241 (26 Mar. 1826). Some copies of the piagéms sent out by Dipanagara and Mangkubumi at the beginning of the war to their supporters are, however, still extant (see above n. 122), and the distribution of commands and pisgéms is confirmed by Dipanagara and the Dutch reports (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 39-58, pp. 383-8; Dj. Br. 54. Smissaert to commander of Klathen, 3 Aug. 1825, where he mentioned that DN was giving out titles and payangs at SEélarong; dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825, described how the princes and Bupatis were lodged at the house of the Demang (of Kémbang Putian), Kyai Demang Arjabaya, with only 150-200 armed men as a guard and that bands of people came daily from the surrounding areas and departed the same day after they had received their orders, see further Louw, vol. I, p. 262, p. 400).

V ginadbuhan songsong jenar/pratandbhanira prang sabil: see above n. 173. The distribution of peyungs (state umbrellas) was not so much the sign of the Holy War as a regalia of office. Hence in his babad (LOr 6547 b, XXII. 39, p. 383), Dipanagara described how yellow payungs were distributed to Mangkuwijaya

and Mangkudirja after they had been promoted as Pangerans see below n.
215). RM. Soewongso was also offered a white payung if he agreed to join

Dipanagara (dK no. 183, 'Verklaring van Raden Mas Soewongso', 7 Aug. 1825) and payangs were carried by commanders in battle: thus during the siege of Magelang, the Resident of Kédhu noticed red and yellow payangs amongst the troops besieging the town (dK no. 182, P. le Clercq to De Kock, 29 Jul. 1825) and they were larer carried by DN's troops fighting in Bagtlen (Bat. Cour, no.
107, 8 Nov. 1827). See Louw, vol. 1, p. 498 for a description of the payangs.

209 Jeng Pangeran nimbali Pangeran Seranglpeparah Sumawijaya: The Dutch sources do not confirm that Serang went in person to Sélarong to receive his commands from P. Dipanagara. Instead he seems to have sent a kinsman, R. Topeng (R.

Wangsadiwirya), to receive them for him (see dK 180, H.J. Domis to Van der Capellen, 23 Sept. 1825; Id. to Id., 25 Sept. 1825).

212 ..... Tumenggung Samadigdaya: a certain R. Ng. Sumadigdaya, a son of R.T.
Sumadiningrat (killed 1812), is mentioned in the Dutch reports as a gung from Yogya who joined Dipanagara (dK no. 198, 'Lyst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen', no. 76, and see further KITLV H 76 pt. 2). He was later appointed by DN as R.T. Sumadiningrat II (see Jar. Conr. no. 123, 14 Oct. 1828).

213 kang rama nyatunran naemulPanembahan Alangkubumi, $missaert mentioned on 29 July that Mangkubumi had becn appointew a Pertmbahan. But in his babad Dipanagara described how Mangkubumi was given the new name and title of Panembahan Ngabdulraup only after he himself had been appointed as Sultan on 15 Aug. 1825 (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaere to MacG:llavry, 29 Jul. 1825; LOr 6547 c, XXII. 52, pp. 8-9). Despite his high ide Mangkubumi's task throughout the war was to look after the women and children (dK no. 158.
'Lyst der Personen' no. 2). Dipanagara charactcrised him as a coward tingkang knwatos kemawon) (Knuerie, 'Journal, p. 15), and Brumund (Bezoek, p. 192) aptly referred to him as Dipanagara's 'Great eunuch. For a more generous appraisal of Mangkubumi's character see De Salis (MvK 4207, 'Pro Memorie, 8 May 1828) who referred to him as 'a quiet, soft and gende man'. On Mang kubumi's activities during the war see further dK 111, Over het karakter van den Socsochoecnan, den Sultan van Djokjokarta en de prinsen en rijksgrooten', Magelang, 10 Dec. 1829 and Jar.

214 nama Paugeran AdipatiiSuryenglaga Senapati Subilullah: Dipanagara described how Adinagara was given the title of P. Suryenglaga and served as his temporary Pauh (ngir Pepatihe) after be had defected to Sélarong with the Mandhung and Patangpuluh regiments on 21 July (LQOr 654° b, XXI. 13-14, p.
377; Makasar MS. Book 11, p. 6 and see above n. 113). Smissaert reported chat he was given the title of Pangeran Adipatt Anom Surya Ingalaga Sempati neng prang (tbe Commander in Baule) on 2 Aug. (Dj. Br. 94. Smussacrt circular letrer to Residents in Java, ? Aug. 1825 and see Payen, Voyage. 159 Aug.
1825). He was extremely active in raising forces for Dipanagara to the south of Yogya around Krapyak in the carly days of the war (dK no. 197, Smissaert to De Kock, 30 Jul. 1825 and see further Louw, vol. 1, p. 262; p. 432 ff. and p.
434 n. 1).

According to Dipanagara, he appointed Papak as P. Natapraja at Selarong and gave him the right to carry a yellow payung (LÖr 6547 b. XXII. 39, pp. 383 4).

216 Ruden Suryakusuma wusliininingaktun Paugran: Suryakusuma was a son of P.

- nama PangmbabaniTuwan sek Ngabdul;hamid: the babad writer's »..ount of the names given to the rebel leaders seems to have been based on 'he rather garbled reports reaching Yogya at this time. Thus on 13 Aug. Smissuert reported that Dipanagara was styling himself as 'Pungeran Panatagama' or \wuhaunan Ingalaga Panatazgama (dK no. 181, Smissaert to De Kock, 13 Aug.
IX35; dK no. 180, Domis to Alg. Secr., 26 Jul. 1825). it was not until 15 Aug.

The full titles were apparently first divulged to Dipanagara in his vision of the eight wel « imthars on 27 Puasa, A.J. 1752, (16 May 1825) see LOr 6547 b, XX. 51-7, pp.
>2~-9. The fact that the babad writer did not know of Dipanagara's full title and the use of the name Ergeakra is probably because this fragment was completed before 15 Aug. 1825. See further Louw, vol. 11, p. 569 who quoted a letter of * Van Pabst to De Kock (3 Nov. 1826) stating that DN was recognised as Sultan in all the Yogyakarta mawncanagare provinces which rebelled in 1825.

In his babad Dipanagara described how Adiwinara was given a command in Kédhu under the guardianship of Kyai T. Mangund:pura, an ex-Bupati uedana of Kedhu, (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 44, p. 385; SB 136, LIl. 22, p. 228). Adikusuma was a son of HB I and in all other accounts he is mentioned as having remained loyal to the Dutch (see dK 158, 'Naamlijst der

197). Thus the B&kx describes how foodstuffs became very expensive in Yogya:

because small traders were prevented from coming to sell their wares there KITLV Or. 13 XII (Asmaradana) p. 124:

rejeki langkung awise

sabab dene pinépetan bakul malébeng praja

The Baku s account is confirmed in Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen' p. 71. According to Smissaert, on 23 August the price of a préx/ (62.5 kgs.) of rice rose to the astonishing figure of 60 silver guilders (Dj. Br. 54. Smissaert to Res. of Kedhu, 23 Aug. 1825 and this is partly confirmed by Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 71, who noted that a measure of rice, which outside Yogyakarta cost 50 duits (62.50 cents), sold for 25 silver guilders (peraks) inside the town). All the main articles of food (rice, oil, salt and fodder) were lacking and horses were slaughtered and even ricizws (castor-oil plants) and the trunks of banana trees were eaten (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to Res. of KEdhu, 1 Aug: 18295; Smissaert circular letter, 2 Aug. 1825; Id. to MacGillavry, 3 Aug. 1825; Id. to De Kock 11 Aug. 185; KITLV Or. 13, X. 5i-2, pp. 116-7). At the same ume, Dipanagara's forces cut off the fresh water supply to the fort, the Residency, the kraton and the Mesjid Ageng, see Louw, vol. 1, p. 301; Payen, 'Voyage', 6 Sept. 1825. The local Javanese also seem to have boycotted Dutch money, one

silver guilder only fetching 2 cents (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 3 Aug. 1825). The only store of food within the city seems to have been a

warehouse of rice owned by Smissaert. This was used by him somewhat reluctantly during the last weeks of the siege in Sept. 1825 to feed the officers and troops in Yogya (see Louw, vol. I, p. 277 n. and vAE, Smissaert to King William 1, n.d. (? Sept. 1828); Payen, 'Voyage', 4 Sept. 1825). Later, when Willem van Hogendorp visited Yogya in 1827, he described how thousands of coconut trees had had their tops cur off to be eaten as food and how a handful of rice had been sold for a guilder (H. Graaf van Hogendorp, Willem van Hogendorp, p. 174). Even as late as September 1825, after the town had been relieved, some inhabitants were stull dying of hunger (MvK 4132 'Bylage Smissaert', Smissaert to De Kock, 12 Sept. 1825; Payen, 'Voyage', 2 Sept. 1825; Louw, I, pp.
354-8.) Many peopïz fled from Yogya to Kutha G&dhe which became the main market in the Yogya area (KITLV Or. 13, X. 47-8, pp. 115-6, XII. 3, p. 124). LL. Portier reported how four Bupaus loyal to Dipanagara at Kucha Gédhe had prevented supplies from reaching Yogya (KITLV H. 263, Portier, 'Verklaring', p. 18). All those with rice to sell either gathered there or left for the villages (KITLV Or. 13, X. 52, p. 117 and Louw, vol. I, p. 289; p. 355).
Sëlarong also became an important market centre for the region and when Maj.-Gen. J. van Geen eventually captured the place in October 1825 he confirmed that Dipanagara had set up a market there during his stay. (LOr

6547 b, XXII. 35-6, pp. 382-3; dK no. 197, J. van Geen to H.M. de Kock, 1 Oct. 1825, and see above n. 29).

ing Bulus Suradilagal/Bupati salor nagari: Suradilaga's appomtment as a Bupati and a commander to the north of Yogya is confirmed in the babads and in the Durch reports (dK no. 158, 'Lyst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen', no. 29; Louw, vol. 1, Bijlage LVIII, p. 732; SB 136, LIV. 21, p. 238, LOr 6547 b, XXII. 47-8, pp. 385-6). In the latter account he is mentioned as the guardian @mbanr) of P. Jayakusuma (later P. Ngabehi). Bulus is a

village on the slopes of Mt. Mérapi just above Candhi on the Kali Codhe (see De Klerck, vol. IV, Map and Dumont, Woordenboek, p. 85).

rwice (see above ns. 123 & 202). R.T. Natayuda was a Yogya Bupati who came over to Dipanagara at Selarong and was made a commander in L&dhok, Gowong and KEedhu (LOr 6547 b, XXII, 26, p. 380. XXII. 44, p. 385; dK no. 158, 'Lyst der Personen welke zich als muitelingen hebben opgeworpen', no. 55; Javadiningrar, 'Schetsen', p. 56; SB 136, LVI. 12, p. 250). He was the son of R.T. Natayuda 1. the Bupati Wedana of Kedhu and brother-in-law of Natakusuma, who was poisoned in 1804 (see Poensen, 'Amdngku Buwana II.
p. 117). Family grievances and the loss of administrative position were probably two of the factors which persuaded him to join Dipanagara in 1825.

Bupati kidul nagari/Dyan Tuménggung Amangkuyuda ...... Mangkuyuda is referred to in the Yogya babad as Kyai Mangkuyuda, Lurah penongsong (chief of the payung carriers) in the Yogya kraton who went over to Dipanagara at Sélarong (SB 136, XLVIII. 33, p. 202). He was later given command of 1,000 prayur:::

by Dipanagara when the latter was at Jum@énéng (Kulon Praga) and served to the south of Yogya (LOr 6547 c, XXIV. 32, p. 45).

Taminggung Kértapanawangling Plantaran desa saler négari: there is a reference to a certain Tuméenggung Jayapenawang in the Buéz who operated to the north of Yogya around Pisangan and Gawok (KITLV Or. 13 X. 26, p. 110; XXI. 16, p. 127; LOr 2163, XIV. 6, p. 162). Other sources refer to a certain Tumé&nggung Urawan, earlier Démang of Plantaran, who was also known as Yudapenawang Adimustapa and Haji Abdulkadir (see Jayadiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 101 and Jar. Cowr. no. 148, 11 Dec. 1828). DN made him commander of the Bulkio regiment (see LOr 6547 b, XXII. 97, p. 398). Plantaran may refer to Pisangan or to Plemburan, a village three miles to the north of Yogya (IOR X. IX. 3, Topographische Kaart der Res. Djokjakarta' (1861), and there are also villages by the name of Plumbangan and in S. Kedhu (see IOR X.
IX. 4, 'Topographische Kaart der Res. Kadoe' (1880).

Martadiwirya T uminggung/Kimusuh desanira: this appears to refer to Ng. Mértadiwirya, an official of Danuréja from the village of Kemusuh to the west of Yogya who made a report on Dipanagara's movements after his flight from Tégalréja (SB 136, L. 13-14, p. 213 and see above n. 197). He apparent, collected taxes in the area for the Patih and was later murdered in a mosque 5.
Suradilaga (see above n. 222) who seized the Sp. D. 2,000 in tax money he was carrying (SB 136, LIV. 22-6, p. 239). There was also another official by :=e name of Ng.

Yogya and Pacitan, see Bale Pustaka, Babad Gijanti Pratdlan namaning Tifan; lan Panggenan, p. 81) who was ordered to keep the padi (rice) for the Pua:s taxes of May 1825 to purchase arms (MvK 4132, 'Bylage Smissaert', Mas Nz Wiraprana to Danuréja, 16 Jul. 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 390: Secondly, a certain Nitikrama is mentioned as the Demang of Bulus in the Surakarta area who marched to join Dipanagara's forces in the attack on Yogya

in Aug. 1825 with rwo other. Surakarta Demangs (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825).

230 Sécanagara Tuménggung/Nglogorok desanira; this seems to refer to Muhamac Ngarfah, who rallied to Dipanagara at Sélarong, was appointed as Tumenggung Sécanagara, and took part in the campaign in Kédhu which led to the defeat and death of the Bupati of Magelang, R.T. Danuningrat (LOr 6547 b, XXII.
63-4, p. 389-90, XXII. 93-109, pp. 397-401 and see Louw, vol. 1, pp.
257-9; pp. 467-9). Smissaert mentioned the Naib (religious official) of the village of Logorok, a Surakarta hamlet opposite Pisangan on the Magelang- Yogya road who took part in the ambush of an expedition from Magelang to Yogya which led to the loss of bullion worth f. 28.000 and the death of 40 European soldiers on 24 Jul. 1825 (dK no. 181, Smissaert to Van der Capellen, 24 Jul.
1825). It is possible that this Nard was the same man. The name Ngarfah recalls the town of Arafa in Arabia, so it is possible he may have made che pilgrimage to Mecca. Portier in his account mentioned that TumEnggung SEcanegara had earlier borne the name of Jayamenggala (KITLV H 263, 'Verklaring , p. 25 and see above n. 166.)

231 Karangtalun Meriawijaya Tumenggung: on Mertawijaya see above n. 123.
Karangtalun is a village in the Bligo area, a spit of land berween the Praga and Krasak rivers, which was a Yogya enclave in S. K&dhu until 1830 (see Afdeling

2312 sinungan nawala sampunikang bongga pinatenan: instructions such as these can be clearly seen in the letter from Dipanagara to the chiefs of Kedhu which was carried by Hasan Besari at the end of July. This ordered the local population to collect arms, seize control of the province and further the Islamic religion. It

anyone refused to obey the instructions in the letter they were to be put to death (dK no. 182, P. le Clercq to De Kock, 29 Jul. 1825 enclosing the letter of Hasan Besari, and see further Muhammad Yamin, Sedjarah Peperangan Dipanagara, (Djakarta, 1952), p. 41 and Louw, vol. I, Bijlage XLVIII, who cite the letter in full).

232 ingaran wadya barandhal: brandhal means a good-for-nothing, a scoundrel, a predator, rebel and freebooter etc. (GR, vol. II, p. 668). The numbers of wong durjana in Dipanagara's ranks may have elicited the term (see above n. 36) and it was first used in a proclamation issued under the name of Sultan Hamengkubuwana V on 1 Sura, Wawu, A.J. 1753 (15 Aug. 1825) in which prices were set on the heads of captured rebels: for a Tumenggung, f. 1,000, for an important leader, f. 500, for a minor leader, f. 100 and for an ordinary brandhal, f.

-> KiTLV H 699, AvJ no. 28b, 'Bekendmaking', p. 35). Although it was used - .-. as a derisory expression it was also employed as a description for the

-in *'s of franc-tireurs (snipers) drawn from the villages which were set up by -- Sunan and MangkunEgara II in first months of the war to combat Dipanacara s supporters (see Louw, vol. I, p. 282).

~- o n dima jroning praja: this is confirmed in the other Javanese and Dutch reports of the situation inside Yogyakarta ar the time of Dipanagara's attacks - the town in Aug. 1825. On 1 Aug. Smissaert described an attack by LApanagara's supporters on the area of the wiste paal (Tugu) to the north of the * >wn where houses and warangs were burnt. Later, villages in the neighbourz od of Yogya were set alight and on 15 Aug. the dam of P. Paku Alam was urmt. The previous day (14 Aug.) the Chinese area (kampung cina) was fired <=: i pall of smoke hung over the town (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, . Aug. 1825, Id. to [d., 3 Aug. 1825; dK no. 181, Smissaert to De Kock, 13 Aug. and 14 Aug. 1825, and see further KITLV Or. 13, X. 35-44, pp. 112-5; 'a. adiningrat, 'Schetsen', p. 70; Louw, vol. I, p. 300). When Willem van Hogendorp later visited Yogya he reported that everything between the fort and the witse paal on the road to MagElang had been destroyed. This was partly because many Javanese nobles and priyayi had set fire to their own dalem; mefore going over to join Dipanagara in order to prevent them falling into <nemy hands, see H. Graaf van Hogendorp, pp. 173-4.

153 Walonda kakalib lampusiliya nandhang brana: see above n. 192. Only one Ambonese (?) was reported as killed on the Durch side and the cavalry commander, Lt. Thierry, later committed suicide (Chevallier, 'Dag-Register', 27 Jul. 1825 Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', p. 401). The psychological impact of killing Europeans was, however, of great importance. Thus, when a Dutch hussar was killed on 23 Aug. by a stab from a kris, his blood was drunk, and his head struck off and paraded around the town (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to P. le Clercq, 23 Aug. 1825 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 538 for reference to the custom of DN's troops of cutting off the heads of slain Dutch soldiers).

pamajegan kinen kumpul: this refers to the Surakarta officials who administered

. À (

lands in the Sala mancanagara arcas and who rendered their tax twice a year at Puasa and Mulud at the kraton (GR, vol. 1, p. 150). Presumably they were still in attendance in Surakarta because the Prass had just occurred (20

May 1825) and they were often held over to provide labour services (Afrigan) for the Sunan.

ngalun-alun pateban: the paseban was the area on the northern alun-alun of the Surakarta kraton which was used as a gathering place for ofhcials (GR, vol. I, p.
490). It should be noted that regarding this meeting at break of day on the alun-alun, the text as it now stands seems confused. It is unclear whether, once he had taken his leave of the Resident, the Raden Adipati entered a private

room in the peseban building or remained in the Residency. The latter seems to be implied by the text (see XI. 16 and XI. 23), but by the end of the canto (XJ.

28-29) it is clear that the Patih and his officials were already at the paseban.
When the transfer took place is not mentioned.

busanane prajuritan: the normal Javanese battle dress (prajwritan) is described by Gericke and Roorda (GR, vol. II, p. 241) as 'a kind of uniform with 62624 (kain about the lower body and legs) and celana (trousers) and Alambs siképan (a jacket worn when armed), #db&rg (headkerchief), one kris in the belt and one

hanging on a belt. There is a picrure of a Javanese noble dressed in prajuritan in Raffles, HJ. vol. I, p. 90 facing.

Historical Notes & Commentary

238 .... kulukan: refers to a state head-dress, which has fixed above it a small :.
shaped hat without a rim. The dress is usually worn by Javanese nobles i

officials at state ceremonies and by a Javanese bridegroom at his wedding (G?
vol. I, p. 490).

239 kadya Meru padma kobaripinganggone para Mantri: Meru refers to the h.
mountain Mt. Meru in India, the seat of Brahma, which is very important -the Javanese view as the symbol of cosmic power of the kraton and the rule (GR, vol. II, p. 479; Robert Heine-Geldern 'Conceptions of State and Kink ship in Southeast Asia', Cornell University Data Paper no. 18, (Ithaca, 1956) !Javanese mythology and literature Meru was supposed to be able to displa + itself to Java (see Pigeaud, Literature, vol. 11, p. 258). The striking red colou: of the payangs used by the Mantris at the courts probably prompted the

metaphor, see RAS, Raffles MSS. vol. 3, 'Miscellaneous Memorandum on the court of Solo (1816).

239aBupati Jro Arya Sasrakusumu wuslmyang Arya Sasrawinata: Raden Ria 53 rakusuma, who was a brother of R. Adip. Sasradiningrat, was a Sala Najat.
(Wedana Kiparak Têngën). Sasrawinata, who may also have been a relation o:

the Sala Patih, was in charge of road and bridge construction (see IOL Jav. 95 F, 'Pratelanipun abdi-Jalem Bupati ing Surakarta sadaya' (21812).

240 Srimtnganti......: the name of the northern outer gate of the innermost part o!

the kraton which led to the Sunan's private apartments. There was a péndbaps

there for receiving highly placed officials (GR, vol. I, p. 776; Winter, 'Beknopte Beschrijving , pp. 35-6).

241 ngandika Sri Naranatai .. kang ngatur: wnninga marang mami: the noncommittal and sphinx-like reply of the Sunan, Pakubuwana VI (1823-30), to the news that the Dutch had asked for reinforcements from Surakarta is indicative of his wavering attitude at the beginning of the Java War. Thus in the Buku, there is the description of a meeting between the Sunan and the Surakarta Patih, Sasradiningrat, at about this time, in which the former is described as having been very reluctant to provide troops for the Dutch but having been overruled by Sasradiningrat's advice that it was not yet the time to drive the Dutch from Java (KITLV Or. 13, XIV.28-38, pp. 151-3; on the dispatch of troops from Sala see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), p. 550). It is certain that he secretly sympathised with Dipanagara and in another passage in the Buku he is cast in the role of Prabu Baladewa, the ruler of Madura in the wayang theatre, who was strongly sympathetic to the Kurawa cause yet was tricked by Prabu Kresna into meditating at Grojogan Sewu and thus missed taking part in the Bratayuda, the final contest between Kurawa and Pandhawa (LOr 2163, XX124-9, p. 277; Carey, 'Cultural Ecology', pp. 44-6). There was much discontent in Surakarta at the time because of the ending of the land rent and recent annexations of territory (see Van der Kemp, 'De Economische Oorzaken', passim and the Introduction pt. IV), and through Kyai Maja the court was kept closely informed of events in Yogya (Van Pabst, 'Nota' (1826).
Indecd, the first notice of Dipanagara's preparations which was received by the Dutch, was the decision of the Demang of Grojogan, near Sala, to march to Yogya to join the prince's forces (see above n. 112). On 25 July, the Surakarta Resident, MacGillavry, wrote to Van der Capellen detailing the strength of popular discontent in manvanragara areas adjacent to Surakarta: '... I will not conceal from Your Excellency how much it cost me to hold the neighbouring eastern areas of Yogya under control. If the local chiefs decide to join the rebels, the oppressed people will be ready immediately to follow them and the Chinese are their first victims...... (dK no. 183, MacGillavry to Van der Capellen, 25 Jul. 1825, 10 p.m.) Although the Sunan gave permission for his troops

292

Babad Dipanagara

weep the road between Surakarta and Yogyakarta open, he sent a secret to his army commander, Major Tirtadiwiria, that if Dipanagara's troops zeavirated as far as they should be allowed to pass unhindered to rai MacGillavry thereupon sent an urgent request for De Kock to proceed * =~haith from Semarang to Surakarta (dK no. 183, MacGillavry to de Kock, -* Jul. 1825, 2.30 a.m.) De Kock's timely arrival on 30 July and his diploma... manner with the Sunan just prevented the defection of the Surakarta court *.: Dipanagara (see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), pp. 542-551, Louw, I, rr 2°4-6, p. 283, III, pp. 7-14). After De Kock's arrival, the AssistantRrsijent, A.D. Cornets de Groot, wrote that Surakarta remained very quiet : rnng the first month of the war and superhcially well-disposed towards the D.ich (KB. Cornets de Groot private coll. IX pr. 6, pp. 15-16, A.D. Cornets :: Groot Jr. to A.D. Cornets de Groot Sr., 2 Aug. 1829). Earlier, according to Nahuys van Burgst, P. Buminata, the Sunan's grand-uncle, had advised the s:aunchly pro-Duich prince, Mangkunegara II, to offer no resistance to Dipanagara's followers and the Sunan himself and the leading Surakarta Pangesans acquiesced in the plan. But the solace (ebas) afforded by the presence of De Kock in the Sunan's capital caused the members of the court to forego heir plans (on this see Van der Kemp, 'Brieven' (1896), pp. 555-556; dK 95, Nahuys van Burgst to De Kock, 2 Sept. 1828; De Kock to Nahuys van Burgst, i Sept. 1828; Louw, 1, pp. 275-6; II. pp. 362-6, 474; De Klerck, IV, pp.
i~S5 -87). Despite this change of heart, another serious anti-Dutch conspiracy ak place in 1828 involving the father and gran«father of che famous court poet Raden Ngabchi Ronggawarsita (1802-73) (see Jar. Cour. no. 69, 7 Jun.
1828 and the file on this incident in MvK 4132). As far as the Dutch were concerned the Sunan remained an unsatisfactory ally throughout the course of the war and his pilgrimage to Mancingan in June 1830 provided them with a useful pretext to exile him and raise P. Purbaya as Pakubuwana VI (see Laperan Politik Tahun 1837, pp. 59-60 and De Klerck, vol. VI, pp. 101-151).

.. Residhen Dbomis: Hendrik Jacob Domis (1782-1842) was Resident of Semarang (1822-27) and later served in Pasuruan (1828-31). He was the

author of two important published reports on Java, see T.J. Bezemer (ed.), Beknopte Encyclopaedia van Nederlandsch-Indie (s-Hage & Leiden, 1921), p. 137.

3 ng Redi Kidul kakalih: Gunung Kidul had been jointly held by Surakarta and

Yogyakarta since the treaty of Giyanti (1755). The region appears to have gone over to Dipanagara at the start of the war: thus on 29 July, Smissaert warned MacGillavry that the Sampar Palian area on the road to Pacitan, which was held jointly by the two courts, was providing support for Dipanagara (Dj. Br. 54, Smissaert to MacGillavry, 29 Jul. 1825; Van der Kemp, 'Hamlettype', pp.
1404-5) and early in August Dipanagara went there in person to gather troops (D;. Br. 54, Smissaert to Commander of Yogya garrison, 13 Aug. 1825).
Dipanagara's son, P. Dipaatmaja, was also active in the area (see Louw, vol. I, p. 378). Both Gunung Kidul and Pacitan were politically disturbed areas; much labour had been demanded in the former province to harvest the edible birds's nests (mainly at Rongkob), and in Pacitan forced labour had been employed on the coffee and pepper plantations. There had even been some decline in populauon in this latter area, after it had been annexed to the European government in 1812, because of the harshness of the estate system (AvJ. Nahuys van

Burgst to Van der Capellen, 2 Sept. 1822 and see Louw, vol. I, p. 578 n. 3 and R.A. Kern, 'Uit Oude Bescheiden (Geschiedenis van de Afdeeling Patjitan in

de Eerste helft der 19c eeuw) met bijlage', TBB, vol. 34 (1908), pp. 157293

Dutch in the area. It has not, however, been possible to identify and Resasemita, but a full account of this incident can be found in A.P. Bu >ler, 'Soerakarta vóór 63 jaren' TNI (1888) vol. II, p. 30.

244 Tawan Litnan Portir......: this refers to 2nd Lt. Paul Daniel Portier, inspector «« birds' nest rocks at Rongkob (opziener der vogelnestklippen te Rongkob) an: Adjutant (ordommans) of the Surakarta Residency (Regeerings A/lmanak (1825) ; 55). He was later captured by the Bupati of Pacitan, Kyai T. Jagakaria, in .
Sept. 1826 and was interviewed by Dipanagara. He affected to become a Mus lim after proving that he had been circumcised and had learnt various Islams prayers and the articles of the faith (Gahedat). He was given the name of Nur:salim, a horse, insignia and military rank, and Dipanagara wished to make hir the head of his administrators in Rongkob, because he placed more faith in h:: administration than that of a Javanese (Portier, 'Verklaring', p. 22; H. Graaf var.
Hogendorp, Wilem van Hogendorp in Nederlandsch-Indiée, 1825-1830, p. 15°C Portier later wrote an interesting account of his experiences with Dipanagara s

troops, see KITLV H 263, Portier, 'Verklaring', n.d. He should not be corfused with Ist Lt. Jan Pieter Portier who was Adjutant (ordonnans) of P. mang.

kunEégara II and took part in various compaigns with the MN troops, see Louw, 1, p. 386, p. 563 ff., p. 574. On the members of the Portier family in Sala at

this time, see MvK 3141, 'Register van het Europese personeele op Java.
(1823).

244a samya tugur ngalun-alun! .....lpra Bupati makajangan: tugur has the meaning of a special watch performed by court officials and members of the royal family at the time of the installation or death of a Javenese ruler (see GR, vol. I, p. 712). A Duich description of this practice at the time of the death of HB V in Yogya in June 1855 can be found in Dj. Br. 1, 'Politieke Verslag, 1855 At that time, the Yogya princes slept in the court pavilions (péndhapas) and the Patih and other officials camped out on the alun-ailun for over u month (4 Jun. - SJul. 1855) until the appointment of HB VI.

245 Tuwan Dhomis wus praptal.....lkang saking ing Surakarta: see above n. 201. The letters from Surakarta were first received by the Assistant-Resident of Semarang, J. A.R. Caspersz, because Domis was then absent inspecting the government opium estates at Kopeng. He only returned to Semarang on 22 July when he probably called the meeting described in this babad. Domis wrote that

all was peaceful but that passes had been issued to all Javanese who wished to travel to the villages (see below n. 249). On 24 July, when news reached him of the ambush of the Magélang expedition to Yogya (see above n. 230), he ordered the Bupatis of Kendhal and Démak to gather a large body of Javanese troops and post them on the southern frontier of the Residency to give news of any attack. Meanwhile, artillery was placed at Salatiga and the Jayeng Sékars (local mounted constabulary) were called up. On 26 July the Bupati of Semarang, R. Adip. Aria Cakranagara, was ordered to stay in Salatiga to organise the police force there (dK no. 180, Domis to alg. Secr., 22 Jul. 1825, Id. to Id., 24 Jul. 1825, 14. to Id., 26 Jul. 1825). The course of events in SEmarang after the receipt of the news of Dipanagara's rebellion, as it is related

Babad Dipanagara

- this babad, is thus substantially correct. See further Louw, vol. I, Chap. XIV, spc p. 372 and Van der Kemp (ed.), 'Brieven van en aan Mr. van de Graaff,

- _ Dipati wus mangsuklAriya Cakranagara: Cakranagara is mentioned in the

Rezerrings Almanak (1825), p. 54, as Bupati of SEmarang at the beginning of 'he Java War.

-+ Tauan Serwasis...... this seems to refer to Willem Nicolaas Servatius, Resident f Semarang (1820-22) and earlier J.A. van Braam's Assistant in Surakarta (see Quarles van Ufford, 'Naamlijst van Hoofden', p. 125, p. 127). It is possible that he might have been in Semarang at the outbreak of the war, but unlikely in view of the fact that he lived mostly at his estate at Kampongbaru in the Buitenzorg area (see De Haan, 'Personalia', p. 645). He later became Resident at Preanger in 1827 and died insolvent in the same year. The babad writer would probably have known of his name because of his earlier career in

Surakarta. There was also a Capt. J.J. Servais in SEmarang at the beginning of Aug. 1825, see Louw, vol. I, p. 296.

-+ : umembak para upesir: the senior officers in Semarang at the time were Col. F. von Jett, Commander of the 2nd Military Division and Col. J.A.
Hoorn who later replaced him, see Louw, vol. 1, p. 366 and Van der Kemp ed). 'Brieven .van en aan Mr. van de Graaff, vol. II. pp. 273-4.

48 kong kabawab ing Stmarang: the pasisir kabupatens under the control of Semarang at this time were Kendhal, Démak, and Grobogan. The two former areas had Assistant-Residents and Grobogan was administered by a European land-tax inspector (opziener van landelijk stelsel).

145 szrat genah.....: see above n. 245. The system of passes was not new and had been used earlier by Daendels to check the circulation of religious officials between the pasisir and the vorstenlanden (see J.A. Van der Chijs (ed.) Nederlandsch-Indisch Plakaatboek, 1602-1811, vol. XVI ('s-Hage, 1897), p.
409, order of 16 Herftsmaand (Sept.) 1810). In 1824 this regulation was still in force for Smissaen mentioned that a travel pass cost 45 duits (9 stuirers) (D).
Br. 53, Smissaert to Pres. of the Financial Board at Batavia, 18 Feb. 1824). A local pass was written on the left in Javanese and on the right in Dutch and was endorsed by the local Resident (see LOr 2168, no. 111, 'Binnenlandsche Pas voor (J.) F.C. Gericke', 19 Jul. 1828).

250 angangge sandi-upaya: in his survey of Old Javanese literature Prof. P.J. Zoetmulder gives the following description of the Old Jav. term xpZya sandhi: 'A well-known chapter in the Indian and Old Javanese treatises on the government of kings enumerate the four means (w#p2y4) of dealing with one's enemies. They are sama (negotiation), dana (bribery). bheda (sowing of discord) and dangda (violence). As the first two are considered to be peaceful means, they are classed under the term upaya sandhi. These non-violent means are also described

as "subtle means" (GZ&smopaya) or "secret means" (rahasyopaya) .....' (Zoetmulder, Kalangwan. A Survey of Old Javanese Literature, (The Hague, 1974), p.
182).

251 yen munggub saps upamailwijil sapi alasan. the reference here may be an allusion to the legend of the sapi Gumarang or lembu Gumarang, which is a figure connected with the rice myths of Dewi Sri and prince S&dana (Wisnu).

In the Bxka, the Kala Gumara:, story is referred to in connection with Dipanagara, when the latter's followe Kyai Jayanodin, receives a vision of the prince riding a cow as big as a h..
which had its feet caught in the roots of a Balaran vine. The cow broke loose and quickly carried Dipanagara off with it, thus depicting the destructive forces which would be unleashed in Java by Dipanagara: KITLV Or. 13. VII (Mas kumambang), p. 75: 10. .....

tur sami? trah ing Mataram: this is a general reference to the fact that Mang: kubumi and Dipanagara were descended from the Royal House of Mataram, of whom the Sultans of Yogyakarta formed one branch. See above n. 213 for

confirmation of the babad writer's shrewd assessment of Mangkubumi's character.

Regen sawiji tindhihe: see above n. 245, which describes the placing of Bupatis on the southern frontier of the Semarang Residency. The fact that the word Regen (Regent) is used and not the Javanese term Bupati is because the Bupatis of the pasisir areas had long been under the influence of the Dutch and were soon to become salaried officials of the colonial government. The title 'Regent

was used by the Dutch to refer to Bupatis under their administration. See further LW.C. van den Berg, De Inlandsche Rangen en Titels op Java en Madoera ('s-Gravenhage, 1902), pp. 61-64.

kadya (Apaka ginubah: this refers to the campaka or magnolia tree which has white or yellow tulip-shaped flowers and carries a very distinctive scent. The phrase cépakea ginubah (lit. 'like a finely shredded campaka') is used as an expression in Javanese to indicate someone whose heart is rent by grief, see De Clercq, Nieuw Plantkundig Woordenboek, p. 280, no. 2295 and GR, vol. I, p.
296. On Smissaert's attitude see above n. 153 and Van der Kemp, 'Hamlertype', p. 391. His inability in getting on with his subordinates at this time was described by Louw, vol. I, p. 280, and his fearfulness was remarked on by Van der Capellen, 'Aanteekeningen', p. 363.

raka Dyan Adipatya: normally a Dutch Resident would never address the Patih as 'elder brother' but rather as 'younger brother" (grs). The term may have been used here intentionally by che babad writer to indicate Smissaert's dependence on Danuréja (see the Introduction ptr. IV).

kang sami tinggal wismane: this is confirmed by Smissaert in a letter of 6 Aug.
1825 in which he noted that most of the kraton abds-daléms, officials and prajurits had deserted Yogya during the first two weeks of the war (Dj. Br. 54,
