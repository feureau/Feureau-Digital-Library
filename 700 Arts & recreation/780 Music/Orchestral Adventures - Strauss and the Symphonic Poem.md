# Orchestral Adventures: Strauss and the Symphonic Poem

A symphonic poem is an orchestral work, usually in one movement, based on a literary, historical, or other nonmusical source. The first composer to use the term symphonic poem was Franz Liszt (1811–86), who wrote 13 such works and was a leading proponent of program music, or music meant to show a particular scene or story. The symphonic poem was mainly a Romantic genre, although a few later examples also entered the standard repertory.

Taking historical events and scenes from everyday life as their subject, later nineteenth-century composers — especially those from Bohemia and Russia — used the symphonic poem as a way to demonstrate pride in their homelands. One notable example is Czech composer Bedřich Smetana’s cycle of six symphonic poems titled Ma vlast (“My Country”). Russian composers such as Modest Mussorgsky and Alexander Borodin, as well as French composers, including Claude Debussy, were also attracted to the genre.

The symphonic poem (or, as he preferred, tone poem) reached a peak with Richard Strauss (1864–1949), who applied his brilliant imagination and skill as an orchestrator to a range of extramusical themes. His ability to capture the essence of a character or situation, nowhere more evident than in Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks, made him a major influence in the development of film music.

Till Eulenspiegel’s Program

Although he had provided programs for the three tone poems that preceded it, Strauss was initially reluctant to do so for Till. Prior to the first performance of the work on November 5, 1895, he wrote to conductor Franz Wüllner, “I really cannot provide a program for Eulenspeigel” because “any words into which I might put the thoughts that the several incidents suggested to me would hardly suffice.” He did at least identify the two themes meant to depict Till, and explained that these pervade the work “in the most diverse disguises, moods, and situations.”

When German writer and composer Wilhelm Mauke wrote a guide to Till Eulenspiegel the following year, however, Strauss relented and wrote some annotations into Mauke’s score. These included detailed descriptions of five specific episodes: in the first four, Till causes various types of trouble, and in the fifth, he is hanged for his offenses.

Strauss’s first annotation comes at the very opening of the piece, where he wrote these words: “Once upon a time, there was a knavish fool named Till Eulenspiegel.” In this passage, the orchestra plays a short, folksy introduction before Till’s first theme appears in the first horn. Strauss constructed this theme in such a way that it cleverly captures Till’s mischievous personality: after entering on an “off” beat, it is then repeated twice, but each time one beat later so the listener never knows what to expect.

The next important event is the first statement of Till’s second theme by the solo D clarinet, where Strauss wrote, “That was a rascally scamp!” The mocking quality of the theme, coupled with the unique timbre of the D clarinet, vividly illustrates this characterization.
