# Orchestral Adventures: Strauss and the Symphonic Poem

A symphonic poem is an orchestral work, usually in one movement, based on a literary, historical, or other nonmusical source. The first composer to use the term symphonic poem was Franz Liszt (1811–86), who wrote 13 such works and was a leading proponent of program music, or music meant to show a particular scene or story. The symphonic poem was mainly a Romantic genre, although a few later examples also entered the standard repertory.

Taking historical events and scenes from everyday life as their subject, later nineteenth-century composers — especially those from Bohemia and Russia — used the symphonic poem as a way to demonstrate pride in their homelands. One notable example is Czech composer Bedřich Smetana’s cycle of six symphonic poems titled Ma vlast (“My Country”). Russian composers such as Modest Mussorgsky and Alexander Borodin, as well as French composers, including Claude Debussy, were also attracted to the genre.

The symphonic poem (or, as he preferred, tone poem) reached a peak with Richard Strauss (1864–1949), who applied his brilliant imagination and skill as an orchestrator to a range of extramusical themes. His ability to capture the essence of a character or situation, nowhere more evident than in Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks, made him a major influence in the development of film music.

## Till Eulenspiegel’s Program

Although he had provided programs for the three tone poems that preceded it, Strauss was initially reluctant to do so for Till. Prior to the first performance of the work on November 5, 1895, he wrote to conductor Franz Wüllner, “I really cannot provide a program for Eulenspeigel” because “any words into which I might put the thoughts that the several incidents suggested to me would hardly suffice.” He did at least identify the two themes meant to depict Till, and explained that these pervade the work “in the most diverse disguises, moods, and situations.”

When German writer and composer Wilhelm Mauke wrote a guide to Till Eulenspiegel the following year, however, Strauss relented and wrote some annotations into Mauke’s score. These included detailed descriptions of five specific episodes: in the first four, Till causes various types of trouble, and in the fifth, he is hanged for his offenses.

Strauss’s first annotation comes at the very opening of the piece, where he wrote these words: “Once upon a time, there was a knavish fool named Till Eulenspiegel.” In this passage, the orchestra plays a short, folksy introduction before Till’s first theme appears in the first horn. Strauss constructed this theme in such a way that it cleverly captures Till’s mischievous personality: after entering on an “off” beat, it is then repeated twice, but each time one beat later so the listener never knows what to expect.

After a short interpolation from the orchestra, the first horn plays the theme again. It is then taken up in turn by the oboes, clarinets, and other sections of the orchestra.

The next important event is the first statement of Till’s second theme by the solo D clarinet, where Strauss wrote, “That was a rascally scamp!” The mocking quality of the theme, coupled with the unique timbre of the D clarinet, vividly illustrates this characterization.

## Till Makes Trouble

The first major episode depicts Till riding on horseback through the market-women and running away in “seven-league boots.” It’s not hard to envision the wares from the market stalls toppling into the street and the angry cries of the market-women as Strauss uses all the musical means at his disposal to create this chaotic scene.

In the second major episode, Till mocks religion by masquerading as a priest, “oozing unction and morality” as he pontificates. Strauss reminds us that Till is beneath the disguise by having the low voices play his second theme and using the solo D clarinet and violin to peek out of the orchestra. After all the fun, we hear a foreboding passage (0:48) in which Till is “seized with a horrid premonition as to the outcome of his mockery of religion.” Indeed, when we come to the execution scene, the judge’s sentence is a version of Till’s mock sermon.

Till decides to try his hand at womanizing in the third episode, which features a syrupy version of his first theme. Till’s flirting turns to true love, but when the object of his desire gently rejects him, he doesn’t take it well. Strauss illustrates Till’s outraged vow to “take revenge on all mankind” with an elongated, fortissimo version of his second theme by the brass section, culminating with a final shaking of the fist with the horns at triple forte. He’s soon back to himself, however, and whistles as he contemplates his next prank.

In the fourth episode Till takes on the smug, ignorant philistines, satirized by Strauss with a pompous theme in the bassoons and bass clarinet. Again in disguise, Till mocks them with “atrocious theses” that leave them dumbfounded. As conductor and author Norman Del Mar observed, “The music in this section is splendidly ingenious, depicting the hopeless complexity of their professorial deliberations which flounder in the mire like so many hippopotami.” Taunting them with his second theme, Till reveals himself and then gambols away singing a common “street ditty.”

## From Triumph to Dread

Strauss provided no annotations for the next two episodes, though episode 5 is marked “fleeting and ghostly” in the score. Episode 6 begins with the triumphant reappearance of Till’s first theme in the horns, heralding a varied recapitulation of the first major section of the piece. The final episode portrays Till’s sentencing and execution. Hauled in before the judges, Till first “whistles nonchalantly,” but the premonition music from episode 2 returns as he realizes his pranks have finally caught up with him.

Strauss describes Till’s execution by hanging as follows: “Up the ladder with him! There he dangles, the breath leaves his body, the last convulsion and Till’s mortal self is finished.” To illustrate this scene, the D clarinet climbs to the topmost note of its upper range and holds it for a moment until a slow descent in the flute gruesomely mimics Till’s final shudder. But the epilogue, with its return to the “once upon a time” theme, offers a consoling suggestion that Till as an archetype, at least, cannot be extinguished.

In contrast to the lucidity of its programmatic content, the structure of this work is puzzling. Its complete title — Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks, After the Old Rogue’s Tale, Set in Rondo Form — strongly implies that Strauss conceived it as a rondo, yet it doesn’t behave as one. Most obviously, while it contains distinct episodes, they are not separated by restatements of a refrain.

On the other hand, it includes important elements of sonata form design, most notably a recapitulation of the opening material at a plausible point. Read this way, all of the music through episode 2 serves as an exposition; episodes 3-6 function like a development; and the return to the opening “refrain” signals the start of a recapitulation in which episode 7 irregularly resides.

In his article “Framing Till Eulenspiegel,” music scholar James Hepokoski points out that Strauss utilized “sophisticated sonata deformations” that were tied to the programmatic content in his three previous symphonic poems. In keeping with this tradition, it seems that the character of Till might well have inspired Strauss to play a few pranks on his listeners in his fourth.
