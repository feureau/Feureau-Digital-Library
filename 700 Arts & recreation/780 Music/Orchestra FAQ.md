## What is the definition of an orchestra?

The word orchestra originally referred not to a group of musicians, but to a place. In ancient Greece and Rome, it was the ground level of an amphitheater, and during the Renaissance the term was similarly applied to the area in front of the stage where instrumentalists sat and accompanied singing and dancing performances. By the eighteenth century, the term had acquired its present meaning of designating the ensemble itself.

The orchestra as we know it today arose during the seventeenth century, although large groups of instrumentalists existed long before (and after) that time. The central defining feature of an orchestra, as opposed to other such ensembles, is the presence of a core group of bowed string players. From the eighteenth century on, this group has been organized into sections that feature an unequal distribution of players, with violinists as the largest. In each section, the instrumentalists usually play the same notes. In addition to the strings, orchestras generally include a variety of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments.

## When was the first orchestra formed?

According to many music historians, the first real orchestra in Europe was the Grande Bande, also known as the Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi (24 Violins of the King), established by Louis XIII in 1626. This ensemble included five different sizes of violin-family instruments and later became famous under the direction of composer Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–87), a favorite dancer and musician of Louis XIV. Lully was a highly disciplined musician who may have originated the practice of uniform bowing, a practice in which all the players in a section move their bows in the same direction at once.

## What is the role of the conductor?

The tradition of a conductor holding a baton and leading the orchestra from a podium did not emerge until the nineteenth century. Prior to this time, the first violinist or keyboard player frequently served as the director. This individual was often a court-appointed musician who also served as the ensemble’s principal composer. Other times these musicians would stand to the side of the orchestra and beat time with a stick. (This practice proved most unfortunate for Lully, who struck his foot while doing so and contracted a fatal case of gangrene.)

As orchestras grew in size and music became increasingly more complex, the need for a visibly prominent conductor who could focus attention solely on the ensemble became apparent. The first musician to stand in front of the orchestra and conduct with a baton was reportedly German composer and conductor Louis Spohr (1784–1859). Others quickly followed suit, and conducting technique became much more refined throughout the nineteenth century. While the close connection between composing and conducting persisted, conducting became an independent and increasingly influential profession.

In addition to making sure the orchestra stays together, which alone can be quite challenging in many cases, modern conductors have to make interpretive decisions about how to perform a given work. One case in point is tempo, which might be absent from the score or given only as a general indication (e.g. “fast”). Theoretically, the invention of the metronome in the early 1800s made it possible for composers to indicate precisely their desired tempi. One of the first composers to take advantage of this was Beethoven, but some of his metronome markings are so improbable that conductors have almost unanimously ignored them. A paper published by the American Mathematical Society in 2013 offers evidence that Beethoven’s metronome may in fact have been broken.

## What are other important positions in the orchestra?

The leading role within the orchestra is that of the concertmaster (principal first violin). The concertmaster sits immediately to the left of the conductor and serves as the main liaison between the orchestra and conductor. He or she also determines bowings for the section and plays any violin solos that occur within an orchestral work. This role is a vestige from earlier times when the orchestra was often led by the first violinist. In some orchestras, including the Berliner Philharmoniker, more than one individual holds this position.

Each section of the orchestra also has one or more principals who serve as a section leader and perform any solos that are called for. The principal oboist has the added responsibility for tuning the orchestra at the start of a concert. (Some orchestras now use an electronic device to sound the tuning pitch, in which case the oboist turns it on and off.)

## How are seating arrangements for the orchestra determined?

Seating arrangements for orchestras remained highly variable throughout the nineteenth century and still depend on a variety of factors, including the repertoire, acoustical properties of the performance venue, and preferences of the conductor. Generally, however, the first violins are on the conductor's left and percussion is in the back.
