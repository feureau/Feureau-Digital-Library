# Firsts in the Ninth: Beethoven and the Symphony

The symphony as we understand it today has its origins in the late seventeenth century, when the term sinfonia (Italian for “symphony”) most frequently referred to a short overture-type piece in three sections or movements. From the early Classical period onwards, it described a substantial orchestral work, most often in four movements.

The symphonies of Joseph Haydn (who wrote more than 100!) were noteworthy for their flexible and highly varied treatment of musical material, a feature that strongly influenced Mozart’s approach to the genre. By the time of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), the symphony was the most highly regarded instrumental genre. It typically included a fast first movement in sonata form, a slow second movement, a minuet and trio as the third movement, and another fast movement, generally lighter in character than the first and often a rondo, to close.

In the hands of Beethoven, the symphony experienced an expansion in size, complexity, and emotional depth. All of these characteristics reached new heights in Beethoven’s Ninth, by far the longest symphony composed at that time and the first to include voices. These were just some of the many attributes that set this great symphony apart from those that came before.

## First Movement: Allegro ma non troppo e un poco maestoso

Like that of Mozart’s K. 271 piano concerto, the first movement of Beethoven’s Ninth is noteworthy for its innovative departures from sonata-form conventions. Naturally it has a very different character than Mozart’s work, which for all its surprises is still a model of clarity and restraint. Just as those qualities are readily apparent in the concerto, where it takes Mozart only two measures to establish the key and meter, the gripping yet elusive quality of Beethoven’s movement is evident from the very outset.

For the first 16 measures of the movement, Beethoven leaves the key up in the air and avoids any kind of steady rhythm that would suggest a definite meter. The resulting sound, unprecedented in its lack of clarity, suggests to some listeners that of an orchestra tuning up. The build-up from pianissimo (very soft) to fortissimo (very loud) over these measures culminates in a statement by the full orchestra that finally confirms the key and meter. Despite this clarification, the theme presented here still has no real tune, and sounds more like generic transitional material. In fact, the starting point of the main theme is debatable: is it only after the 16 “introductory” measures, or does it include them?

Following the first statement of the main theme, we would expect Beethoven either to restate it literally or transition to the second theme. Instead, he repeats the entire passage with two significant alterations: the introductory section now uses the “correct” notes for D minor (D and A, as opposed to A and E) and the tutti statement is in a different key, B-flat major.

## An Unprecedented Event

Another striking formal event takes place at the end of the exposition, which Beethoven repeated in each of his previous eight symphonies. Here, instead of taking the repeat, he re-uses the introductory material (now back on the original pitches, A and E) to initiate what turns out to be the development section.

This material comes back for a fourth time at the recapitulation, but now with F sharp instead of D in the bass. As a result, the passage is 1) in D major rather than D minor and 2) less harmonically stable. As Beethoven scholar Lewis Lockwood notes, it is also “a passage unparalleled in fury and power in the whole history of orchestral music up to this time.”

The movement’s lengthy coda features a type of descending chromatic bass line traditionally used to symbolize death. Its forceful and furious finale conclusively ends this dark movement with a cadence from the main theme.

## Second Movement: Molto vivace

The second movement is a scherzo, and Beethoven’s placement of it here rather than as the third movement was unprecedented. Since the first movement of a symphony was traditionally the most substantial (though not necessarily the longest), the standardized four-movement plan with a slow second movement gave the listener time to relax and recover. But in this most demanding of symphonies, Beethoven clearly has other priorities.

The word scherzo literally means “joke” in Italian, and as a musical form during the nineteenth century — when it came to replace the minuet and trio as a lively inner movement, usually in three-quarters time, of a symphony or instrumental chamber work — the scherzo could entail an element of dark or savage humor. Certainly that is the case in this movement.

In the eight introductory measures, Beethoven starts off with a kind of musical in-joke by establishing a vividly orchestrated pattern of motive (BUM!-da-dum)-rest-motive-rest and immediately disrupting it with one of motive-motive-rest-rest. The scherzo proper begins with a fugue in the strings and gradually builds in loudness to a unified statement of the theme by the full orchestra — including the first appearance of the timpani since the introduction.

As customary, the scherzo contains a contrasting trio section, but Beethoven once again subverts the listener’s expectations by offering a hard driving presto in cut time in place of a relaxed dance in triple meter.

## Third Movement: Adagio molto e cantabile

Showing Beethoven at his most lyrical, the third movement offers a marked contrast to the previous two. Its form is somewhat ambiguous, but can be interpreted as a double set of variations in which Beethoven bends the rules by varying the first theme several times, and the second theme only once. This is an appealing theory given that the “banished” theme is in the key of D major, whose struggle to overcome D minor is a major plot of the symphony; by tantalizing the listener with this fleeting appearance, the triumph of D major in the final movement has even greater impact.

## Fourth Movement: Presto

While the inclusion of voices in this massive movement was certainly a “first,” the complexity of its formal design is also without precedent and an even greater testament to Beethoven’s genius. On one level, it is a “symphony within a symphony” that replicates the structure of the symphony as a whole. Its four sections are as follows:

Part 1 (mm 1–330): slow intro to theme and variations (first three are instrumental, fourth introduces voices)
Part 2 (mm 331–593): six-eight scherzo/“Turkish” march
Part 3 (mm 594–653): slow section
Part 4 (mm 654–940): fast finale with fugato (Turkish instruments come back at m. 851)
At the same time, it is a gargantuan theme and variations in which parts 2–4 function as variations on Part 1. Added to all of this is the presence of elements that suggest various other genres, both instrumental and vocal.

## A Dramatic Start

The movement begins with an explosive, chaotic seven-measure passage that composer Richard Wagner aptly termed the Schrekensfanfare (“fanfare of terror”). In retrospect, it is now clear that whether or not this was Beethoven’s primary intention, the reversal of the scherzo and adagio movements results in a much more dramatic beginning for the final movement following the peace and calm that preceded it.

After the introduction, the first major section of Part 1 begins as a series of exchanges between the full orchestra (minus strings) and the cellos and basses. In this long introduction, Beethoven quotes the openings of the first three movements, rejecting each in turn with forceful recitatives in the lower strings.

Finally, there is a hint of a new, simple theme in D major and we hear one last recitative. As the next section begins, the lower strings state the fully formed theme famously known as the “Ode to Joy” (an English translation of “An die Freude,” the title of the Schiller poem sung by the chorus and soloists in this movement).

## The Voices Enter

Following three variations on the “Ode to Joy” theme by the orchestra, we hear a restatement of the opening fanfare. This announcement heralds the first entrance of voices into the symphony, as the baritone soloist conclusively rejects all the themes from the past and welcomes the more joyous one at hand with Beethoven’s own words: “Not these tones, they remind us of our doubts, Oh no, not this theme either! I want something more pleasing. Yes, this is it; now we have found it. Joy!”

## March to the Finish

Part 2 is a variation in the guise of a “Turkish” march, a musical style inspired by Turkish military bands that was popular during the time of Mozart and Beethoven. Here Beethoven authenticates the style by introducing the typical battery of instruments — triangle, cymbals, and bass drum — into the symphony for the first time. Joining these are a piccolo, a contrabassoon, and a large wind band.

Set in a broad triple meter, and opening with the tenors and basses from the chorus singing in unisons and octaves, the relatively brief slow section (Part 3) re-creates an aura of Renaissance majesty. The fourth and final section brings the orchestra, soloists, and chorus together in a bravura tour de force. It begins with a double fugue on the “Ode to Joy” theme, with the third movement theme serving as the countersubject, and concludes with a huge fantasy-like coda of unsurpassed jubilation.
