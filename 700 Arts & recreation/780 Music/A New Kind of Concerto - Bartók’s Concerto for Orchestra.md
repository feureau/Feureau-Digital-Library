# A New Kind of Concerto: Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra

A concerto for orchestra is a concerto in which each instrument or section of the orchestra — as opposed to a single individual — is treated as a soloist. Although it is a relatively new category, it shares important similarities with (and was consciously inspired by) the Baroque concerto grosso, which included a small group of soloists among the orchestra. The number of movements is variable.

The earliest concertos for orchestra are those by Paul Hindemith (1925), Walter Piston (1933), and Zoltán Kodály (1939–40). It was Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (1943), however, that became the gold standard by which all subsequent examples were measured. In the decades since its premiere, many other prominent composers, including Witold Lutosławski, Elliott Carter, Jennifer Higdon, and Tan Dun have written works with the same title or concept.

Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra is made up of five movements arranged, like many of his other compositions, in a symmetrical “arch” form, with a central middle movement framed by two shorter inner movements and two large-scale outer movements. In his program note for the Concerto’s premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on December 1, 1944, Bartók’s wrote that “the general mood of the work represents — apart from the jesting second movement — a gradual transition from the sternness of the first movement and the lugubrious death-song of the third, to the life-assertion of the last one.”

You may notice that the sound of this piece is quite different from those we explored in the previous four modules. This is because Bartók was a modernist whose style is often described as a fusion of Western classical and Eastern European folk traditions, as well as “new” and “old” musical forms and procedures. As one of his last compositions after a lifetime of experimentation and refinement, the Concerto for Orchestra offers a compelling illustration of this synthesis.

## Sundry Sounds

The first movement (“Introduzione”) begins with a lengthy introduction at a moderately slow tempo. Its first theme, introduced at the opening by the cellos and basses, is later transformed into an accompaniment to the second theme, which is first heard in the flute and then taken up by other sections of the orchestra.

The second part of the movement, signaled by a change of meter and faster tempo (Allegro vivace), begins with a statement of the primary theme in the violins. Bartók scholar David Cooper notes that the metrical irregularity of the theme is similar to the “aksak” Bulgarian rhythm Bartók used in a number of other works.

The tempo changes to a slower "Tranquillo" for the statement of the exotic-sounding secondary theme by the oboe. As Cooper notes, this theme strongly resembles a type of melody Bartók collected in Biskra, North Africa, during a field trip in 1913.

## Developments

The development section falls into three parts, delineated by continuing alternations in tempo (Tempo 1-Tranquillo-Tempo 1). While the exposition highlights Bartók’s integration of classical and indigenous musical traditions, the development shows his synthesis of old and modern idioms in its use of contrapuntal procedures associated with the Baroque, such as fugue and canon.

Bartók’s program notes indicated that this and the fifth movement were “written in a more or less regular sonata form,” but the recapitulation brings back the secondary theme before the primary theme. (While not routine, this practice occurred on occasion during the Classical era. Here, it results in another example of Bartók’s favored “arch” form.) Another major nonconformity is the alternation between the two tempos, which suggests a “ritornello” structure typical of the Baroque concerto grosso.

## Pairing Up

Out of the Concerto’s five movements, it is the second, “Gioco delle coppie” (“Game of Couples”), that is most reminiscent of the concerto grosso in its alternation of soloists with the full orchestra. Here, five consecutive pairs of wind instruments introduce short sections in what Bartók described as a “chain” structure. There is a short chorale for brass and side drum (without snares) before the five sections return with a more elaborate instrumentation.

Each pair plays the same melody at different pitches, but the interval between these pitches is new for each pair. In addition to this common treatment, the “chain” sections are unified at strategic points of the movement by the side drum, which functions as a sort of “master of ceremonies.”

## Mourning and Night

The third movement, titled “Elegia,” opens with an example of Bartók’s “night music” idiom, which uses the unique capabilities of the orchestra to invoke the nocturnal sounds of the natural world and its creatures. (You may have noticed hints of this in the first movement’s introduction.)

This opening passage (A) is followed by a transition to another symmetrical succession of three themes (aba). The first and third use material from the introduction of the first movement, while the second brings in a mournful folklike melody that Bartók specialist Yves Lenoir connected to Transylvanian funeral songs — a fitting reference considering Bartók’s characterization of the movement as a “lugubrious death-song.” Listen to the "b" theme, which is located at the core of the movement and, by extension, the Concerto as a whole.

The movement concludes with a truncated return of the opening “night music,” suggesting an overall symmetrical, or “arch,” structure of three main ABA sections in which the middle section (B) exhibits the same three-part form in miniature for this elegy: A-B(=aba)-A. Thus, the structure of the middle section of the movement replicates the structure of the movement as a whole.

## Fourth Movement and Finale

In the fourth movement, entitled “Intermezzo Interrotto” (“Interrupted Intermezzo”), Bartók interrupts the otherwise placid proceedings with a quotation from Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 7 in C Major ("Leningrad"), a work that was highly popular with American audiences in the early 1940s. According to conductor Antál Doráti, Bartók’s intent with this interruption may have been to caricature a work he thought was overrated, but there are other, conflicting theories, including one suggesting that both Shostakovich and Bartók were parodying a tune from Franz Lehár’s operetta The Merry Widow. Bartók said nothing about the content of this movement in his program notes, stating only that its form “could be rendered by the letter symbols ‘A B A-interruption-B A’.” The theme of the movement's opening “A” section is reminiscent of Slovakian peasant music and, according to David Cooper, the music of the “B” section may be a reference to an operetta aria entitled “You are lovely, you are beautiful, Hungary.”

The other “more or less regular sonata form” movement of the Concerto, the presto (very fast) “Finale” opens with a triumphant fanfare in the horns. The opening section of the exposition consists of four subsections based on Romanian folk dance styles, with the first of these cleverly orchestrated to mimic a Romanian gypsy band. These are unified by a continuous fast-running figuration in the strings, an effect known as “moto perpetuo” (perpetual motion). Listen to the first section of the Finale and notice the “strumming” effect in the violas and cellos.

This exuberant whirlwind of activity gives way to a transitional passage based on the opening fanfare. The closing section of the exposition witnesses a new fanfare in the trumpets and return of the perpetual-motion figuration. Listen to the two statements of the new fanfare and notice how Bartók varies the second one by “inverting” it, or turning it upside down.

The tempo slows for the development section, which is mainly occupied with various contrapuntal treatments of the new fanfare. The return of the perpetual-motion activity signals the start of the recapitulation, which is the least “regular” part of the movement. Here the material from the exposition is re-harmonized and sizably shortened by the entrance of a new “Tranquillo” section. This is followed by an even faster presto passage in which the strings play sul ponticello (with the bow near the bridge), creating an eerie effect. The mood turns bright again as the brass instruments issue a fortissimo statement of the second fanfare, heralding the brilliant conclusion to this remarkable work. (This is actually not the original ending: a few weeks after the premiere, at Koussevitzky’s request, Bartók composed this now-preferred second, slightly longer version.)
