THE HISTORY AND OBJECTS

or THE

FOUNDLING HOSPITAL.

Ir is related, that when Captain Thomas Coram, the Founder of this Hospital, resided at Rotherhithe, about the year 1720, his avocations obliging him to go early_ into the city, and return late, he frequently saw infants '

exposed and deserted in the public streets ; and as ' there was but one step in his active mind from the .

knowledge of an evil to a desire for remedying it, he immediately set about inquiring into the probable causes for so outrageous a departure from humanity and natural affection.

He knew, what every man who studies the human heart must know—that the motive to such a dereliction of maternal duty must be beyond the ordinary casualties of indigence. He was not long in discovering the true source of the evil. He found that it arose out of a morbid morality, then possessing the public mind, by which an unhappy female, who fell a victim to the seductions and false promises of a designing man, was left to hopeless contumely, and irretrievable disgrace.
Neither she nor the offspring of her guilt appear to have been admitted within the pale of human compassion : her first false step was her final doom, without 2

even the chance, however desirous, of returning to the road of rectitude. All the consideration which was given to her condition, was the enactment of laws to bring her to punishment, after she had been driven to the commission of the worst of crimes : for the error of a day,. she was punished with the infamy of years ; and although her departure from the path of virtue, so far from being the consequence of a previous vicious disposition, might have been brought about by an artful scheme of treachery, she was branded for ever as a woman habitually lewd. These—evils necessarily increased the quantum of cerime in society, according to the manner in which they operated upon the unfortunate individuals under their influence ;—still n0 one stepped forward to provide a remedy. The legislature, from time to time, condemned the unhappy wretch to capital punishment who should, in the madness of despair, lift her arm against the child of her guilt ; but it never once considered the means by which both parent and child might be saved from destructiou : yet, by a strange perversity, those very laws bore on the face of them evidence of the necessity and justice of some more Christian proceeding. In all of them, the crime for which the punishment was awarded, is stated to have been committed from a desire in the mother to ”avoid ker shame.” Surely the woman who would make so great a struggle to preserve her reputation, as to break the natural ties which bind parent to offspring, who is willing to forego the endearments which are the fruits of her situation, by either gacrificing or deserting her child, cannot 3

with justice, be charged as habitually lewd !—a lewd woman has no shame to hide—she makes a show of her guilt, and claims, in open day,‚, the protection which she knows has been provided for her by the poor—laws.
But when a woman, with a sense of honour, finds herself the unsuspecting victim of treachery, with the witness of her disgrace hanging about her neck‚ in the person of her child, left to the reproach of the world and her own conseience, and seeing no other means of saving her character, she becomes delirious in her despair, and vents her fury on the consequence of her seduction—the child of her seducer ! Hence the murder and desertion of children became alarming evils—evils which were produced and perpetuated ” for want” (to use the words of Captain Coram) ”of proper means for preventing the disgrace and succouring the necessitres of their parents.” He therefore proposed to erect a sanctuary, to which these wretched mothers might fiy, and there deposit the offspring and the secret of an unhallowed intercourze,

and be thus enabled to return to that path from which they had unguardedly strayed. A

This was doubtless the object of Captain Coram.

In all his memorials to persons of distinction, soliciting their support, he ascribes to the parent, as —the motive

of her cruel conduct towards her offspring, a desire to

preserve her reputation,—to ”hide ker shame ;” and in

Hogarth's design, illustrating the views of the Founder,

it will be seen that he makes him hold personal communion with the penitential mother, pouring into her

heart the oil of gladness, whilst he relieves her of the 4

child of her sorrow. To accomplish his purpose of founding an Hospital for the objects described, Captain Coram, with his usual zeal, endeavoured to enlist the sympathies of the humane and charitable. He soon found, however, that there were obstacles in the way.
They who admitted the evil, questioned the remedy, and doubted whether it might not prove greater than the disease, He was for seventeen years combating public opinion on this head, and though he at last prevailed, it was after many contests between himself and others as to the probable issue. Can it be wondered at, therefore, that in addressing the President at the first meeting of the Governors after the charter had been granted, he should throw out a suggestion, that its success could only be secured ”provided due and proper care be taken for setting on foot so necessary an establishment.” This, besides being dictated by his own good sense, was also forced upon him by those who aided in his scheme, and was the condition upon which they gave him their support. ”This due and proper care ” could only refer to the selection of the objects, and it will be seen in succeeding pages with what absence of forethought the Hospital was ”set on foot,” and the evil consequences which arose therefrom.

| __ At the very outset an error was committed. Captain

Coram, and those who assisted him, petitioned for two

_ objects : —first, to ”prevent the frequent murders of poor

: _ miserable infants at their birth ;” secondly ”to suppress

the inhuman custom of exposing new—born infants to

' perish in the streets.” Now to accomplish these

: objects, the Charter incorporated an ” Hospital for the 5

' maintenance and education of exposed and deserted ; young children,”* thus giving a license to that which ' was contrary to law, and which the memorialists were desirous to suppress. It was clear, therefore, that such a charter, though beneficial as regards the rights and privileges which it gave to the Governors, as a corporation, was useless as respected the main object, namely, the admission of children,—and so it proved. In the next session of Parliament, after the charter was granted, the Governors found it necessary to frame a bill to expfatn and enlarge the powers granted to them.
This bill passed into a law ; and the preamble affords the explanation required, by stating that the Hospital is for infants who are Zable to be exposed in the streets, or to be murdered by their parents. Now there are two causes which may suggest themselves to the reader.
as likely to lead to the exposition or destruction of infants: namely, inability of parents to maintain them, or a wanton inkhkumantty. With respect to the first,though this miserable plea has been sanctioned in countries where humanity and morality have made but



* ”It seems to have been a general mistake in establishing the Hospital, that we founded our argumente for it, and the great principle of the plan, upon the practice of other nations drawing our conclusions with too little attention to the genius of our own. Where the arm of arbitrary power wrings from the hands of peasants the poor remains of the produce of their daily labour, and makes no provision to supply their wants, but such as the charity of Religious Houses furnishes, as was the caso with us, before the days of Queen Elizabeth, the comparison cannot hold. Where property is not sacred, industry cannot flourish ; and where commerce does not furnish employment, misery cannot be so well kept at arms length. In countries where the soil is less fertile, and showers from Heaven do not create plenty, want will more generally abound.”—Jongas Hanmway, an active Governor, 1756 to 1787.
6

little progress, yet in England it is altogether without foundation, for the wise and systematic provision which has been made for the relief of indigence, by the institution of poor—laws, takes from poverty the desperate alternative to which it might otherwise be exposed. As to the second cause—wanton inhumanity, it may be said, that however the barbarous policy of eastern countries may render callous the human heart to the calls of parental affection,—in this country, where the mild influences of Christianity strengthen and support the natural ties which bind parent to offspring, the wanton sacrifice of infant life is happily of rare occurrence. It will then be asked, ” whAat children are lable to be exposed and destroyed by their parents ?” ©It is answered,—the children of those wretched mothers, before described, whose combination of mental and bodily distress admits of no partial relief,—n0 relief which the poor—law can effectually bestow. These were the objects which fell under the compassionate consideration of Captain Coram,

= — and the non—attention of the early Governors to his

cautionary suggestion, produced as might have been expected, most lamentable consequences, and caused the Founder himself to secede from the Council Board of the Institution.



MEMOIR OF THE FOUNDER.

Captain Coram was born at Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, in the year 1668. He was a descendant 7

of the Corhams, of Devonshire; and EKinterbury, in that county, was for several generations, the property and residence of the family.* Of his baptism, there does not appear to be any record_ at Lyme Regis ; and all that can be found in the registers relating to the family is the following ;” William, son of John Coram, Captain, was baptized at Lyme, April 29th, 167L.”t

There seems to be no doubt, therefore, that this ” William” was a younger brother of ”Thomas,” the subject of this memoir, and consequently, that the latter, in devoting himself to the sea service, followed the occupation of his father. At Lyme Regis, which is a sea—port‚, there was carried on, at the period in question, a considerable coasting and Newfoundland trade ; and hence we may venture to account for the first direction of his course in maritime concerns,

Of his early years there is no biographical notice extant ; but it appears probable that the ardent temperament which he exhibited through life, was too strong for the restraints of home and domestic ties, and that this, and his love of enterprise, caused him to be‚ even at the outset of his career, an independent member of his father's family.

About the year 1694 (he being then twenty—six years old), we find him at Taunton, Massachusetts, in the United States, exercising the humble trade of a shipwright. To this new country, he had, doubtless,

gone in the spirit of adventure ; and here he gave the first instance on record of that public devotedness for which he was so remarkable. Whilst in this comparative wilderness, he perceived, with regret, the uncivilized condition of the inhabitants, by reason of the absence of systematic religion, as exercised by the Church of England, of which he was a member.
By a deed, therefore, dated 8th December, 1703, he conveyed to the Governor and other authorities of Taunton, fifty—nine acres of land. The condition of — the gift was this,—that whenever, in the progress of eivilization and the increase of population, the people of the place should desire the Church of England to be established there, that then, on their application to the vestrymen, or their successors in office, the land, or a suitable part of it, was to be granted for that purpose, or for a school—house, as they might desire. This gift, the deed alleges, was made ”in consideration of the love and respect which the donor had and did bear unto the said church as also for divers other good causes and considerations him especially at that present moving.” In this deed he is described as ” of Boston, in New England, sometimes residing in Taunton, in the County of Bristol, Shipwright.” At a subsequent period of his life he presented to the parish of Taunton a valuable library, part of which remains to this day. Some of the books appear to have been solicited by Coram from others. Thus, in the copy of Common Prayer now .
preserved in the church, the entry in the title pagé is as follows :—” This Book of Common Prayer is 9

given by the Right Honourable Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons of Great Britain, one of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, and Treasurer of His Majesty's Navy, &ec., to Trhomas Coram, of London, Gentleman, for the use of a Church, lately built at Taunton, in New England.” Coram appears to have obtained the warm friendship of Mr. Speaker Onslow, of the evidence of which this is not the only instance.

From Taunton Captain Coram removed to Boston, about the close of the seventeenth century, and engaged in Commerce. He became a ship—master, and acquired some property in following seas, especially in the then newly—discovered fisheries. By his intercourse with the colonies, at their different ports, he becamie well acquainted with their wants, and deeply concerned for their welfare; and though in a comparatively humble station, originated many noble plans for their benefit.

In 1704 he was very instrumental in planning and procuring an Act of Parliament, for encouraging the making of Tar in the Northern Colonies of British America, by a bounty to be paid on the importation thereof;, whereby not only a livelihood was afforded to thousands of families employed in that brauch of trade in North America, but above a million sterling was saved to the nation, which was heretofore obliged to buy all its Tar from Sweden, at a most exorbitant price, besides being imported in Swedish vessels.

In the year 1719, he was on board the ship ” Sea Flower,” on her passage to Hamburgh, when she 10

was stranded off Cuxhaven and plundered by the inhabitants of the district of her cargo. Coram, in endeavouring to preserve the property on board, was grossly ill—used by the pirates, who managed to overpower him and the rest of the authorities. In the affidavit relating to this outrage, he is described as ”of London, Mariner and Shipwright,” and the affidavit further sets forth, ”That he (Coram) having usually sold to his Majesty in the year past and at other times, quantities of naval stores from America, for the supply of his Majesty's navy, did about February last, design to visit his Majesty's German dominions to see what supplies of timber and other naval stores could be had from thence, fit for the navy royal.” By this incident in the life of Coram, we learn the nature of his transactions at this period, but it would seem that soon afterwards, having accumulated as much wealth as suited his moderate views, he retired from the sea service, and devoted himself for the remainder of his life to projects having for their object the public good. It was soon after this, that he turned his attention to the destitute state of the infant poor of the metropolisg, and engaged in his laudable design of establishing an Hospital for Foundlings.

Captain Coram was not a mere theorist. All his schemes were of a practical nature. He first made himself thoroughly master of his subject, and then set about convinceing those whose assistance he doemed necessary for their accomplishment. The dificulty he had to encounter was the want of that 11

energy of character in others, which was so remarkable in himself. This retarded the progress of many of the projeets he had set on foot for the benefit of mankind. The good, however, that he effected, is sufficiently substantial to hand his name down to the latest posterity, as the lover of his country and of her people. The celebrated Horace Walpole said of him that he was the ” honestest, the most disinterested, and the most knowing person about the plantations”* he ever talked with. The Colonial concerns of the country certainly had his special care.

It was at the solicitation of Captain Coram, that an Act of Parliament was obtained for taking off the prohibition on importing deal boards and fir timber from the Netherlands and Germany, on account of the King of Denmark having enhanced the prices of those commodities, by which means they immediately fell twenty per cent.

In the year 1732 he was appointed one of the trustees, by a charter from George IIL. for the settlement of Georgia, in the colonization of which province he took deep interest.

His next project related to Nova Scotia, and about the year 1735 he addressed the following Memorial to George II

* There is an honourable testimonial in favour of Captain Coram's character, in a letter from Mr. Horace Walpole, then ambassador at the Hague, to his brother, Sir Robert Walpole, dated the 18th April, 1735; where in a colonial matter of considerable importance, which is the subject of the letter, Mr. Walpole closes with these words: ”Lose no time in talking with Sir Charles Wager, Mr. Blanden, and one Coram, the honestest the most disinterested, and the most knowing person about the plantations I ever talked with.” Coxe's Life of Sir Robert Walpole, vol. III., page 243.

”To the King's Most Excellent Majesty in Councl.

”The Memorial of Thomas Coram, Gentleman, most humbly showeth,” That your memorialist having, through long experience in naval affairs, and by residing many years in your Majesty's plantations in America, observed, with attention, several matters and things which he conceives might be greatliy improved, for the honour and service of the Crown, and the increase of the trade, navigation, and wealth of this kingdom ; he, therefore, most humbly begs leave to represent to your Majesty,”That the coasts of your Majesty's province of Nova Scotia afford the best cod—fishing of any in the known parts of the world, and the land is well adapted for raising hemp, and other naval stores, for the better supplying this kingdom with the same : but the discouragements have hitherto been such as have deterred people from settling there, whereby the gaid province, for want of good inhabitants, is not so beneficial to this kingdom, nor so well secured to the Crown as it might be ; because it cannot be presumed the French inhabitants, who remain there by virtue of the treaty, whereby Nova Scotia was surrendered to Great Britain, anno 1710, being all papist, would be faithful to your Majesty's interest, in case of a war between Great Pritain and France,

”Your memorialist, therefore, most humbly conceives that it would be highly conducive to the interests of this kingdom to settle, without loss of 13

time, a competent number of industrious protestant families in the said province, which is the northern frontier of your Majesty's dominions in America, under a civil government to be established by your Majesty, conformable in all its branches, as near as may be to the constitution of England, which seems the most probable, if not the only means of peopleing this province, which experience shows could not be effected under the military government that hath been exercised there upward of twenty—four years past, and of giving effectual encouragement to the cod—fishery, that valuable branch of British commerce, which hath declined very much of late years, in proportion as the French have advanced therein.

” Your memorialist further begs leave to observe that the French are masters of the best salt in the .world for curing fish, whereas the English are obliged to have what salt they use from foreign dominions, which make it highly necessary to secure a perpetual supply of salt in your Majesty's dominions in America, that we may not depend on a precarious supply of that commodity from the dominions of other princes.
And your memorialist humbly conceives that the Island of Exuma, which is one of the Bahamas, would afford sufficient quantities of salt for all your Majesty's subjects in North America, provided Cat Island, another of the Bahamas, lying to windward of Exuma, was well settled and put in such a posture, as to be able to cover Exuma and protect the salt rakers from thbe depredations of the Spaniards of Baracoa (the settling of Cat Island would be otherwise vastly 14

advantageous to the Crown), and provided the unreasonable demand of the tenth of all salt raked there be abolished, for want of which encouragements, the salt ponds of Exuma have hitherto been useless to the public.

” To these purposes your memorialist humbly lays the annexed petition to your Majesty's feet, and begs leave to add that there are several honourable and worthy persons ready to accept and act in the trust therein described, if your Majesty shall be pleased to grant your Royal Letters Patent for that purpose.

” Wherefore he most humbly prays your Majesty to order that this memorial, together with the petition hereunto annexed, and whatever your memorialist shall have occasion further to offer, concerning the same, may be taken into consideration, and that your Majesty will be graciously pleased to do therein as your Majesty in your great wisdom and goodness shall seem proper.

” And he will ever pray, &c., &c.
”THomas Coram.”

Accompanying this memorial, was a petition from more than one hundred ”labouring handicraftsmen, whose respective trades and callings were overstocked by great numbers of artizans and workmen who resort from all parts of the metropolis, whereby the petitioners were unable to procure sufficient to maintain themselves and families.” They further set forth ” that to avoid extreme want, and escape the temptations which alway attend poverty, they were desirous of being settled securely in some of the plantations of 15

America.” The petitioners then state the advantages of the uncultivated tracts of land in the province of Nova Scotia, and pray that they may have the grant of a free passage thither, and when there be protected, their persons and properties by a civil government as near as may be to the constitution of England.,

Captain Coram's memorial was referred to the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, before whom he appeared on several occasions between the years 1735 and 1737, and both verbally and in writing submitted the most satisfactory and elaborate evidence of the propriety and expediency of his proposal, and the laws by which the colony should be maintained and governed, so as to draw the following approval from the Lords Commissioners, addressed to the Privy Council, dated 22nd April, 1737.

” The settlement of Nova Scotia with English inhabitants is of very great consequence to his Majesty's interest in America, and to the interest of this kingdom, from its situation with regard to the French, and from the fishery now carried on at Conso, and the several branches of naval stores that province is capable of producing, when once it shall be settled, as we have several times represented to his Majesty and to your lordships, particularly in our report of the 7th June, 1727 ; and therefore, we think it very much for his Majesty's service, to give all possible encouragement to any undertaking for this purpose, especially when attended with so great an appearance and probability of success as that of Mr. Coram's now under our consideration.” 16

Although the object which Captain Coram had in this matter was postponed for several years owing to political changes and hindrances, yet, before he died, he had the satisfaction of seeing the full development of his plansz, in regard to this now valuable colony.

What further relates to this great and good man, and of the different measures which were the objects of his laborious and useful life, cannot be communicated more appropriately than in the language of Dr. Brocklesby, his most intimate friend, who, soon after the death of Coram, thus delineated his character.

” The tribute of praise is due to every virtue—due in proportion to the excellence and extent of that virtue to which it is paid ; and consequently, public spirit, which is of all'virtues the most conducive to the good of society, deserves as high returns of public gratitude and respect as can possibly be given.
This is the rather incumbent on every community where conspicuous instances of this kind appear, because it is indeed the only reward adequate to tbeir merit, and the best method of propagating the example ; for what can so properly, or so potently exeite public spirit, as the sense of its begetting public love? The most illustrious of all good qualities ought certainly to be honoured with the noblest testimony of affection and esteem.

” There may, indeed, be some kind of restraint, gome check upon our zeal during the life of the party, from an apprehension that praise might be 17

mistaken for flattery, and that instead of promoting a general sense of the good man's virtue, it might be the means of exposing him to envy. But when a man is dead, praise is less suspected ; and those who would have listened very unwillingly to his commendations when living, will be the first to applaud and support it when he is no more. Whatever prejudices he had to combat, whatever opposition was formed to his designs, while he was busy in the pursuit, the man of public spirit is no sooner at rest from his labours and his life (which always end together), than the sentiments of the public are united on his behalf‚ and all attend with pleasure to the recital of those actions of the dead‚, which the living will find difficult to imitate.

” The late Captain Thomas Coram, now gone to his grave in a good old age, with the universal regret of the knowing and upright part of mankind, was a person whose merit and virtues were so extraordinary, exerted with such vigour, and with so great constancy for the benefit of society, that an attempt to raise some little monument to his memory cannot fail of being well received by the public, whose servant he was for upwards of forty years before his death, without any other wages than the honest satisfaction he felt in doing good and discharging his duty ; and will, at the same time, furnish a pleasing employment to one who loved him from the contemplation of his singular character, and for that rugged integrity which distinguished him exceedingly in the present age, and which would have done him no small honour

C 18

even in better times. An abler hand might have easily undertaken the task, but none could perform it with a better will.

”He was born about the year 1668, bred in the sea—service, and spent the first part of his life in the station of master of a vessel trading to our colonies, by which he gained a perfect acquaintance with that commerce which is of so great consequence, and produces so great profit to this nation. He acquired : very early, a sincere and warm attachment to the true interests of his country—had a real concern for them, and did not affect public spirit to cover any private views. His experience was his principal guide and from thence he learned to consider rational liberty, active industry, and unblemished probity, as the only principles upon which national prosperity could be built ; and to these, therefore, he gave his loudest voice and his most earnest endeavours. Free from all hypocrisy, he spoke what he thought with vehemence. But his zeal did not rest in words ; it was no less visible in his actions: so that not contented with wishing well to his country, and serving it faithfully in his private and particular capacity, he ventured to step out of the common road, and exerted himself in favour of many projects, from no other motive than their being of general utility.

”It may create some wonder, that without any other qualifications than these, Captain Coram should undertake to form schemes considerable for their extent, and very important in their intentions ; and still more wonderful that he should procure, from 19

men of great abilities and long acquaintance with business, an approbation of these schemes, and carry them at length into execution, by dint of unwearied application, and a perseverance that nothing could delay, disturb, or destroy. But this he certainly did, and that without any act but that of disclaiming itwithout any address beyond that of showing the advantages which the public would reap from his projects—he actually brought them, sooner or later, to bear, is a position so well supported by facts, that, though it is a little improbable, it must be believed.

”But if he wanted certain accomplishments—if he was deficient in some things which are thought necessary to form a suecessful solicitor, he had certain talents that supplied these defects. He had an honesty that, though it was a little rough, carried such apparent marks of its being genuine, that those who conversed with him but a little, lost all apprehensions of being deceived ; and if this did not give him an easier entrance, it certainly procured him an earlier confidence than would have resulted from # more polished behaviour. His arguments were nervous, though not nice—founded commonly upon facts, and the consequences that he drew‚, so closely connected with them, as to need no further proof than a fair explanation. When once he made an impression, he took care it should not wear out ; for he enforced it continually by the most pathetic remonstrances. In short, his logice was plain sense ; his eloquence, the natural language of the heart,

” When the possession of Nova Scotia was first 20

recovered to the crown of Great Britain by force of arms, and secured afterwards by a treaty of peace, Captain Coram very early saw the consequence that this province was of to the natural interest of this nation and her colonies. He was, therefore, very eager and very earnest to have it thoroughly settled, which, if once done, he very well knew, that the ad— vantages arising from agriculture, fishing, and trade, for which, from the richness of its soil, the convenience of its coasts, and the multiplicity of its harbours, it was admirably adapted, would make the value of it quickly known. In this, if he had not the good fortune which he expected and deserved, he was totally disappointed ; and, at the same time, had the pleasure to perceive that the more his notions were attended to, and the closer they were ezamined, the plainer and more probable they appeared; so that the utility of his scheme was acknowledged in a much greater degree than was, at that time of day, held expedient to carry it into execution.

”But as plans for the public service, well laid, though they sleep for a long time, seldom fail of waking at last, when, through a train of unlooked—for accidents and unexpected events, administrations are roused to attention, so, before his death, he had the satisfaction of seeing his old scheme revived, and this province, which had been so long neglected, owned and considered in that light in which he had long before placed it. — This must certainly have given him great consolation, more especially when he perceived that it was carried on under the auspice of a noble 21

person nearly allied to him in sentiment, and who had no0 other motive to that care and concern which he has shown for this rising colony but his affection to his country, and to whatever may contribute to strengthen her extensive empire, and secure the continuance of that prosperity which she derives from naval power, and settlements well placed and worthily directed.

” May such noble attempts meet with that success they deserve! May this country, so well situated, be thoroughly peopled and effectually cultivated! May protestants from every climate meet therein with a happy retreat from all kinds of oppression, and, by the help of their own industry, under the protection of the British Government, acquire a comfortable assistance, which they will never want spirit to defend !

” He was highly instrumental in promoting another good design—a design equally beneficial to Britain at home, and British subjects abroad, which coalition of interests is a thing always to be wished, and may, as in this case actually it was, be without much difficulty accomplished. The design here intended was the ‚ procuring a bounty upon naval stores imported from the colonies——a matter of vast advantage to the mother country, as it freed her from the necessity of dependence upon foreigners for commodities of essential consequence to her strength, and even to her safety, as it prevented the purchasing them with ready money, which was, in effect, saving so much treasure, and, as it exempted her from many difficulties which 22

she had often felt, and from the apprehension of which she could not otherwise be delivered—points, one would imagine, of so serious a nature, as, if once proposed, to command the strictest attention, and the truth of which, once known, from a close examination, never to be let slip out of memory. The design was likewise of infinite benefit to the colonies, because it afforded the means of enriching them by return from Britain, which, though nature furnished them with the commodities, they could not otherwise have had.
It removed impediments that had long subsisted—it opened a way for improvement, that though often wished for, could not but with the assistance of this method be attempted ; and it converted into value and use, lands and timber that would otherwise have produced nothing. To the inhabitants of the colonies, therefore, there could' be nothing more satisfactoryhardly anything so advantageous. But though this is saying a great deal, yet it is not all.

” As galutary and as profitable as this measure might be‚ considered in these distinct lights, yet its worth was heightened, its importance raised, and its utility demonstrated from another consideration, which was, its uniting the mother country and her daughters in those points of interest which ought to be eminently dear to both. At the same time that it freed Great Britain from depending upon foreigners, it made her sensibly feel the support. she received from her plantations ; and while the colonies, reaped a just return of profit from this assistance, they were, at the same time more closely connected, and taught to 23

discover the strong and inseparable ties by which they were bound to the mother country. These were the undeniable consequences of Captain Coram's project, and which will do eternal honour to his memory : they were the true and only motives to that ardour with which he pursued it. Enthusiasm was natural to his constitution ; but it was a political enthusiasm of the most noble kind—it was that of laying out all his faculties for the public good.
”But we must not imagine that this gentleman's knowledge of and love for the colonies carried him, in any degree, out of that path which a true Briton ought to tread. He loved the daughters dearly ; but he loved them as daughters, and therefore could not brook the least disrespect or disobedience in them towards their parent. The hatters, a very industrious and a very useful body of our manufacturers, thought themselves, with reason, aggrieved by the method taken, in some of the plantations, to interfere with their trade at foreign markets. Captain Coram no sooner heard of this complaint, than he examined it attentively, and impartially, and when he perceived that it was founded in right, he espoused it with spirit, he prosecuted it with diligence, and he obtained for that laborious and indefatigable people all the redress they could expect. They would have acknowledged this service by a grateful and handsome return; but Captain.Coram had a notion, that if a man's hands were not empty, they could not long be clean : he had a just sense of their gratitude, but did not care to have it expressed by any other present than that of 24

& hat, which he received as often as he had occasion, and, which in its size, spoke the good wishes of the makers in a very legible echaracter.

”In his private life, this gentleman showed the same probity, the same cheerfulness, the same frankness, the same warmth, and the same affection that he discovered in matters which respected the public ; so that, as a master and as a husband, he acted upon the same principles that he would have certainly shown if he had been raised to any conspicuous station of life. It is necessary to mention this, that the uniformity of his conduct may appear, which is the truest method of judging of men's real characters, so as to leave no sceruple or doubt upon the minds even of the most cautious enquirers. Beheld in this light, there could not well be conceived a man of greater simplieity of manners. What he thought, he spoke ; what he wished, he declared without hesitation, pursued without relaxation or disguise, and never considered obstacles any farther than to discover means to surmount them.

” While he lived in that part of this metropolis which is the common residence of seafaring people, he used to come early into the city, and return late, 1 according as his business required his presence ; and both these circumstances afforded him frequent occasions of seeing young children exposed, sometimes alive, sometimes dead, and sometimes dying, which affected him extremely. The reader cannot wonder at this; for a public—spirited man is always humane: and he who is inclined to wear out his life in rendering

2 — J 25

gervices to his fellow—subjects, will naturally have the most tender feeling for the sufferings of his fellowcreatures. This was precisely Mr. Coram's case: he saw this calamity in its proper light, and, like an honest and worthy man, thought it would do honour to the nation to show a public spirit of compassion for children thus deserted, through the indigence or ceruelty of their parents, and the rather because this was already done in other countries.

”He began, in respect to this design, as he did in all others, with making it the topic of his conversation, that he might learn the sentiments of other men, and from thence form some notion whether what he had in view was practicable. It was not long before he concluded in the affirmative, and, upon frequent trials, he found that there were numbers of all ranks of his sentiments, and not a few who thought it a shame, that a charity so obvious, so useful, and so necessary, should have been so long neglected. This pleased him extremely, and he undertook, with the greatest alacrity possible, to bring so noble, so beneficent, so charitable, so national, and so christian an undertaking to bear, by procuring for it the sanction of public authority. But, alas! he found his expectations strangely disappointed by an infinity of cross accidents that would certainly have wearied out the patience of a man whose resolution had not been equal to the vehemence of his temper. To this eircumstance Mr. Coram opposed an unrelenting perseverance, arising from a well—founded persuasion, that if the design was not carried into execution by him, it might for 26

& long time, perhaps for ever, remain abortive.

” This laudable, this invincible obstinacy, carried him through seventeen years of labour, which scarce any other man would have supported for seventeen months, if his own private fortune had been the basis of his pursuit. In this space, the opinion of the public had been frequently declared ou his side ; and several persons of sound sense and enlarged minds actually bequeathed considerable sums to this charity, when it should have a legal authority, which was the highest testimony they could possibly bear of their sgense of its utility. Our advocate for the helpless and the unborn left no stone unturned, let no opportunity slip, but continued to solicit where he had no interest, with as much ardour and anzxiety as if every deserted child had been his own, and the cause of the unfounded Hospital that of his family. His arguments moved some—the natural humanity of their own temper more—his firm but generous example most of all ; and even people of rank began to be ashamed to see a man's hair become grey in the course of a solicitation by which he was to get nothing. Those who did not enter far enough into the case to compassionate the unhappy infants for whom he was a guitor, could not help pitying him, or indeed forbear admiring a virtue so much more worthy of respect, considering the age in which it was exerted—a virtue which would have done honour to the most virtuous nations in the most virtuous periods—a virtue that made an impression even on such as thought it incomprehensible. But however it was, an impression 27

it made, and a general disposition appeared in favour of this charity. It is, however, doubtful what effect this would have had, or how soon that effect might have been produced, if it had any.

”But this good man, whose head was fertile in . expedients, bethought himself at last of applying to the ladies. He knew their nature, he knew their inAiuence, and soon found that he was in the right road.
They did not listen much to bis arguments, for the sweetness of their own tempers supplied a tenderness that rendered arguments unnccessary. They concurred with Mr. Coram in his design, and they concurred in his own way. They were earnest, assiduous, and sincere, and manifested a greater eagerness to do good than the most self—interested dare avow in pursuits upon their own account. This answered its end ; and by the help of these auziliaries, Mr. Coram was enabled to procure a charter, to prevent the most infamous of all murders, because the most unnatural, and which will supply thousands of useful subjects to the crown of Great Britain—a charter which did honour to the great seal, and spoke, in a literal sense, that prince whose stamp it bore—the father of his people, as he was before confessed in every other sense whatever.

”On Tuesday, November 20th, 1739, was held at Somerset House, the first general meeting of the nobility and gentry, appointed by his Majesty's Royal charter to be Governors and Guardians of the Hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children, to hear their charter read, 28

and to appoint their Secretary and a Committee.
Previous to the reading of the charter, Captain Coram, the petitioner for the charter, addressed his Grace the Duke of Bedford, the President, in the

following manner :” 'My Lord Duke of Bedford,

'It is with inexpressible pleasure I now present your Grace, at the head of this noble and honourable corporation, with his Majesty's royal charter, for establishing an Hospital—for exposed children, free of all expense, through the assistance of some com| passionate great ladies, and other good persons.

'I can, my lord, sincerely aver, that nothing would have induced me to embark in a design so full of difficulties and discouragements, but a zeal for thé gervice of his Majesty, in preserving the lives of great numbers of his innocent subjects.

© The long and melancholy experience of this nation 7 has too demonstrably shewn, with what barbarity tender infants have been exposed and destroyed, for want of proper means of preventing the disgrace, and succouring the necessitries of their parents.

'The charter will disclose the extensive nature and end of this Charity, in much stronger terms than I can possibly pretend to describe them, so that I have only to thank your Grace and many other noble personages, for all that favourable protection which hath given life and spirit to my endeavours.

'My Lord, although my declining years will not permit me to hope seeing the full accomplishment of 29

my wishes, yet I can now rest satisfied, and it is what I esteem an ample reward of more than seventeen years expensive labour and steady application, that I see your Grace at the head of this charitable trust, assisted by so many noble and honourable Governors.

'Under such powerful influences and directions, I am confident of the final success of my endeavours, and that the public will one day reap the happy and lasting fruits of your Grace's and this Corporation's measures, and as long as my life and poor abilities endure, I shall not abate of my zealous wishes and most active services for the good and prosperity of this truly noble and honourable Corporation.'

” After the charter was read, Dr. Mead, in the most pathetic manner, set forth the necessity of such an .
Hospital, and the vast advantages that must accrue \ to the nation by this useful establishment, which was received with universal approbation, because nobody could entertain the least doubt of the truth or certainty of what the Doctor said.

” At a subsequent Court, the same learned person moved, that the thanks of the Corporation might be given to Mr. Thomas Coram, for his indefatigable and successful applications in favour of this charity, which otherwise would have wanted a legal foundation. It may be easily supposed, that the good old man was not insensible on receiving the only reward of which his labours were capable. But he was just, as well as generous, and would not take more to himself than he deserved. He therefore desired that the thanks of the Corporation might be likewise given 30 to the ladies,* through whose assistance his own endeavours became effectual, and he was accordingly empowered to return them the thanks of that honourable body, which was an additional pleasure to a mind sincere and grateful like his.

” Time and accidents could make but little alteration in his temper. The motives from which he first espoused this charity, kept him always attached to its interests ; he often visited the Hospital, and saw the children rescued from misery by his care and compassion, with as much pleasure and tenderness as if they had been his own, as indeed in some sense they were. He beheld the lists of benefactors with more pleasure than a miser regards those of his securities.
He had the same delight in perceiving the quick progress of this excellent establishment, as a man of another turn would have felt from the improvement of his own estate. This was peculiar to his character —this was the ruling passion of his mind—this was the elixir that kept him from feeling the frowns of fortune in the winter of his age. Wrapt in that cloak of public spirit, which, though womn for so many years, never grew threadbare, he heard those storms whistle around him, unmoved, which would have



* Even in the case of the ”ladies” he had sometimes to encounter difficultios. Attached to & memorial addressed ”To H.R.H. the Princess Amelia,” now lodged at the Hospital, is the following note:©On Innocents' Day, the 28th of December, 1737, I went to St. James's Palace to present this petition, having been advised first to address the lady of the bedchamber in waiting to introduce it. But the Lady Isabella Finch, who was the lady in waiting, gave moe very rough words, and bid me gone with my petition, which I did, without opportunity of presenting it,” 31

frighted a person of ordinary courage out of his wits.

” For the truth is, honest reader, and I must not conceal it, that this worthy man, who could feel so much for others, felt but little for himsaelf. After he lost his wife, the only loss for which he ever showed much regret, he was so attentive to public affairs, as to be a little too careless of his own, insomuch, that he might have known even this evil, which no man could have known, while it was in his power to relieve.
But his friend Mr. Gideon, who loved him for loving the public, interposed, and obtained a subscription for his comfortable support, towards which, His Royal Highness the late Prince of Wales subscribed twenty guineas per annum, and paid it with as much punctuality as any of the rest of the subscribers, who were most of them merchants; and upon this friendly assistance which he lived to want, but not to ask, he subsisted for some time, which gave him an opportunity to form new schemes of the zame kind with those he had executed already ; schemes full of goodness, and which had a tendency to spread the influence of Britain, and to expand the nation's glory in a like degree. ” The reader may be surprised—and indeed his gurprise will be very excusable—that a person whose worth and services were so well known should be left to such distress, and that in a country where the public pays so much to place—men, no notice should be taken of a man who deserved a place so well as Mr. Coram did. But first of all it must be considered, that though the public discharge the expense of many, 32

yet their choice is asked in filling very fow places.
Our hero had, indeed, very great qualities, but they were far from being well turned for anything of this kind. He who had spent his life in soliciting for others, could not speak a word for himself. It is, therefore, no wonder that he was not provided for.
Dumb men are not fit for places. But if the reader enquires why he did not speak, the answer may not be difficult. Men of true public spirit, are of all others, the most ashamed to ask private favours. In others it would be pride, in them it is the effect of principle. It may be said, then, a place should have been given him. To this there can be no reply ; yet, perhaps, it may be some excuse to say, that, while a multitude of claims are put in for every place, we have no reason to be amazed, that a man who would never ask should always be forgot.

”But Providence provided for him, and he had a comfortable subsistence to the last, by a method that he did not‚, nor indeed could take amiss. He was maintained by the voluntary subseription* of men of public spirit ; this was an honour to them, and an honour to him. Had his distress been generally known, he might no doubt, have been more amply



* On Dr. Brocklesby applying to Captain Coram, to know whether a subscription being opened for his benefit would not offend him, he received this noble answer :—” I have not wasted the little wealth of which I was formerly possessed in self—indulgence and vain expenses, and am not ashamed to confess that, in this my old age, I am poor.”

Upon the death of Coram, this pension was continued to poor old Leve« ridge, for whose volume of songs Hogarth had, in 1727, engraved a titlepage and frontispiece, and who, at the age of ninety, had scarcely an3 other prospect than that of a parish subsistence.—John Ireland., 34

provided for; but this was what he did not want, and what he would never seek. He was content with a little—pleased with being his own master, and with having the liberty to employ his thoughts, to the end of his life, in the same manner that they had been employed from the beginning—in contriving for the public benefit ; for whatever his circumstances were, his heart could never be narrow.

”His last design, now left an orphan to the public care, which it well deserves, was a scheme for uniting the Indians in North America more closely to the British interest, by an establishment for the education of Indian girls. This is, indeed, a very political contrivance ; for if the girls be brought up in Christian principles, we have just grounds to hope—indeed, we have no reason to doubt—that the Indian children, of both sexes, in the next generation, will be brought up Christians, This would be a refined stroke of policy ; for he is the wisest and ablest of all politicians who, by promoting the glory of God, interests the Divine Providence in extending the power of any nation.
We know in how wonderful a manner the gospel was propagated, and we may confidently expect, that when this is sincerely the aim of any government, the same assistance will not be wanting: for whatever men may do, the great Author of all things never alters his maxims, and to follow them is the most infallible method of securing, might we not say commanding, success. May this charitable and pious purpose, in which he lived long enough to make some progress, be completed in virtue of his proposal ; and

D 34

let the benighted Indians in America join with the deserted Foundlings in Britain in blessing the memory of this worthy man, by which a provision was made that they should come to the knowledge of truth, and of the means of making themselves happy here by their industry, and by their piety hereafter.

”If it had been in our power to have taken notice of all the other instances he gave of beneficence, fortitude, and love for society, which are the true virtues of a patriot, this little work would swell to a volume. What is here said, therefore, must be regarded as an imperfect and hasty sketch of his character, which however may, from its intention, rather than performance, be agreeable to his friends, and may perhaps serve, in some measure, to excite in others a desire of imitating so amiable an example ; for who that has any respect for virtue, any appetite to laudable and spotless fame—the noblest purchase that human industry can make—can be insensible to that just and general concern which the best and worthiest men in this metropolis have shown for the loss of Captain Coram, or that readiness with which they have expressed their approbation of his conduct, and the voluntary testimonies they have given to his merit and services. These are things that will affect those who are above the common pursuits of the world, who seek not either tinsel grandeur or the embarrassment of riches, but yet are far from leading @ life of indolence, or disclaiming all pretensions to that glory which is so properly the reward of virtue, that it can attend to nothing else.
35

” This singular and memorable man exchanged this life for a better, and passed from doing to enjoying good, on Friday, March 29th, 1751, in the four—score and fourth year of his age, making it his last request, that his corpse might be interred in the Chapel of the Foundling Hospital, which shows he had that excellent foundation at his heart, when all things that regarded this world besides were out of his thoughts—a eircumstance that demonstrates the steadiness of his affection, and the happiness he had of what he had done for this place, when he was on the point of going where pious and charitable actions afford the highest recommendations—where his merit in that and other respects will be fully known and fully rewarded.

”Accordingly, on Wednesday, the 3rd of April, agreeable to his request, his remains were interred in the Chapel of this Hospital, his pall supported by six, and his funeral attended by a great number of the honourable and worthy persons who are Governors of this useful charity, and who manifested upon this melancholy occasion, that sincere regard for the deceased, and the pleasure they took in paying this deserved respect to his memory—a ceremony which, joined to the high reputation and numerous acquaintance of the deceased, could not have failed of attracting abundance of public—spirited persons, desirous of giving this last mark of their esteem for a man of Mr. Coram's worth, and who, through the progress of a long life, had shown himself a laudable as well as active member of society.

”But the concourse was much increased, and the 36

solemnity of the funeral greatiy heightened, by the voluntary appearance of the choir of &St. Paul's Cathedral, who were at the Hospital, ready in their surplices to receive the body, and who performed, with the universal approbation of a crowded and distinguished audience, a grave and noble piece of music, suitäble to the sad occasion, and which, with the genuine testimonies of sorrow, not to be suppressed, did all the honour to this good man that even the piety and affection of his friends could expect, The Governors of the Hospital have it also in their intention to raise a suitable monument, though indeed, the Hospital itself may be so styled, that posterity may be the better acquainted with his virtues, and their gratitude.

”Let me be permitted to conclude, with what may add some degree of merit to this little piece, deficient enough in other respects, the words made use of by a friend of his, in the paragraph which gave the first hint to tbis performance, and which is, indeed, a true character of Mr. Thomas Coram in a very fow words : —”'That when others are remembered by titles and adulations, his shall be nobler fame to have lived above the fear of everything but an unworthy action.'” 37

The following Inseription, cut in stone, is placed in the southern arcade of the Chapel :«”CAPTAIN THOMA8 CORAM,

whose name will never want a monument so long as this Hospital shall subeist, was born in the year 1668 ; a man eminent in the most eminent virtue, the love of mankind ; little attentive to his private fortune, and refusing many opportunities of increasing it, his time and thoughts were continually employed in endeavours to promote the public happiness, both in this kingdom and elsewhere ; particularly in the Colonies of North America; and his endeavours were many times crowned with the desired success.
His unwearied solicitation, for above seventeen years together (which would have baffied the patience and industry of any man less sealous in doing good), and his application to persons of distinction, of both sexes, obtained at length the Charter of the Incorporation (bearing date the 17th of October, 1739), for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children, by which many thousands of lives may be preserved to the public, and employed in m frugal and honest course of industry.
He died the 29th March, 1751, in the 84th year of his age; poor in worldiy estate, rich in good works: and was buried at his own desire, in the Vault underneath this Chapel (the first there deposited) at the east end thereof, many of the Governors and other gentlemen attending the funeral to do honour to his memory.

Reader, Thy actions will show whether thou art sincere in the praises thou may'st bestow on him ; and if thou hast virtue enough to commend his virtues, forget not to add also the intimation of them.” There is in front of the Hospital a fine Statue of the Founder,

EARLY ADMISSION OF CHILDREN,

The first admission of Children took place in 1741, under the following advertisement ;”To—morrow, at eight o'clock in the evening, this house will be opened for the reception of twenty children, under the following regulations :” No child exceeding the age of two months will be taken in, nor such as have the evil, leprosy, or disease of the like nature, whereby the health of the other children may be endangered; for the discovery whereof every child is to be inspected as soon as it is brought, and the person who brings it is to come in at the outward door and ring a bell at the inward door, and not go away. until the child is returned or notice given of its reception; but no questions whatever will be asked of any person who brings a child, nor shall any servant of the house presume to endeavour to discover who such person is, on pain of being discharged.

”All persons who bring children are requested to affix on each child some particular writing, or other ° distinguishing mark or token, so that the children may be known hereafter if necessary.”

These receptions of children took place occasionally in the same manner, and were necessarily regulated by the funds of the Hospital, which being derived from private subscriptions and legacies of benevolent individuals only, were of course limited.

As the Hospital became more generally known, it 39

will readily be supposed that the applications for

admission greatiy increased, so that therewem__.

frequently one hundred women at n at the door. when

twenty—Wren only could be received. This gave—rise to the disgraceful scene of women serambling and

fighting to get to the door, that they might be of the]

fortunate few to reap the benefit of the Asylum. ‚—To obviate this evil a new method was adopted, by

which all women bringing children were admitted into

the court—room, and there zat on benches, with strict

orders not to stir from their seats. Then, as many

white balls as there were children to be taken in, with

five red balls for every twenty children to be received,

and so in proportion for any greater or less number :

and as many black balls, as with the white and red,

were equal to the number of women present, were put

into a bag or box, which was handed round to the

women ; each woman who drew a white ball was sent „\

with her child to the inspecting—room, that it might \o’*

undergo the usual examination. Every woman who

drew a black ball was immediately turned out of the

house with her infant ; and every woman who drew a

red ball was taken, with her child, into another room,

there to remain until the examination of the children

For whom white balls were drawn was ended, and if, on

such examination, any of those children were rejected,

for reasons stated in the public notice, ballots were

taken, after a similar manner for filling up the vacancies,

till the whole number was completed. This plan, it is

true, prevented the disgraceful scenes described; but a

charity so unguardedly dispensed as to the selection of

2 40

its objects, could not but open the door to fraud and abuse of the worst description. We know that no human institution, however cautiously managed, can be wholly free from abuse ; some daring Clodius will always be found to pollute the mysteries, let the house be ever so carefully watched. If this be true in ordinary cases, surely it must have required more than common caution in setting on foot an asylum, the opening of which, if not carefully effected, would let looge as many evils as ever issued from Pandora's box.
This was evidently felt by Captain Coram himself, who, in the memorial which he presented to George the Second, as a recommendation of his design, throws out the cautionary suggestion,—that its success could only be insured, ”provided due and proper care be taken for setting on foot so necessary an establishment.” He no sooner found, therefore, that the managers were acting upon a principle which furnished no guarantee for the effectual operation of the charity, namely,receiving children without establishing any test by which the merits of each case could be ascertained, than he opposed their proceedings ; but after repeated admonition, finding his advice disregarded by the majority of the Committee, he left the management of the Institution altogether in their hands.*

The system above referred to continued for a period



* Of the particular cause of ding-semen} between Captain Coram and the managing Committee there is no record. The following extract from the will of Anthony Allen, Esq., dated 1753, shows, however, that the Founder was supported in his objections to their proceedings by one, at least, of his friends :

” And whereas many years before the obtaining the royal charter for the 41

of fifteen years, viz. :—from 1741 to 1756, during which, 1384 children were received, or, upon an average, ninety—two annually.

The managers, however, looked forward all along to the time when they should be able to open their Hospital upon the most unrestricted plan, and many were the abortive schemes suggested for the acquirement of wealth to enable them to do so; but it was obvious, that no power or means, except Parliamentary, could be devised for effectually meeting the object. To Parliament, thereforg, the Governors appealed, having previously ascertained that George the Second had a good feeling towards their design. The following resolutions of the House of Commons, of the 6th April, 1756, sufficiently prove the success with which the application was attended ;”That the enabling the Hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children to receive all the children that shall — be offered, is the only method to render that charitable institution of lasting and general utility.

Hospital for exposed and deserted young children, I did, at the instance of that indefatigable schemist, Captain Thomas Coram, really intend some considerable benefaction towards carrying on so good a project, and did encourage the concurrence of other liberal benefactors, till some of the acting Governors and Guardians of the said Hospital went counter to our judgments and proposal pressed upon them by the said Coram, on several occasions, which made moe withhold my hand, saving the sum of sixteen guineas I advanced as necessity urged, from time to time, towards the immediate subsistence of the said Mr. Coram, who had exhausted his whole substance in soliciting that charter during about seventeen years, never meeting any relief from the said Hospital, I now will that £200, besides the said £16 16s. so paid, be given to the use of the said Hospital, within two years after my decease, in lieu of all claims and pretengions the said Hospital may make on that gcore,” 42

” That to render the said Hospital of lasting and general utility, the assistance of Parliament is necessary.

”That to render the said Hospital of general utility and effect, it should be enabled to appoint proper places in all counties, ridings, or divisions of this kingdom, for the reception of all exposed and deserted young children.”

Added to these resolutions, a guarantee was given by Parliament that it would provide the means, by liberal grants of money, to enable the Governors to carry out this extensive scheme of charity.

A basket was accordingly hung outside of the gates of the Hospital, and an advertisement publicly

! announced, that all children under the age of two {_months, tendered for admission, would be received.
— In pursuance of which, on the 2nd June, 1756, being the first day of general reception, 117 children i were given up to the fostering care of the state !*

* ” I well remember the transaction of the first general taking—in—day, the Znd of June, when we received 117 children. The whole month produced 425, all of them supposed not to be above two months old; for that was the age limited. The next year (1757) £30,000 was voted, and we set out by extending the age to six months. From this period the age was extended to twelve months, not with a desire to receive more children than before, but in order to let people understand, that, if they would take care of their children in the most dangerous part of life, they might be received afterwards, hereby acknowledging what indeed is very obvious, that there was much less danger at the mother's own breast, than at any other woman's. This demonstrated the zeal of the Governors for the cause of humanity and the welfare of the public; and it seemed to be very right, except that the common people in the country seeing us add four months to the two, and then six months to make up twelve, might ‚conceive, that we meant to take all their éhildren off their hands,”—Jonas Hanway.
43

Though the Governors of the charity, in anticipation of parochial interference, had armed themselves with the special power of the law for their protection, yet they discovered that no authority, however great, could prevent parish officers from emptying their workhouses of the infant poor, and transferring them to this general sanctuary provided by government. Had they stopped here, the morality of their conduct would not, perhaps, have been questioned ; but it was the frequent practice of these daring authorities, sometimes in conjunction with the brutal father, to rob the poor mother of her new—born infant wbilst she was in a state of helplessness from the effects of her recent confinement, and to convey it to the Hospital, that they might be rid of the burden of maintaining it. The scenes which daily occurred at the asylum from this ceircumstance, would have moved the stoutest heart.

The managers did all they could to prevent this infamous practice, by prosecuting the delinquents, but the motive was too strong to be put down ; it continued in spite of their efforts.

When a Foundling Hospital was established in Paris, in the year 1640, its objects were limited to the children found exposed in that city, and its suburbs; and it was understood by those who furthered a similar design in this country, that its operations would, in the same manner, be confined to London and its environs.
But benefits so tempting being irresistible to persons

—in country towns, they were determined to share with the good people of London, a privilege which they considered common to all. ” There is set up in our 44

Corporation” (writes a correspondent from a town three hundred miles distant, in one of the chronicles of the day), a new and uncommon trade, namely, the conveying children to the Foundling Hospital. The person employed in this trade is a woman of notoriously :bad character. She undertakes the carrying of these ‚children at so much per head. She has, I am told, / made one trip already ; and is now set upon her journey with two of her daughters, each with a child on her : back.” The writer then very properly suggests that it ought to be ascertained ”whether or not these poor infants do really arrive at their destination, or what becomes of them.” That such an inquiry was necessary there is no doubt ;—the sequel will prove it.

At Monmouth, a person was tried for the murder of his child, which was found drowned with a stone about its neck! when the prisoner proved that he delivered it to a travelling tinker, who received a guinea from him to carry it to the Hospital. Nay, it was publicly asserted in the House of Commons,' that one man who had the charge of five infants in baskets, happened in his journey to get intozxicated, and lay all night asleep on a common ; and in the morning he found three of five children he had in charge actually dead! Also, that of eight infants brought out of the country at one time in a waggon, seven died before it reached London : the surviving child owing its life to the solicitude of its mother ; who rather than commit it alone to the carrier, followed the waggon on foot, occasionally affording her infant tho nourishment it required,

k 45

It was further stated that a man on horseback, going to London with luggage in two panniers, was overtaken at Highgate, and being asked what he had in his panniers, answered, ”I have two children in each: I brought them from Yorkshire for the Foundling Hospital, and used to have eight guineas a trip; but lately another man has set up against me, which has lowered my price.”

This practice of transporting children from remote towns was condemned by a distinct resolution of the House of Commons, and a Bill was ordered to be brought in to prevent it; but this Bill was never prosented, so that the parish officers and others still, continued to carry on their illicit trade, by delivering| children to vagrants, who, for a small snm of money, undertook the task of conveying them to the Hospital,, although they were in no condition to take care of; them, whereby numbers perished for want, or were otherwise destroyed ; and even in cases where children were really left at the Hospital. the barbarous wretches who had the conveying of them, not content with the gratuity they received, stript the poor infants of their clothing into the bargain, leaving them naked in the basket at the Hospital gate.*

A system so void of all order and discretion, must necessarily have occasioned many difficulties : for



* The following is a strong instance of the vicissitudes of life :—Some years since, an agod Banker in the north of England, received into the Hospital at the above period, was desirous of becoming acquainted with his .
origin, when, all the information afforded by the books of the establishment was, that hoe was put into a basket at the gate naked.
46

instance, it frequently happened, that persons who sent their children to the Hospital, having nothing to prove their reception, were suspected, or, if not suspected, where charged by their malevolent neighbours with destroying them, and were consequently cited before a magistrate of the district to shew to the contrary. This they could only do by procuring an examination of the Hospital registers ; and the Governors were frequently called upon for certificates of the fact, before the party could be released. This inconvenience was, however, afterwards obviated, by the practice of giving a billet to each person who brought a child, acknowledging its reception.

But the dificulty which preserted itself paramount to all others, related to the manner in which so great a number of children was to be reared. In the first year of this indiscriminate admission, the number received was 3,296 ; in the second year, 4,085 ; in the third, 4,229 ; and during less than ten months of the fourth year (after which the system of indisceriminate reception was abolished). 3,324. Thus, in this short period, no less than 14,934 infants were cast on the compassionate protection of the public! It necessarily became a question how the lives of this army of infants could be best preserved; and the Governors not being able to settle this point among themselves, addressed certain queries to the College of Physicians, which were promptly answered, by recommending a course of treatment consonant to nature and common sense !
Children dJdeprived as these were of their natural aliment, required more than usual watchfulness ; and 47

although, on a small scale, the providing a number of healthy wet—nurses as substitutes for the mothers of infants would have been an easy task, yet, when they arrived in numbers so considerable, the Governors found that the object they had in view must necessarily fail from its very magnitude.

It has been truly said, that the frail tenure by which an infant holds its life, will not allow of a remitted attention even for a fow hours : who, therefore, will be surprised, after hearing under what circumstances most of these poor children were left at the Hospital gate, that, instead of being a protection to the living, the institution became, as it were, a charnel—house for the dead ! It is a notorious fact, that many of the infants received at the gate, did not live to be carried into the wards of the building ; and from the impossibility of procuring a sufficient number of proper nurses, the ”emaciated and diseased state in which many of these children were brought to the Hospital, and the malconduct of some of those to whose care they were committed (notwithstanding these nurses were under thesuperintendence of certain ladies—sistersof charity), the deaths amongst them were so frequent, that of the 14,934 received, only 4400 lived to be apprenticed out, being a mortality of more than seventy per cent.
Thus was the institution (conducted on a plan so wil and chimerical, and so widely different from its original design), found to be diseased in its very vitals. _ The avowed object of saving life was frustrated by a variety of contingent circumstances ; and the permanent and two—fold benefit of which it was intended to have been 48

the instrument, under the regulations contemplated by the Founder, was set aside by a system of fraud and abuse which entailed on the public an immense annual expenditure,* without even one good result. To establish a market for vice to carry on her profligate trade without let or hindranco ; to arrest the first step towards repentance of one yet in the infancy of erime, by pointing out the way in which she might perpetuate her guilt with impunity ; to break the beautiful chain of the affections which characterizes mankind as social beings, by giving general license to parents to desert their offspring, upon the barbarous plea that they cannot easily maintain them ; to wink as it were, at fraud, by showing how designing persons might dispose of children entrusted to their guardianship, and prevent a discovery of their guilty acts : these were zsome of the evils which were realised in the early proceedings of the Governors, from want of attention to the cautionary suggestion of the Founder, to ” take due and proper care in setting on foot so necessary an establishment.”

But the state of things described could not possibly



* The total expense was about £500,000! Several propositions were made for ridding the country of the burthen, and amongst them the following:—” His Majesty having recommended the case of the Foundling Hospital to the House of Commons which cheefully granted £40,000, for the support of that charity, the growing annual expense of it appeared worthy of further consideration, and leave was granted to bring in & bill for obliging all the parishes of England and Wales to keep registers of all their deaths, births, and marriages, that from these a fund might be raised towards the support of the said (Hospital. The bill was accordingly prepared by a committee appointed for the purpose, but before the House could take the report into consideration, the Parliament was prorogued.”'Smollett.
49

last long, except in a community lost to all decency and order. No sooner, therefore, did those who had promoted'a system fraught with so much mischief, discover the error they had committed, than they wished to retrace their steps :—the moralist ‚enlisted his pen in a cause which he found was endangered by its continuance, and mercy stepped forward to arrest the destroying hand of death, to whose vengeance so many infants had been doomed, under the sganction of this unwise administration of the charity ; and at length Parliament, which, by its inadvertence, had promoted the evil, annulled its sanction thereto, by declaring—That the indiscriminate admission of all children under a certain age into the Hospital, had been attended with many evil consequences, and that it be discontinued.

After the House of Commons had passed the regolution which annulled the practice of receiving children in such an unguarded and indisceriminate manner, the Governors were left to adopt what they conceived to be the views of the Founder, and to place the Institution upon that basis of prudential charity on which it now stands.

Tokens.—1t will be seen, that one of the regulations at the outset was, that persons leaving children should ”affix on them some particular writing, or other distinguishing mark or token.” These tokens are of different classes ;1st.—Coins of various periods of English history, and many foreign, almost invariably of silver or copper.
®

 50

On some of them the name and date of the birth of the child is engraved, and there are besides several metal devices.

Znd.—Trinkets, &c., of various kinds.

3rd.—Pieces of printed cotton and specimens of ribbon.
This class of token is the most common of the whole.

The miscellaneous tokens consist of monograms, children's caps, and here and there a child's caul.

In 1757, a lottery ticket was given in with a child, but whether it turned up a prize or a blank is not recorded.

In some instances the means of identity are in the form of scraps, such as the following. They are copied litterally.

” Beatus est qui intelligit super Egenum et pauperem ; tempore mali liberabit eum Jehota, Nam pater meus et mater mea derelinquunt me, sed Jehova recipiet me.”



” Valo, forte in gsternum vale, O chara Soboles inter suspiria lachrymasque Parentum, Pauperie non indecora urgente, brachiis, curß, humanitati hujus Hospitii nuno dedita.”



” Marcus Brutus Cromwell, natus erat premio die Decembris A.D., 1757, il est marque avec un peu de rouge dans le coin de son oiel gauche.”

” Necessitas non habet Leges.”

* Nec amicus, nec inimicus.”



” D'Bapientia Veni Lumen Cordium.”

 51 * Suoccessus attendre tuet.”



” 8i tibi cura mei, Sit tibi cura tui.”



” 8i splacit, nomen esto hujus puellalg@—”



” Publica Cura prodis.”

In other cases the token is in the character of verse or rhyme, for instance ;”Go gentle babe, thy fature life be spent In virtuous purity, and calm content; Life's sunshine bless thee, and no anzious care 8it on thy brow, and draw the falling tear ; Thy country's grateful servant may'st thou prove And all thy life be happiness and love.”

” Pray use me well, and you shall find My father will not prove unkind Unto that nurse who's my protector, Because he is a benefactor.”'



” Pity the offspring of a Youthful pair, Whom folly taught, and Pleasure did Ensnare ; Let the poor Babe, its parents fault atone Stand you its friend, or else it is undone!



” Hard is my lot in deep distress

To have no help where most should find.

”By any means we cannot her relieve ; So gracious God, we beg thou wilt forgive, This fault of ours, and pity on her take ; And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake.”

At this period, the station in life of the parties availing themselves of the charity could only be surmised by the quality of the garments in which the children were dressed, the particulars of which were faithfully recorded ; the following being a sample viz :”1741,—A male child, about two months old, with white dimity sleeves, lined with white, and tied with red ribbon.”

” A female child, aged about six weeks, with a blue figured ribbon, and purple and white printed linen sleeves, turned up with red and white.” 58

” A male child, about a fortnight old, very neatly dressed ; a fine holland cap, with a cambric border, white corded dimity sleeves, the shirt ruffled with cambrie.” ” A male child, a week old ; a holland cap, with a

plain border, edged biggin and forehead—cloth, diaper bib, striped and flowered dimity mantle, and another holland one; India dimity sleeves, turned up with stitched holland, damask waistcoat, holland ruffled shirt.” Some of the children were avowed by the parties leaving them to be legitimate, and many are so by inference, being born in Lying—in Charities intended for married women only.

Sometimes the recording clerk was rather laconic and quaint in his descriptions : for instance, of one of the children, he says, it had

” A paper on the breastClout on the head.””



Children received with Money.—After Parliament (frightened by the spirit of evil itself had raised) had deserted the charity, the Governors were left to pursue, once more, their own course, and to adapt, if they thought fit, its administration to the more immediate objects of the Founder. This they were evidently desirous of doing, but the extravagancies caused by the ”nationality” of their Institution for the period alluded to had emptied the Exchequer of the Hospital, and the evils of the system had so offended the public, that 54

much of the individual support which it previously received from charitable persons was withdrawn.

The ”poverty,” perhaps, not the ”will” of the acting Governors, led them into an error of another kind, namely—aÜ resolution to receive children with money, in addition to such other objects as the funds of the Hospital might enable them to maintain. It is a fact much to be regretted, that for many years children wore mystenously received on payment of £100, without a knowledge of‚ or any clue being given to the parents from whom they sprang‘ e abuses whic

”might, and no doubt did, arise from this system, are so

obvious as to need no comment. It is due, however, to the Governors to say, that immediately after the funds of the charity had assumed & healthier state, they abolished altogether this more than questionable practice. At a court of Governors, held on the 21&t January, 1801, there being present several eminent lawyers, including Mr. (afterwards Baron) Garrow, and Sir Thomas Plumer (subsequently Master of the Rolls), it was resolved to rescind the obnozxious bye—law which originated so objectionable a system., The truth is, the matter was about to be brought to a legal issue, from the following circumstance :—The mother of a child which had been received under this rule, although a consenting party to the separation, afterwards repented, and, having discovered the residence of the nurse with whom it was placed in the country, practised.upon her an artifice by which she obtained possession of the child, and refused to relinquish her right. The Governors, feeling themselves under an obligation to 55

reclaim the child by exercising the powers which they conceived to be vested in them, took a high legal opinion, when they were advised that, owing to their departure in this respect from the spirit and letter of their charter, and the Act of Parliament confirming it, , they had no chance of being protected in a court of .
law. From this time, therefore, namely January, 1801, no child has been received into the Hospital, either directly or indirectly, with any sum of money, large or small. °

The present practice.—The present mode of admitting children has prevailed for more than sixty years, without those variations of principle and practice which characterized previous periods of the History of the Hospital. It cannot be better set forth than in the language of a report made to Parliament in 1836, by a commission appointed to enquire into the larger charities of London :— i

” The present practice of the Governors is to decide ;— ‚ each application for the admission of children on its ° own merits. There are, however, certain preliminary conditions required, the absence of any one of which is fatal to the petitioner's application, and subjects it to instant rejection, except in very peculiar cases. Thus it is required,

” 1. That the child shall be illegitimate, except the father be a soldier or sailor killed in the service of his country.*



* No body of men could have been influenced by more noble and patriotic feelings on different occasions than the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, In 1761, during the War in Germany, also during the Continental war in 1794, 56

”2. That the child be bomn, and its age under twelve months.

” 3. That the petitioner shall have borne a good character previous to her misfortune or delivery.

” 4. That the father shall have deserted his offspring, and be not forthcoming, that is, not to be found, or compellable to maintain his child.

”Bupposing, therefore, that it appears by the petition, and the petitioner's examination,* that the claim for admission is advanced in respect of an illegitimate child, of a hitherto respectable parent, not twelve months old, whose father has deserted it and is not forthcoming, and whose birth has not been taken cognizance of by any parish authorities, the petitioner is considered to have established a case for enquiry ; and the ” Enquirer ” is directed to obtain information, both as to these and as to other circumstances in the case now to be stated, which differ from those abovementioned in this respect, that none are absolutely required, and that they are all taken into consideration by the Governors, and influence their estimate of the merits of each application, according to the degree only in which they prevail in the individual one under consideration.

”Thus the petitioner's child acquires a stronger



and on the occasion of the battle of Waterloo, they freely opened their gates to the necessitous children of those who had fallen in the service of their country. Illegitimate children are now the sole objects of the Charity.

* ”No one can blame the total change of the plan, which for the last sixty years has been made, with whatever view, by adopting the rule to admit no child whose mother does not appear to be examined.”—Lord Brougham's Letter to Sir Samuel Romtlly on Charities, 57 claim to admission, according to the degree in which it appears” 1. That the petitioner is poor, and has no relations able or willing to maintain her child.

”2. That her delivery and shame are known to few persons, being either her relations or inmates of the house in which the circumstances occurred.

”3. That in the event of the child being received, the petitioner has a prospect of preserving her station in society, and obtaining by her own exertions an honest livelihood.

”The most meritorious case, therefore, would be one _ in which a young woman, having no means of subsistence, except those derived from her own labour, and having no opulent relations, previously to committing the offence bore an irreproachable character, but yielded to artful and long—continued seduction, and an express promise of marriage : whose delivery took _ place in secret, and whose shame was known to only | one or two persons, as, for example, the medical attendant and a single relation; and lastly, whose employers or other persons were able and desirous to take her into their service, if enabled again to earn her livelihood by the reception of her child.

”This is considered the most eligible case, and others are deemed by the Governors as more or less so, in proportion as they approach nearer to or recede further from that above stated ; their great object being, as they allege, to fulfil to the utmost the benevolent views of the principal Founder of the Hospital, who, as appears by his petition for the charter, was chiefly 58

golicitous that the mothers of illegitimate children should have other means within their reach of hiding their shame than the destruction of their miserable offspring, and thus they say they seek 'to hide the shame of the mother as well as to preserve the life of the chi] d" 39



REASONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHARITY.

The first sympathies of the human heart are doubtless excited by the presence of misery, originating in what may be termed the accidents of life, unassisted either by the transgression or omission of the individual.
Distress thus obtained, has at all times received, though not systematically, the compassionate alleviation which it requires. But there is misery of another class, which / has its origin in the moral weaknesses of our nature :' this, though more poignant than the former, inasmuch.
as it is followed by the bitterness of acknowledged transgression, did not in darker ages receive, because to: human wisdom it did not seem to deserve, the commiseration of mankind. But the Christian religion, by its admirable precepts and influences, has imbued thg social system of nations with a policy, which is founded upon a compassionate estimate of the weaknesses of !
humanity, and a just measure of relief to voluntary l repentance. This lesson of merey was evidently taught | by the Founder of Christianity himself, when he bade the Jew who was without sin cast the first stone at the \ repentant adulteress, and then calm]ly dismissed her with

 59

the charge to sin no more !* It was not that her crime was venial, but that He who desired not the death of a ginner, but rather that he should repent and live, saw in this wretched criminal, sufficient of remorse to be . the object of a lesson to mankind,—that the rigour of human law should not be exercised without a humane regard to the circumstances under which cerime may have been committted, and to the sincerity of the repentance which may have followed.

It may be asked, then, where is the man, imbued with Christian charity, who is prepared to take up the stone, and fling it at the poor victim of unprincipled seduction and brutal desertion ? Is he ready to bear in like manner the consequences of his own guilt, and to go down the stream of life with her in her shattered bark? No: and yet there are pseudo—moralists, afflicted with an unfortunate obliquity of the mind's eye, who rather than succour the necessities of one whose misfortune originated in evil, would hurl the offender



* Moore's poetical paraphrase of this subject naturally recurs to the mind ;”Ob, woman! if by simple wile Thy soul has stray'd from honour's track, ”Tis mercy only can beguile, By gentle ways, the wand'rer back.

” The stain that on thy virtue lies, Wash'd by thy tears, may yet decay ;

As olouds that sully morning skies, May all be wept in show'rs away.

© Go, go—be innocent and liveThe tongues of men may wound thee sore; But heav'n in pity can forgive,

And bids thee °Go, and sin no more!' ” 60

headlong into perdition. Alas ! the descent from virtue to vice is so easy, that but one step intervehes between them : and often, when we think we are secure, our foot slips, and we are involved in all the misery and degradation of sin ! This is the fate of us all : 'tis the fate of him who proudly glories in his own rectitude ; for what is the moral history of a man's life ? '”Tis but a succession from virtue to vice, from vice to repentance. Shall man, then, who is so weak as not to be able to sustain his own virtue, withhold from a wretched woman, who by wily arts has been deceived, that compassion for her error which he requires for himself ? And yet, those who oppose an Institution founded on such principles and practice as the Foundling Hospital is now conducted, answer by their conduct the very affirmative of this question. We ask in the language of an eminent writer,” ”Have faults no extenuations ? Is there no difference betwixt one propensely going out of the road, and continuing there through depravity of will,—and a hapless wanderer straying by delusion, and warily treading back her steps ?” The latter are the peculiar object of the Foundling Hospital ; and what Christian—what man is there whe will gainsay the humanity of such an Institution %

But there are certain individuals who endeavour to smother their humanity under the plea, that the policy—the good of society as they term it—is

>



* Sterne, who preached a sermon for the charity, in the chapel of the Hospital, in 1761. 61

© against the existence of any institution which shall relieve distress arising out of an evil action.* Now it may be well to answer these rigid interpreters by enquiring, how far the good of society is injured by the institution of an asylum for the protection of infants, whose wretched parents, first straying by delusion, warily tread back their steps ?

We know that shame is sometimes so powerful a monitor in the female breast, that it is impossible to resist its influence. Suppose then, the victim of seduction,—deceived, deserted, without even the shadow of hope in the distance to point to her relief ;suppose we say, this wretched creature overtaken by despair, and, in a fit of madness, to become the murderess of her infant! we ask‚, how is the good of society answered by driving her to this desperate act ?
Would it not have been better secured by an opposite course ? In the first place, by rescuing the infant from destruction, through the medium of some public asylum, it might be enabled hereafter to give its modicum of strength for the benefit of that public, through whose compassion it might have been saved. And secondly, by preserving the wretched parent from so desperate a erime, she might, by her penitence and future rectitude have maintained the cause of virtue, and once more enjoyed the value of reputation after having tasted the ill consequences of losing it.



* If this doctrine were generally acted upon, what would become of the numerous medical and surgical charities of the kingdom, which are half flled with cases originating in the weaknesses or vices of humanity ?
How many beds of such noble establishments as St. Bartholomew's, 8t.
Thomas's, Guy's, &c., &0., would become vacant ?
62

But we will suppose that the delirium of her despair does not reach to so great a height : we will take it for granted, that nature asserts so powerfully her claims, that this victim of seduction is ready to brave all congequences for the preservation of her offspring. How can she do this ?— she dare not apply to her relations : —they would reject and despise her. Her seducer has placed himself out of the reach of the law,—she has no means within herself—n0 hope! Being therefore unable to afford protection to her offspring in an honest way, she throws off for ever her remaining mantle of virtue and abandons herself to a prostituted life ? Is the good of society promoted by her swelling the awful liste of public prostitutes ? Is it promoted by hér bringing up her child in the path of vice instead of virtue ? No. And yet we are told by these spurious moralists, that it is unwise to step in between a hapless fomale and the punishment of lasting infamy which they would allot to her offence.

” Curge on the savage and unbending law Of stern society, that turns a speck In woman to an everlasting flaw !
And far from whisp'ring us to save or check Her course in wantonness, bids us draw Round her, like wretches hov'ring round a wreck,

All that the wave hath spar'd, to spoil and plunder, And sink the noble vessel farther under.”

Many are the indirect testimonies given by men of talent in favour both of the policy and the humanity towards which the objects of the Foundling Hospital are directed. Fielding, who had a profound knowledge of human nature and human action, puts into the mouth 63

of Mr. Allworthy, in his inimitable novel of ”Tom Jones,” the most benevolent and, at the same time, the most sgensible reasons for sheltering and befriending the supposed mother of the little foundling ; and in his parting admonition to her, makes the good man say, ”I have talked thus to you, child, not to insult you for what is past and irrecoverable, but to caution and strengthen you for the future. Nor should I1 have taken this trouble, but from some opinion of your good sense, notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have made, and from some hopes of your hearty repentance, which are founded on the openness and sincerity of your confession.” And when her enemies would have sacrificed her to ruin and infamy, by a shameful correction in a bridewell, ”so far” (says the author) ”from complying with this their inclination,



The following verses from the pen of H. W. Freeland, Esq., may not inappropriately be here inserted : O spurn her not! a mother's care Her childhood never knew, And she was once like angels fair, And innocent, and true.

O spurn her not! for she had none A warning word to say ;

Of all the flock there was but one That e'er was known to stray.

When proud man errs, a world that's blind' To justice and to truth Too quickly frames excuses kind For thoughtlessness and youth; When woman falls, her infamy A thousand lips proclaim, And busy tongues seem pleas'd to be The heralds of her shame, 64

by which all hopes of reformation would have been abolished, and even the gate shut against her, if her own inclination should ever hereafter lead her to choose the road of virtue, Mr. Allworthy rather chose to encourage the girl to return thither by the only possible means ; for (he adds) too true I am afraid it is that many women have become abandoned, and have sunk vo the last degree of vice, by being unable to retrieve the first shp.”

In the same strain the celebrated Dr. Burn* laments the abandonment of erring females, by which (he says) ” they become desperate and profligate, and are induced to make a trade of that vice, which at first was a pitiable weakness.” Surely the testimony of such men in favour of the preservation of God's creatures from destruction, is of infinitely greater value than all the theories of political economists !



Then pause, lest One that cannot err Should orush usurping pride,

And mercy, now withheld from her, Should be to you denied.

Goad not to acts of last despair, But kindly bid her live;

Most human 'tis to err—most fair And heavenly to forgive.

Pity her too confiding youth That early learn'd to stray ; And lead her back to holy truth

And virtue's sacred way.

Though fall'n, she looks from guilt and sin To mercy's throne above ;

And lost on earth, is still within The pale of heavenly love.

* Author of ”Burn's Justice.” 65

The late Rev. Sydney Smith, who, from the office he held, as one of the preachers of the Chapel of the Hospital, was well acquainted with the ” working” of it, thus writes :” A very unfounded idea exists in the minds of some men little acquainted with the principles on which we proceed, that the doors of this Hospital are flung open to the promiscuous reception of infants, and that every mother can here find an asylum for her offspring, whatever be her pretensions as a virtuous mother, an indigent mother, or a mother striving by every exertion of industry to give to her children creditable support. If this were so, this institution would aim directly, and in the most unqualified manner, at the destruction of two virtues on——whichvthe happiness—of.society __ principally depends—the affection of parents, and the virtue of women. We should be Counteracting, under the —name 6f charity, all those omnipotent principles of exertion founded on the love of offspring ; ——we should be weakening that sacred resolution to watch, to toil, and to meet all dangers, to suffer all paing, rather than children should know the shadow of a grief, or endure but an instant of sorrow ;—we should be whispering into the ear of poverty the most pernicious of all precepts ;—we should be inviting them to relax from the noblest efforts, to blunt the finest feelings, and to disobey the highest commandments of Almighty God. My brethren, these things are not so: our zeal is combined with greater knowledge; and experiencg

+ = nh * h‘ * * Willehteht * 66

has taught us, that the designs of the pious demand a circumspection not mfem

which the machinations of the wicked are Bursued. ‘

No child drinks of our cup or eats of our bread whose reception, upon the whole, we are not certain to be more conducive than pernicious to the interests of religion and good morals. We hear no mother whom it would not be merciless and shocking to turn away; we exercise the trust reposed in us with @ trembling and sensitive conseience ; we do not think it enough to say, This woman is wretched, and betrayed, and forsaken ; but we calmly reflect if it be expedient that her tears should be dried up, her loneliness sheltered, ‚and all her wants receive the ministration of charity.
: The object has uniformily been to distinguish between hardened guilt and the first taint of vice.
|By sheltermgandprotectmgonce,reclalmfor ever after, and not to doom to eternal infamy for one single stain of guilt. ”The fair and just way to estimate degrees of guilt is to oppose them to degrees of temptation ; and no one can know more perfectly than the conductors of this charity, the abominable artifices by wbhich the poor women who come to them for relief have been ruined, and the cruelty with which

they have been abandoned. My brethren, do not |

believe that these are the mere casualties of vice, and the irregularities of passion, which, though

well governed in the main, degenerate into occa-'\ sional excess, The mothers whom we relieve have'

a 67

been too often ruined by systematic profligacy—by men, the only object and occupation of whose life it is to discover innocence, and to betray it. There are men in this great city who live only for such a purpose, who are the greatest and most dreadful curses that the earth carries upon its surface. My dear brethren, if I were to show you in this church the figure of a wretched woman, a brutal, shameless creature, clothed in rags, and mouldering with disease; —if I were to tell you she had once been good and happy, that she once had that chance of salvation . which we all have this day ;—if 1 were to show you the man who had doomed her to misery in this world, and to hell in the world to come, what would your feelings be? If I were to bring you another as sick and as wretched as her, and were to point out the same man as the cause of her ruin, how would your indignation rise ? But if I were to tell you that the constant occupations of this man were to search for innocence and to ruin it ; that he was a seducer by profession ; that the only object for which he existed was to gratify his infamous passions at every expense of human happiness, would you not say that his life was too bad for the mercy of God ? If the earth were to yawn for him as it yawned for Dathan and Abiram, is there one eye would be lifted up to ask for mercy for his soul? It is from such wretches as these that — we strive to resceue unhappy women, to bring them back to God, to secure them from the scorn of the world that would break their hearts, and drive them into the deepest gulf of sin. But this is not all : to 68°

the cruelty of seduction is generally added the baseness of abandoning its object,—of leaving to perish in rags and in hunger a miserable woman, bribed by promises and oaths of eternal protection and regard.
Now, my brethren, let us be just even to sinners ; let us be merciful even to seducers in the midst of horror for their crimes; let us fix before our eyes every eircumstance that can extenuate them ; let us place by the side of the guilt the temptation, and judgeé them as we hope to be judged at a perilous season by the great Judge of us all. Let us call seduction the effect of youth and passion, still we have a right to expect all that compensation of good which youth and passion commonly afford, if we allow to them all the indulgence they usually require ; but what of youth' or passion is there in forgetting the unprotected weakness of women—in starving a creature whom you have ruined—in fiying from her for fear she should ask you for —bread ? Does youth thus unite fervour with meanness ? — Does it, without a single compensatory virtue, combine its own vices and the vices of — every other period of life ? Is it violent and sordid, avaricious and impassioned, the slave of every other feeling, and the master of generous compassion alone ?
This is not youth ; this has nothing to do with the origin of life ; it is cold and callous profligacy begun in brutal sensuality, fostered by irreligion, strengthened by association with bad men, and become so hardened, that it laughs at the very misery it creates. These are the feelings, and these the men, whose eruelty we are obliged to alleviate, and whose victims we are 69

destined to save. Is there any friend to virtue, however rigid, who can say that such an application of charity, so serupulous and so disceriminating, is not a solid augmentation of human happiness ? that it does not extend the dominion of the Gospel, and narrow the boundaries of sin? But let those who conceive that the claims even of such unhappy women should .
be rejected, consider what it is they do réject: they reject the weakness of sex ; they are deaf to the voice of ruined innocence ; they refuse assistance to youth, shuddering at the gulf of infamy ; they would turn out an indigent mother to the merciless world, at a period when she demands all that charity can afford, or compassion feel! But whatever be the crimes of the parents, and whatever views different individuals may take of the relief extended to them, there is no man who thinks that the children should perish for their erimes, or that those shall be doomed to suffer any misery who can have committed no fault. Therefore — this part of the institution is as free from the shadow of blame as every other part is free from the reality.”

Sir Thomas Bernard, Baronet, who was for some years Treasurer of the Hospital, writes as follows in 1803 :”The preserving and educating so many children, which without the Foundling Hospital, would have been lost to that society of which they are calculated to become useful members, is certainly a great and, public benefit. The adoption of a helpless, unprotected



VidaReportoftheSocietyforBetteringtheCondition'ofthePoor 70

infant, the watching over its progress to maturity, and fitting it to be useful to itself and others here, and to attain eternal happiness hereafter, these are no common or ordinary acts of beneficence; but their value and their importance are lost, when compared with the benefits which (without any prejudice to the original objects of the charity) the mothers derive from this Institution, as it is at present conducted. The preserving the mere vital functions of an infant cannot be put in competition with saving from vice, misery, and infamy, a young woman, in the bloom of life, whose erime may have been a single and solitary act of indiscretion. Many extraordinary cases of repentance, followed by restoration to peace, comfort, and reputation, have come within the knowdedge of the writer of this note. Some cases have occurred, within his own observation, of wives happily placed, the mothers of thriving families, who, but for the saving aid of this Institution, might have become the most noxious and abandoned prostitutes. Very rare are the instanceg, none has come within notice, of a woman relieved by the Foundling Hospital, and not thereby preserved from a course of prostitution Thereueatpresent5WWdrensupportedbythe Hospital, from extreme infancy up to the age of fifteen. This is the maximum number for the maintenance of which the present funds can be made available. It is only therefore as vacancies occur by apprenticeship or death, reducing this number, that otber children can be received. The average admissions per annum for the last three years was forty—one, 71

The average number of applications for the admission of children was 236. Independently, therefore, of a principle of action which governs the Committee in the selection of cases, the limited means at their disposal, as compared with the claims upon them, furnishes of itself a safe—guard or guarantee against a too free administration of this, the most important branch of the establishment.

It has been said (and gravely, though ridiculously, charged against the Hospital) that the Governors are liable to be deceived, and that in zome cases they have been imposed upon by designing persons. This may be so, it being the fate of all human institutions to be imperfect. Judges and juries are very often betrayed into error by false witnesses, but does any one pretend to assert that, therefore, courts of justice are useless ?
If the duration of institutions, of whatever nature, was to depend upon the perfect integrity of their administration, it is to be feared that their existence would be short—lived indeed !

THE PRIVILEGES OF THE GOVERNORS.

There is a class of men with so little charity in their hearts, as to make it an incomprehensible matter to them how any individual can be found, in this mercenary world, to contribute either his time or money to benevolent purposes without some com.mensurate benefit to himself ; but it is a fact, not72

withstanding, that there is a large body of individuals (and miserable indeed would society be without such persons), who from the purest motives of Christian charity, are to be found dispensing the good with which God has blest them, for the benefit of their poorer sojourners in this world of sin and misery, divested entirely of self—interest. Of that number are the Governors of the Foundling Hospital! It is asgerted without fear of contradiction, by one who has had for many years ample opportunity of ascertaining it, that there is not a charity in or out of the metropolis, more disinterestedly administered in the selection of its objects than this institution. It has become a prineiple (fully supported in practice), that no Governor shall interfere, either directly or indirectly, by recommendation or otherwise, in obtaining the ad—mission of a child. No interest is exercised except what the abstract misery of the case on its presentation excites, and all extraneous support is set aside.
The truth is, that the persons relieved are of that class who are unable to command patronage, or who dare not seek it lest their error and their misery should be betrayed ! This administration of an important branch of such an institution is thus asserted, because there is a ”vulgar error” on the subject, namely—that the Governors have the privilege of presenting children, after the manner of other establishments ; but a more unfounded statement never was erroneously conceived or ignorantly disseminated ! |

The pecuniary qualification of a Governor is a do73

nation of fifty pounds. There are pews in the Chapel set apart for the accommodation of Governors and their families free of charge.



NAMING AND BAPTIZING OF THE CHILDREN.

It has been the practice of the Governors, from the earliest period of the Hospital to the present time, to name the children at their own will and pleasure, whether their parents should have been known. or not.

At the baptism of the children first taken into the Hospital, which was on the 29th of March, 1741, it is recorded, that ” there was at the ceremony a fine appearance of persons of quality and distinction; his Grace the Duke of Bedford, our President, their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Richmond, the Countess of Pembroke, and several others, honouring the children with their names, and being their sponsors.”

Thus the register of this period presents the courtly names of Abercorn, Bedford, Bentinck, Montague, Marlborough, Newcastle, Norfolk, Pomfret, Pembroke, Richmond, Vernon, &c., &c., as well as those of numerous other living individuals, great and small, who at that time took an interest in the establishment.
When these names were exhausted, the authorities stole those of eminent deceased personages, their first

attack being upon the church. Hence we have a Wickliffe, Huss, Ridley, Latimer, Laud, Sancroft, 74

Tillotson, Tennison, Sherlock, &c., &c. Then come the mighty dead of the poetical race, viz.—Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakspeare, John Milton, &ec. Of the philosophers, Francis Bacon stands pre—eminently conspicuous. As they proceeded, the Governors were more warlike in their notions, and brought from their graves Philip Sidney, Francis Drake, Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden, Admiral Benbow, and Cloudesley Shovel. A more peaceful list followed this, viz.Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Vandyke, Michael Angelo, and Godfrey Kneller; William Hogarth, and Jane his wife, of course not being forgotten. Another class of names was borrowed from popular novels of the day, which accounts for Charles Allworthy, Tom Jones, Sophia Western, and Clarissa Harlowe. The gentle Isaac Walton stands alone. The last child received under the parliamentary system was named Kitty Finis. i

So long as the admission of children was confined within reasonable bounds, it was an easy matter to find names for them ; but during the ” parliamentary era ” of the Hospital, when its gates were thrown open to all comers, and each day brought its regiment of in‚fantry to the establishment, the Governors were sometimes in difficulties ; and when this was the case, they took a zoological view of the subject, and named them after the creeping things and beasts of the earth, or created nomenclature from various handicrafts or trades.

In 1801, the hero of the Nile and some of his friends honoured the establishment with a visit, and stood 75

sponsors to several of the children. The names given on this occasion were Baltic Nelson, William and Emma Hamilton, Hyde Parker, &c.

Up to a very late period the Governors were sometimes in the habit of naming the children after themselves or their friends; but it was found to be an inconvenient and objectionable course, inasmuch as wbhen they grew to man or womanhood, they were apt to lay claim to some affinity of blood with their nomenclators. The present practice therefore is, for the Treasurer to prepare a list, from which the children are named.

THE NURSING OF THE CHILDREN.

There can be no doubt that as the object of an institution of this nature is to save life, its managers should take all reasonable means for effecting such a desideratum. It is with this intention that the present Governors invariably obtain for the infants falling under their charitable care, wet nurses, unless it happens (which is rarely the case) that the age of a child renders such assistance unnecessary. The result, therefore, of this course is much more favourable than that adopted at the outset of the establishment.

In considering tbe question of mortality, the children of the Hospital should be classed under two heads, namely :—1st, those under the age of three 76

‚ years in the country, and Z2ndly, those from three to | fifteen in London.

With respect to the former, the chances against rearing many of them are very great, and for these reazgons. The mothers of the infants (who for the most part are very young) being desirous of ”hiding their shame” from their relatives, or those with whom they may happen to be placed, manage by contrivances and artifices to prevent a knowledge of their .
imprudence until it can no longer be concealed. The writer has known many instances where girls (for . their youth justifies the designation) have been living_ _

= with their mothers, with whom .they have been in constant intercourse, and even sleeping in the same bed; and yet have contrived to hide from their parents the fact of their unfortunate condition till the moment of confinement. In the same manner servants manage to undergo the labours of their office, and contrive to elude the observation of their mistresses, till the instant of giving birth to a child. The unnatural distortions of body by which their secret is preserved, are accompanied by. anzxieties of mind which do not arise only from. the dread of discovery. The prospect before her is dreary enough, but the retrospect is perhaps worse. ”She finds herself” (says the late Rev. John Hewlett,) ”'the victim of treachery and voluptuousness, where she fondly hoped to be the object . of pure and individual love ; and at a time when the languor of the body and the growing anziety of the mind powerfully clatm, and in general receive, additional tenderness, she is obliged to endure the severest

/ 77

affliction that fear could imagine, or unkindness produce.” Can it be wondered at theréfore, that an infant born under such circumstances should be de— / ficient in those physical developments which ötherwise it might have possessed ? But this is not all. The same powerful motive which prompted her first desire to conceal her disgrace, leads her to seek the only other opportunity she has of ensuring such concealment, namely—by putting her infant away from her, as soon after its birth as possible, to some nurse. who under & ”promise of payment, which the mother is unable to fulfil, engages to take upon herself the duties of the parent, duties which in nine cases out of ten she neglects to perform in a satisfactory manner, Beginning life with such opposing contingencies, and thus neglected, the infant is admitted into the Foundling Hospital. ”At least one—fifth of those admitted during the last nine years” (says the examining medical officer) ”have been in such a missrable state of emaciation, at to make it doubtful if they could be . reared at all, and of those presented in tolerable health, many receive a serious check from the change of nurse, condition, and other circumstances attending their admission. These infants are presented at all ages, from one to twelve months, and have been mostly exposed to all the injurious consequences arising from insufficient nursing and improger diet ; the greater number have not had the breast at all, and I have generally found on enquiry, that those who have had the ad. vantage of a wet nurse, have been fed at the same time with spoon food.” 78

The general health of the children within the walls of the Hospital is remarkably good; and with the exception of occasional epidemic visitations, they have been singularly free from the acute forms of disease to which children in general are so liable.

Perhaps the healthiness of the locality could not —be better exemplified than by this fact—that several adult foundlings who, from some organic defect, have from time to time become chargeable to the Hospital for life, and have scarcely ever quitted the walls of the building, have lived to a very advanced periodgome dying between the ages of seventy and eighty years, and others between eighty and ninety.*

THE DRSPOSAL OF THE CHILDREN.

The children are generally disposed of by apprenticeship : the girls at the age of sixteen to domestie



* ”Now that there seems to be so great a desire to move to the west—end of the metropolis, either to Belgravia or Tyburnia, it may be advisable to inform Her Majesty's subjects, that there is no healther part of this great town than the space contained within the following boundaries, viz.Holborn and New Oxford Street, on the south; the New Road, on the north; Gray's Inn, on the east ; and Tottenham Court Road, on the west ;—which space contains within it the twenty—two squares or open spaces, following :”1. Gray's Inn, 2. its Squares, 3. its Gardens; 4. Foundling Hospital, 6. its Gardens; 6. Burial Ground; 7. Mecklenburgh Square; 8. Regent Square; 9. Argyle Square; 10. Red Lion Square; 11. Queen Square; 12. Bloomsbury Square; 13. Bedford Square; 14. Russell Square; 15.
Torrington Square ; 16. Woburn Square; 17. Gordon Square ; 18. Tavistock Bquare; 19. Euston Square; 20. Burton Crescent; 21. University College Grounds; 22. Brunswick Square.

”If this were in Paris, it would be called ”Les Quartier des Carrés.” The streets generally run at right angles to each other. It is a gravelly goil, and the spring water excellent.”—The Builder, 79

gervice for a term of four years, and the boys at the age of fourteen as mechanics for a term of seven years —many of the boys, however, having a knowledge of music, volunteer into the bands of the army or navy.

THE REVENUE OF THE HOSPITAL.

There is much misconception and misunderstanding on the part of the public on this head.

In the memoir of Captain Coram, it is clearly shown that what property he had acquired was consumed in the pursuit of his philanthropic projects, and that he had no wealth by which to endow, even in a limited degree, an institution of this nature, being himself a recipient of charity for the last two years of his life.
The Hospital had nothing, therefore, to depend upon at its commencement, but the eleemosynary aid of the public, either in the form of donations or legacies ; and what permanent revenue it now has, may be asceribed to the fortuitous policy of the early Governors and the provident care of their successors. Thus the Governors in 1741, being in pursuit of a salubrious site for erecting an Hospital, fixed upon certain fields in the neighbourhood of London, deriving their name from ”Lamb's Conduit‚”* (in extent fifty—six acres,)



* The lands of the Hospital in the Parish of St. Pancras belonged to the Prior of the House of The Salvation of the Mother of God, of the Order of the Carthusians:—the same was granted by Qucen Elizabeth, in 1532, to — Vaugbhan and Ellis, 80

belonging to the Earl of Salisbury, who agreed to sell them to the charity for £5,500. The whole tract of land was purchased out of casual benefactions © and legacies, not because the charity required it for its then purposes, but because the Earl would not sell any fractional part of it. As London increased, it approached this property, and the Governors were induced seventy ycars afterwards to turn that to the pecuniary advantage of the charity, which its early managers had not the remotest idea would have ever become otherwise beneficial than as guaranteeing the healthy condition of the children. From this accidental circumstance, the Governors derive, from ground rents alone, an annual income equal to the purchasemoney ! This income is secured by leases of ninetynine years' duration, which leases will expire between 1890 and 1920 ; so that at present the income from this source must remain stationary.

Some imaginative persons have invested the Hospital already with the property in which it has only a remote reversionary interest, and they unwisely withhold their charitable hands, not because they disapprove of the institution, but because it is already so rich! No charity can be rich unless it has a surplus revenue after every reasonable opportunity has offered for disposing of it upon the objects for whose benefit it was created. This is not the case with the Foundling Hospital. ”It confines itself” (says Bishop Thirlwall) ”to a particular class of cases —one, however, which is unhappily so large, that it constantly overgrows the means of relief.” It should 81

be understood therefore, that to these ground—rents, and the interest of certain stock, which has been nursed by the great care of the Guardians of the Charity, to the Pew Rents and contributions at the chapel doors and other such casualties, the Hospital is wholly dependent for support.

The walls of the building present. it is true, a goodly array of tablets, noting considerable benefactions and legacies, but it should be recollected that the greater part of this money was swallowed up in .
the vortex caused by Parliamentary interference, and that only during the last sixty years have the (iovernors been able to lay up for the Hospital a pecuniary foundation.

Of those who were early benefactors, the name of Omychund, a black merchant of Calcutta, should be specially mentioned. He bequeathed to the Foundling and Magdalen Hospitals, 37,500 current rupees, to be equally divided ; but unfortunately a portion only of this munificent legacy could be extracted from the grasp of Huzzorimal, his executor, notwithstanding the zealous interference of Warren Hastings. Esq., the Governor—General, and other eminent functionaries.

The following is a legacy of another kind. The testator was one Shirley, of Stratford, in Essex.

”The whole of my Dramatic Works, consisting of nine Tragedies, one Comedy, and five smaller productions, I bequeath to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, in trust for that greatliy useful Institution, hoping their being enabled to get them

G 82

performed, unaltered or mutilated, in one of the London Theatres, they being certainly not inferior to any set of such performances produced at the present age ; and should they be acted, I request the repayment out of the profits to all subscribers to me, which can amount to but a small sum of money.” The reader will be able to estimate the value of this bequest !

In 1759, William Williams, Esq., who possessed property in Jamaica, bequeathed the same to certain persons ”in trust to sell the same, together with all and every the Negro, Mulatto, and other slaves whatsoever to me belonging, with their future offspring, issue, or inerease, and to pay the net proceeds to the Treasurer of the Foundling Hospital. His nezxzt bequest is as follows ;:—”Item, I give and bequeath to that most abandonedly wicked, vile, detestable rogue and impostor, who hath assumed, and now does, or lately did go by the name of Gersham Williams, pretending to be a son of mine, one shilling only‚ to buy him an halter, wherewith to hang himself, being what he hath for a long, long, very long while past meritted and deserved from the law of the hands of the hangman, for his great and manifold villanies.”

At the demise of his reputed father, this ” Gersham Williams,” made many attempts to compromise matters with the Governors of the Hospital regarding the legacy, but he proved a slippery character, and failed in his object. The legacy yielded to the charity £5563.,

 83

THE BENEVOLENT FUND FOR ADULTS.

This Fund has no connection with the Funds of the Hospital, and is the result of private subscriptions, donations and legacies, which are found very inadequate to the objects contemplated.

In stating what these objects are, it is necessary to offer gome explanation.

The Hospital was incorporated for the maintenance of ”deserted Young Children,” and it is expressly provided by the Act of Parliament confirming the Charter, that none of the children shall obtain a parochial settlement by reason of their residence within its walls.

If, therefore, they do not acquire a settlement by apprenticeship, they are without any legal provision whatever in their after—life, except the Governors adopt one of two alternatives,—namely, to abandon them in their utmost need to the casualties of the world, or (what is worse still) to seek out the parish scttlement of the mother—an act which, besides being impossible in nine cases out of ten, would defeat the very principle and purpose of the Hospital, and the benign object it has in view as regards the repentant and well—doing mother,

Now, at other institutions, the reception of children is determined finally by their mental or physical developments, but at the Foundling Hospital they are received at so early an age, as to prevent the possibility of their state, in either case, being ascertained ; 84

consequently, as they grow up some of them are found, from time to time, incapable of being placed out in the world, being either idiotic, blind, deformed, or constitutionally incapable of earning their living.

The Governors of the Hospital have hitherto taken a paternal and comprehensive view of their duty in such cases, by maintaining them out of the General Funds, although it had often been questioned whether the means at their disposal were applicable to such purposes.

To test this, the opinion of Counsel has recently been taken, by whom it is declared that the maintenance of Adult Foundlings ” does not properly fall within the scope of the objects for which the Foundling Hospital was established.”

Under these circumstances, it is proposed to enlarge the boundary of this ” Benevolent Fund,” so as to embrace the objects above stated, along with the other objects contemplated at its formation, namely :Granting Annual Pensions or Weekly Allowances to aged or infirm Foundlings, who have been out in the world, and whose laborious lives have been without reproach, or whose sickness has been unprovoked by intemperance or other misconduct.

A special appeal is therefore made on behalf of this truly Samaritan Fund.

Donations and Subscriptions will be thankfully received by the Secretary of the Hospital.

Bequests made payable to the Trustees of the Fund would be secured.
85

THE EARLY ASSOCIATION OF THE HOSPITAL WITH ARTISTS.

Sir Robert Strange, in his ” Enquiry into the Rise and Establishment of the Royal Academy of Arts,” makes the following remark :” The donations in painting, which several artists presented to the Foundling Hospital, were among the first objects of this nature which had engaged the attention of the publice. The artists observing the effect that these paintings produced, came, in the year 1760, to a resolution to try the fate of an Exhibition of their works. This effort had its desired effect : the public were entertained, and the artists were excited to emulation.”

And, again, in his ”Conduct of the Royal Academicians,” he says” Accident has often been observed to produce what the utmost efforts of industry have failed to accomplish ; and something of this kind seems to have happened here. As liberty has ever been considered the Friend and parent of the Fine Arts, it is natural for their professors to revere the memory of all those who were the champions and assertors of that invaluable blessing, paticularly those of our own country : on this principle it was, that the artists we are now speaking of‚, had an Annual Meeting at the Foundling Hospital, to commemorate the landing of King William. To this charity, several of their body had made 86

donations in Painting, Sceulpture, &c., which, being accessible to the public, made those artists more generally known than others, and this circumstance it was that first suggested an Exhibition—which was no gsooner proposed than approved. The Committee, consequently, who were the proposers, received directions to issue proper notices of the intention. The performances of many ingenious men, hitherto unknown, were received, and on the 21st day of April, 1760, an Exhibition was opened in the great room belonging to the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, in the Strand ; on which it will be sufficient to observe, that the success was equal to the most sanguine expectations ; the public were pleased and the artists applauded ; those already known received additional reputation, and such as were not, became the immediate acquaintance of the public.”

Edwards, also, in his ”Anecdotes of Painters,” speaking of the unsuccessful attempts made to form an Academy, says”Although these endeavours of the artists had not succeeded, they were far from being so discouraged as not to continue their meetings, as well as their studies; and the nezxt effort they made towards acquiring the attention of the public, was connected with the Foundling Hospital.

” This institution, so humane in its primitive intention, whatever may be thought of its effects, was incorporated by charter, dated 1739. A few years after that period, the present building was erected ; but as the income of the charity could with no pro87

priety be expended on decorations, many of the princeipal artists of that day voluntarily exerted their talents for the purpose of ornamenting several of the apartments of the Hospital, which otherwise must have remained without decoration. 'The pictures thus produced, and generously given, were permitted to be seen by any visitor, upon proper application. The spectacle was so new that it made a considerable impression on the public, and the favourable reception these works experienced, impressed the artists with an idea of forming a public exhibition.” A more recent writer has said, ” that it is within the walls of the Foundling the curious may contemplate the state of British Art, previously to the epoch when George the Third first countenanced the histo— / rical talent of West.” —— —|

William Hogarth, the celebrated painter, was foremost amongst those who first cordially co—operated in forwarding the views of the Founder of the Hospital.
In the charter for its incorporation, he appears as one of its constituent members, under the denomination of ”a Governor and Guardian,” along with a host of other ”trusty and well—beloved subjects” of his Majesty George the Second.

Nor did Hogarth hold his appointment to be merely nominal, for we find him subseribing his money, and attending the courts or general meetings at the Hospital, as one of its active members, and joining heartily in carrying out the designs of his friend, the venerable Founder.

The charter of the Hospital authorized the Gover88

nors to appoint persons to ask alns on behalf of the charity and to receive subseriptions; and the first artistical work of Hogarth in aid of this object, was ° to prepare a ”head piece” to a power of attorney drawn up for the purpose: a copy of which head piece is annexed, taken from the original plate in the possession of the Hospital.

The principle figure is that of Captain Coram himself, with the Charter under his arm. Before him the / beadle carries an infant, whose mother having dropped a dagger with which she might have been momentarily tempted to destroy her child, kneels at his feet, while he, with that benevolence with which his countenance is so eminently marked, bids her be comforted, for her babe will be nursed and protected. On the dexter side of the print, is a new born infant left close to a stream of water which runs under the arch of a bridge.
Near a gate on a little eminence in the pathway above, a woman leaves another child to the casual care of the next person who passes by. In the distance is a . village with a church. In the other corner are three boys coming out of a door, with the king's arms over it, with emblems of their future employment; one of them poises a plummet, a second holds a trowel, ard a third, whose mother is fondly pressing him to her bosom, has in his hand a card for combing wool. The next group, headed by a lad elevating a mathematical instrument, are in sailors' jackets and trousers. Those on their right hand, one of whom has a rake, are in the uniform of the school. The attributes of the three little girls in the foreground—a spinning wheel, a

sampler and broom—indicate female industry and ingenuity.

It should be remarked that the designs of the Hospital, foreshadowed by this interesting engraving, did not come into actual operation till two years afterwards.

In May, 1740, that is, seven months after the granting of the Charter, at the Annual Court, ” Mr. Folkes acquainted the Governors, that Mr. Hogarth had presented a whole length picture of Mr. Coram, for this Corporation to keep in memory of the said Mr. Coram's having gsolicited, and obtained His Majesty's Royal Charter for this Charity.” Writing of himself some years afterwards, Hogarth says :” The portrait which I painted with most pleasure, and in which I particularly wished to excel was that of Captain Coram for the Foundling Hospital; and” (he adds, in allusion to his detractors as a portrait painter,) ”if 1 am so wretched an artist as my enemies assert, it is somewhat strange that this, which was one of the first I painted the size of life, should stand the test of twenty years' competition, and be generally thought the best portrait in the place, notwithstanding the first painters in the kingdom exerted all their talents to vie with it.” *



* The rival portraits here alluded to are, George the Second, Patron of the Foundation, by Shackleton; Lord Dartmouth, one of the Vice Presidents, by Mr. Reynolds (afterwards Sir Joshua); Taylor White, Treasurer of the Hospital, in crayons, by Cotes; Mr. Milner and Mr. Jacobson, by Hudson; Dr. Mead‚ by Ramsay ; Mr. Emerson, by Highmore; and Francis Fauquier, Esq., by Wilson, 90

Hogarth is said to have displayed no little vanity regarding his pretensions as a portrait painter. In proof of this, it is related of him, that being at dinner with Dr. Cheselden, and some other company, he was informed that John Freke, Surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, had asserted in Dick's Coffee House, that Greene was as eminent in composition as Handel.
”That fellow, Freke,” eried Hogarth, ”is always shooting his bolt absurdly one way or another. Handel is a giant in music, Greene only a light Florimel kind of composer.” ”Aye, but” said the other, ” Freke declared you were as good a portrait painter as Vandyck.” ” There he was in the right,” quoth Hogarth, ”and so I am, give me but my time, and let me choose my subject.”

In March, 1741, the Governors resolved to commence upon the good purposes of their Charter, but not being able to obtain a suitable building, they took houses in Hatton Garden, near the Charity School, and opened them as receptacles and nurseries for Infants. In the minutes of that month is the following entry :” Mr. Taylor White acquainted the Committee that Mr. Hogarth had painted a Shield, which was put up over the door of this Hospital, and presented the same to this Hospital.”

This shield, or sign, has not been preserved, nor is there any record of its design, but it is not improbable that it was an emblematical sketch similar in character, if not actually the same, as the Arms of the Hospital presented to the Court of Governors, by the Authorities 91

of the Heralds' College, in 1747, and which is said by Nichols, in his Biographical Anecdotes, to have been designed by Hogarth. The technical description of these Arms is as follows, viz. :

” Party per fesse, Azure & Vert, a young child lying naked and exposed, extending its right hand proper.
In chief a Crescent Argent between two Mullets of six points Or ; and for a Crest on a Wreath of the colourg, a Lamb Argent, holding in its mouth a Sprig of Thyme proper, supported on the dexter side by a terminal figure of a Woman full of Nipples proper, with a Mantle Vert, the term Argent being the emblem of Liberty, represented by Britannia holding in her right hand upon a staff proper, a Cap Argent, and habited in a Vest Azure, girt with belt Or, the under garment Gules.” Motto ” Help.” __

In 1740, the Governors of the Charity commenced erecting on the land they had purchased the present Building, the western wing of which was finished and inhabited in 1745. It was at this period that Hogarth contemplated the adornment of its walls with works of Art, with which view he solicited and obtained the co—operation of some of his professional brethren. At a Court of Governors, held on the 31st December, 1746, Hogarth and Rysbrach, the sculptor, being present as Governors of the Hospital—” The Treasurer acquainted this General Meeting that the following ” Gentlemen, Artists, had severally presented, and agreed to present, performances in their different professions, for ornamenting this Hospital, viz. : Mr. Francis Hayman, Mr. James Wills, Mr. Joseph Highmore, Mr.
92

Thomas Hudson, Mr. Allan Ramsay, Mr. George Lambert, Mr. Samuel Scott, Mr. Peter Monamy, Mr. Richard Wilson, Mr. Samuel Whale, Mr. Edward Hately, Mr.
Thomas Carter, Mr. George Moser, Mr. Robert Taylor, and Mr. George Pyne. Whereupon this General Meeting elected, by ballot‚, the said Mr. Francis Hayman, Mr. James Wills, Mr. Joseph Highmore, Mr. Thomas Hudson, Mr. Allan Ramsay, Mr. George Lambert, Mr.
Samuel Scott, Mr. Peter Monamy, Mr. Richard Wilson, Mr. Samuel Whale, Mr. Edward Hately, Mr. Thomas Carter, Mr. George Moser, Mr. Robert Taylor, and Mr. John Pyne‚, Governors and Guardians of this Hospital.
”Resolved,” That the said Artists, and Mr. Hogarth, Mr. Zinke, Mr. Rysbrach, and Mr. Jacobson, or any three or more of them, be a Committee to meet annually on the öth of November, to consider of what further ornaments may be added to this Hospital, without any expense to the charity.”

Whether these artists were previously associated as a Society elsewhere for.the promotion of the Arts, or for conviviality, does not appear, or whether they began to form themselves from this time and 6ut of this occasion, cannot be determined, but it seems probable that they were part of a Society alluded to by Edwards, who says—”Of the Dilettante Society, the author is not sufficiently informed to give a perfect account, and therefore can only relate the following eircumstances. Its original institution was prior to either of those already mentioned., It commenced 93

upon political principles, and, as far as it was then known to the public, was not approved, being considered as rather a disaffected assembly. But they soon changed the object of their meetings, and turned their attention to the encouragement of the Arts, and made some attempts to assist in the establishment of & public Academy.”

Assuming that the artists who thus proposed to hold an annual meeting at the Hospital, belonged to the Dilettante Society, it may be said that whatever their previous objects or bias might have been, their present purpose, notwithstanding the ominousness of the day fixed on for their meetings (viz. : the 5th of November), originated in as harmless a conspiracy as could be devised, that of plotting for the advancement of the Arts, and of a public charity.

It seems that these meetings, which commenced with the modest suggestion ”that any three or more of them be a Committee,” grew so mightily, that that which was intended to be a mere matter of business, ended as most associations of Englishmen do) in an occasion of conviviality, and that on the öth of November of each succeeding year, and for many years, the artists of the day, and the patronizers of the Arts, dined at the Hospital.*

In the meantime, the donations in Painting, &ec., the result of these meetings, increased, and ” being exhibited to the public, drew a daily crowd of spectators



* It appears by a document headed ” Delettante, Vikuosi‚ Feast,” that no less than 154 persons, more or less distinguished, dined at the Hospital on the Sth November, 1757.
94

in their splendid equipages ; and a visit to the Foundling became the most fashionable morning lounge in the Reign of George II. The eclat thus excited in favour of the Arts, suggested the annual exhibition of the united artists, which institution was the precursor of the Royal Academy.”t

Hogarth was not only the prineipal contributor, but the leader of his brethren in all that related to ornamenting the Hospital, and therefore, it is as much due to his benevolence and generosity, as to his distinguished talents, that his further connexion with the institution should receive special notice in this compilation.

At a Court of Governors on the 9th of May, 1750, (Hogarth being present),” 'Che Treasurer acquainted the General Court, that Mr. Hogarth had presented the Hospital with the remainder of the tickets Mr. Hogarth had left, for the .
chance of the picture he had painted, of The March to Finchley, in the time of the late Rebellion ; and that the fortunate number for the said picture being among those tickets, the Hospital had received the said picture.

” Resolved,” That the thanks of this General Court be given to Mr. Hogarth, for the said benefaction ; which the VicePresident accordingly did.”

In the ”General Advertiser” of the Ist of May, 1750, the same circumstance is thus related :+ Vide Catalogue Ratsonnég of West's pictures, 95

”Yesterday, Mr. Hogarth's subsceription was closed.
1843 chances being subseribed for, Mr. Hogarth gave the remaining 167 chances to the Foundling Hospital, and the same night delivered the picture to the Governors.”

Ireland, in his Nlustrations of Hogarth, remarks as follows on this subject :”By the fortunate number being among those pregented to a charity, which he so much wished to serve, the artist was highly gratified. In a private house, it would have been in a degree secluded from the public, and, by the lapse of time, have been transferred to those who could not appreciate its merit, and from either negligence or ignorance, might have been destroyed by damp walls, or effaced from the canvass by picture cleaners. Heore, it was likely to remain a permanent and honourable testimony of his talents and liberality. Notwithstanding all this, Hogarth soon after waited upon the Treasurer of the Hospital, and acquainted him that if the Trustees thought proper, they were at liberty to dispose of the picture by auction. His motive for giving this permission it is not easy to assign : it might have originated in a desire to enrich a foundation which had his warmest wishes, or a natural, though ill—judged ambition to have his greatest work in the possession of some who had a collection of the old masters, with whom he in no degree dreaded a competition. Whether his mind was actuated by these, or other causes, it is not important ; certain it is, that his opipion changed: he requested the Trustees would not dispose of it, and 96

never afterwards consented to the measure he himself had originally proposed. The late Duke of Ancaster's father wished to become a purchaser, and once offered the Trustees three hundred pounds for it. I have been told, that a much larger sum was since proffered by another gentleman.”

It is related in the Gentleman's Magazine, on the authority of an anonymous writer, ” that a ZLady was the possessor of the fortunate number, and intended to present it to the Foundling Hospital; but that some person having suggested what a door would be open to scandal, were any of her sex to make such a present, it was given to Hogarth, on the express condition that it should be presented in his own name.”

The next work which Hogarth presented, was ” Moses before Pharaoh's Daughter.” This was painted expressiy for the Hospital, and appears to have. originated in a conjoint agreement, between Hayman, Highmore, Wills, and himself, that they should each fill up one of the compartments of the Court Room with pictures, uniform in size, and of guitable subjects taken from Seripture.

The Hospital had thus obtained from Hogarth, a picture in each of the styles of painting which he had attempted, and it may be said without fear of contradiction, that the best specimens of those styles are within its walls. It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that as Hogarth throughout his life had uniformly opposed the establishment of a Public Academy of Arts, he should, by the very course he pursued in encouraging 97

and concentrating at the Foundling Hospital an exhibition of the talents of British artists, have himself promoted a consummation of the object which he had all along deprecated. ” In consequence,” says Nichols, ” of the public attention bestowed upon the paintings presented to the Foundling Hospital by Hogarth, the academy in St. Martin's Lane, began to form themselves into a more important body, and to teach the arts under regular professors. But, extraordinary as it may appear, this scheme was so far from being welcomed by Hogarth, as indicative of a brighter era in the Fine Arts, that he absolutely discouraged it, as tending to allure many young men into a profession in wkhich they would not be able to support themselves, and at the same time to degrade what ought to be a liberal profession, into a merely mechanical one.” In the year 1760 the Hospital had grown to such an extent as to embrace within its arms several thousands of children, so that the Governors were obliged to open Branch Establishments in the Country to receive them. One of these establishments was at Ackworth, in Yorkshire. At this place the children were usefully employed in the manufacture of cloth.* This led some of the artists to the benevolent and enthusiastic idea of promoting the good of the charity



* One of the schemes for employing the children was the erection of a cotton machine invented by Lewtis Pau!, for whom Dr. Johnson framed a letter to the Duke of Bedford, President of the Hospital, on the subject,of which the following is a copy :” Mr LorD, ” As beneficence is never exercised but at some expense of ease and leisure, your Grace will not be surprised that you are subjected, as the general H 98

by appcaring at their Festival in 1761, in clothing made by these children.

The following document is confirmatory of this interesting eircumstance, and as evidence of the earnestness of the artists in this step, there is extant a letter dated 15th December, 1760, from the Rev. Dr. Lee, the



Guardian of deserted infants, and protector of their Hospital, to intrusion and importunity, and you will pardon those who intend, though perhaps unskilfally, the promotion of the charity, the impropriety of their address for the goodness of their intention. I therefore take the liberty of proposing to your Grace's notice a machine for spinning cotton, of which 1 am the inventor and proprietor, as proper to be erected in the Foundling Hospital, its structure and operation being such that a mixed number of the children, from five to fourteen years, may be enabled by it to earn their food and clothing. In this machine, thus useful, and thus appropriated to the public, I hope to obtain from Parliament, by your Grace's recommendation, such & right as shall be thought due to the inventor.

”Iknow, my Lord, that every project must encounter opposition, and I would not encounter it, but that I think myself able to surmount it.
Mankind has prejudices against every new undertaking, which are not always prejudices of ignorance. He that only doubts what he does not know, may be satisfied by testimony, at least, by that of his own eyes ; but a projector, my Lord, has more dangerous enemies—the envious and the interested, who will neither hear reasons nor see facts, and whose animosity is more vehement as their conviction is more strong.

”I do not implore your Grace's patronage for a work existing only in possibility ; I have a machine erected, which I am ready to exhibit to the view of your Graco, or of any proper judge of mechanical performances whenever you shall be pleased to nominate. I shall decline no trial; I shall geek no subterfuge; but shall shew,‚ not by argument, but practical experience, that what I have here promised will be easily performed.

”I am an old man, oppressed with many infirmities, and therefore cannot pay that attendance which your Grace's high quality demands, and my respect would dictate; but whenever you shall be pleased to assign me an audience, I shall explain my' design with the openness of a man who desires to hide nothing, and receive your Grace's commands with the submission which beconres,

” My Lord, ” Your Grace's most obedient and most humble servant.” 99

indefatigable Governor of the Hospital at Ackworth, in which he says to the Treasurer in London, ”Mr. Paine has wrote about clothing for the artists of the Turk's Head Club, and I should be glad to know if the twenty you speak of are not the same he writes about, and says will be in number sixty in a little time. He writes in the name of those gentlemen who will honour us with an uniform against their next Annual Meeting.
I am to send him patterns of colours, but hope he'll choose that of your coat or something near it, because the deep coppers, from the nature of the dye, render the wool too tender for the spinning of our young artists to make any moderate profit. Of this you'll please to give a hint, as it may not be so proper to insert it in my letter to him, which probably he will show to his brethren.”

At what precise period these meetings of the artists at the, Hospital ceased is not known, but there is no doubt that as the Royal Academy, which was founded in 1768, became established and consolidated, the convivial presence of its members was transferred to a ‚more appropriate arena. The ”Gentleman's Magazine,” of the öth November, 1763, thus testifies that up to that period the meetings were still continued.

” The Artists of London and Westminster held their Anniversary at the Foundling Hospital in commemoration of the day, and were entertained by the children ” with an anthem. A blind boy performed on the organ, and a little girl of five years of age the solo part of the vocal music.”

Charles Lamb, in one of his critical essays, remarks that Hogarth seemed to take particular delight in introducing Children into his works.

As evidence that this characteristic was not the mere ideality of a painter, but emanated from that generous heart which guided his actions, the following anecdote of this extraordinary man is recorded.

It was the practice at this period of the Hospital, (as indeed it is at the present time) to nurse the Children of the establishment in the country till about 101 three years of age, by distributing them amongst cottagers in certain districts, superintended by competent authorities in the neighbourhood.

These authorities formerly performed their interesting office gratwitous!ly, and they consisted of resident gentry or ladies. In or about the year 1760, the Governors, at the request of Hogarth, sent several of these infants to Chiswick, where the painter resided, he engaging, along with Mrs. Hogarth, to see them properly taken care of. It is impossible to revert to the life of Hogarth, so full of labour in his art, and at the latter period of his existence, so charged with vexation and controversy, by reason of the defection and abuse of his quondam friends, Wilkes and Churchill, without feeling some degree of admiration for one, who amidst all this, should be found engaged in so humble a charity as that of watching over the destiny of parentless and helpless foundlings.

Charity has the peculiar charm of engaging for her attendants, men of all kinds of political sentiments, but even she is not free from the consequences of private enmity or animosity. This was evidenced by the quarrel between Wilkes and Hogarth. They were both associated in the same work of benevolence at the Foundling Hospital, meeting at the some board as Governors, but no sooner did a personal quarrel arise between them, than they ceased to attend in their places, as if each was afraid of meeting the other, even within the walls of Charity herself.

”Before the birth of Hogarth,” say Cunningham, ””there are many centuries in which we relied wholly 102

on foreign skill. With him and after him arose a succession of eminent painters, who have spread the fame of British Art far and wide.” The works of some of those who arose with him will be found in the catalogue of pictures belonging to the Hospital at the end of this book. Though dazzled by the luminaries in art in these modern days, we must not forget that their fires have been kindled by the lesser lights of the past. THE CHAPEL.

The Chapel was erected, by subscription, in the year 1747, on the original plan of Mr. Jacobsen, forming the centre feature of the north and south fronts of the Hospital building.

Its frontage was then limited in extent to the five middle divisions of the open arcades, and the elevation of the superstructure being detached from the main .
buildings on each side, presented more distinctness of character in itself, and was advantageous in its effect to the general design of the building. The lower part, or ground plan of the chapel, was@hus isolated by a continued arched corridor, forming a sub—structure for.
the extention of the upper part, which, on the north and south sides, became a portion of the original building, and was subsequently extended over the east and west ends.

The lower area of the building.continues of the original extent, its enclosure forming the appropriate 103

basement of a regular colonnade and entablature of the Ionic order, raised on pedestals, with intermediate continued balustrade, enclosing the front of the sittings in the upper part of the building throughout.

A coved ceiling, of handsome design, springing from tbe entablature of the colonnade, extends over the central area, or main division of building, with enriched bands and pendants on its soffite, and the ceilings of the side and east—end divisions are enriched by soffites and arched bands, of appropriate unity of design with the architecture of the colonnade.

The west end is entirely appropriated to the occupation of the children, and for the organ and choir.

The design and effect of the interior of this building are admitted to be striking and impressive ; and as an instance in the mode of distribution of so large a portion of the congregation, at an upper level, with pleasing uniformity and picturesque architectural effect, without the disfigurement generally attendant upon galleries, under the most favourable circum.stancs ; it may be considered a specimen of some originality, and worthy of observation. Some alteration and improvement of the details of the style and decoration of the interior, was probably made at the period of the extention of this building, and the windows at the eastern end filled with stained glass.
This enrichment has lately been extended also to the windows on the south front. |

The paneling on the sides of the lower area, forming the basement of the colonnade, being of regular design and suitable proportions for pictures, would, at this 104

favourable period for the advancement of fresco painting, become peculiarly appropriate for a partial, if not entire application of them for sacred subjects, after the great masters, and congenial to the spirit and advancement of the British art, and the distinguished artists that fostered the original establishment of the Charity.

The simple and appropriate distinction given to the divisions of paneling immediately connected with the altar—table, on the east side, could always be continued to be maintained. The cost of the erection of the Chapel was £6,490.

Some of the windows of the Chapel are ornamented by the armorial bearings of the Governors and Benefactors, in stained glass, and there is a fine representation of ” Faith, Hope, and Charity,” by Wilmshurst, which forms the centre window of the eastern gallery.

The advertisement inviting subscribers set forth, ” that the Governors being earnestly desirous that the children under their care should be early instructed in the principles of religion and morality, and having no place of puplic worship to which the children and servants of the Hospital could conveniently resort, have resolved to erect a Chapel adjoining to their Hospital ; but that no part of the revenue of the said Hospital which is or shall be given for the support of the children, may be diverted from that use; and in order to defray the expense of erecting the said Chapel, they have opened a subscription for that purpose.”

His Majesty George IL. subsceribed £2,000 towards the erection, and afterwards £1,000 towards supplying 105

a preacher in the Chapel, to instruct the children in the Christian religion, and for other incidental expenses. The communion plate was presented by a Governor who desired to be ”unknown ;” and the EKing's upholsterer gave the velvets for the pulpit, &c.
The Governors had been early taught that their Chapel was capable of being converted into a source of pecuniary means for increasing the usefulness of the work they had in hand. What Handel began, other eminent musicians continued, and the Governors having received several blind children into the establishment (during the general and indiscriminate admission), they were instructed in music, and became a fruitful source of advantage to the funds of the charity. For upwards of one hundred and thirty years the Chapel has been established, and if the taste of the public for sacred music has increased and that taste has any beneficial influence on the minds of the people, it has been one of the humble instruments for effecting it.*



® The class of music used in the chapel has, during the last sixty years undergone a great change, doubtless in favour of the more refined taste of modern times. The original Choir of the Chapel consisting of Blind Foundlings, the music was nocessarily adapted to their powers and capacities.
In fact, most of the popular Hymns sung in the Chapel at the time, were written and composed for them. The Poet of the Chapel was the Resident Apothecary, Mr. McLellan. The words of two of his Hymns appear to me to be worth noticing here. The music of the first was by Dr. Cook; the socond, by John Printer, a Blind Foundling.

CHRISTMAS HYMN.

EResorcg, the promis'd Saviour'g come ; Him shall the blind behold,

The deaf shall hear ; and by the dumb His wond'rous works be told.
106

The expenses in supporting the Chapel are very considerable, and the only return is from the pew rents and contributions of the public at the Chapel doors; should these diminish so as to reduce the income



The weary nations shall have rest, The rage of war shall cease ;

The earth with innocence be blest, And plenty dwell with peace,

Light from its sacored source shall spread O'er all its saving beams ;

In pastures fair shall all be fed, * All drink of comfort's streams.

Sweet as the breeze on Carmel's brow, The waste shall shed perfume ;

There lilies spring, and violets grow, And Sharon's rose shall bloom.

Rejoice, the promis'd Saviour's come; Him shall the blind behold,

The deaf shall hear; and by the dumb His wond'rous works be told.

THANKSGIVING HYMN.

ALzrentt Lord! dispose each mind To seek the good of human kind ; Teach us with others' joys to glow ; Teach us to feel for others' woe.

Behold in misery's dreary shade,

The widow with her children laid ;

Hear them, with piteous moans, deplore Husband and father now no more. +

The helpless babe, by hunger prest, Clings to the famish'd mother's breast : In vain it ev'ry effort tries, Life's fountaing yield it no supplies.
Thanks be to God, who heard our cry When not one earthly friend was nigh!
To Him our voices let us raise

u In songs of gratitude and praise.
107

below the expenditure, the Governors would have no alternative but to lessen the attractiveness of the gervice by dispensing with the choir.



Handel.—Handel, as if influenced by a kindred feeling with Hogarth (for genius is ever noble and generous), very soon engaged in the work of charity at this popular institution. On the 4th May, 1749, he attended the Committee at the Hospital, and offered a performance of vocal and instrumental music, the money arising therefrom to be applied towards finishing of the Chapel.

This performance is thus alluded to in the ”Gentleman's Magazine” of that month :” The Prince and Princess of Wales, with a great number of persons of quality and distinction, were at the Chapel of the Foundling Hospital, to hear several pieces of vocal and instrumental music composed by George Frederick Handel, Esq., for the benefit of the foundation. 1st. The music of the late Fire Works, and the anthem on the Peace ; Znd. Select pieces from the Oratorio of Solomon, relating to the dedication of the temple ; and 3rd. Several pieces composed for the occasion, the words taken from Scripture, applicable to the charity and its benefactors. There was no collection, but the tickets were at half—a—guinea, and the audience above a thousand.”

For this act of benevolence on the part of Handel, he was immediately enrolled as one of the Governors and Guardians of the Hospital.
108

During every year after this, until his infirmity obliged him to relinquish his profession, he superintended personally the performance of his matchless Oratorio of the Messiah, in the Chapel, which netted to the Treasury of the Charity no less a sum than £7,000,

The Governors of the Hospital seeing the profitableness of this performance, and being (as it appeared) misinformed of Handel's intention regarding the copyright, prepared a petition to Parliament to secure it for themselves The latter part of this petition is as follows :”That in order to raise a further sum for the benefit of the said Charity, George Frederick Handel, Esq.
hath been charitably pleased to give to this corporation a composition of musick, called 'The Oratorio of the Messiah,' composed by him the said George Frederick Handel, reserving to himself the liberty only of performing the same for his own benefit during his life ; and whereas the said benefaction cannot be gecured to the sole use of your petitioners, therefore humbly pray, that leave may be given to bring in a bill for the purposes aforesaid.”

Upon one of the Governors waiting upon the musielan with this form of petition, he soon discovered that the Committee of the Hospital had built upon a wrong foundation ; for Handel, bursting into a rage, exclaimed—” Te Deivel! for vat sal de Foundling put mein oratorio in de Parlement ? Te Deivel! mein music sal not go to de Parlement !”

Here the matter dropped, never to be revived. At the completion of the Chapel, Handel presented the 109

Governors with an organ, which he opened on the ist May, 1750, when the concourse of persons was so great that the performance was repeated fifteen days afterwards. Upon one of these occasion the audience was conveyed in no less than 800 coaches and chairs.

The Governors of the Hospital felt, naturally enough, a deep affection and veneration for Handel; and therefore, when, in April 1753, a foolish paragraph appeared in the daily papems, stating that hoe was preparing a funeral anthem, to be performed in the Chapel of the Hospital after his death, the Committee desired their Secretary to acquaint him, ”That the said paragraph has given this Committee great concern, they being highly sensible that all well—wishers to this charity must be desirous for the continuance of his life, who has been and is so great and generous a benefactor thereto.”

With the full concurrence of Handel, the Governers appointed his amanuensis and assistant, Mr. John Christopher Smith, the first organist of the Chapel.

At the death of the great musician, it was found he had made the following bequest : —” I give a fair copy of the score, and all the parts of my oratorio, called 'The Messiah,' to the Foundling Hospital.” The Governors resolved, in grateful memory of their friend and benefactor, to have a dirge and funeral anthem performed in the Chapel, on the 26th May, 1759, on the occasion of his demise, which performance took place under the direction of the organist of the Chapel, Mr. John Christopher Smith.

 110

Benjamin West, R.A.—On the finishing of the Chapel, Chevalier Casali presented the Governors with an altar—piece, the subject being ” The Offering of the Wise Men.” This picture occupied its appropriate place till 1801, when two of the Vice—Presidents, John 'Wilmot, Esq., and Thomas Everett, Esq., M.P., together with Sir Thomas Bernard, Bart., (the Treasurer,) and John Puget, Esq., agreed to purchase and present to the Hospital a picture by West, namely—Christ presenting a lttle Child.* This picture had been in the hands of a party, by whose mismanagement it had suffered some injury, and therefore West, in his determination to make it fully acceptable to the Governors, almost entirely repainted it. ” The care” (he says) ”with which I have passed that picture, I Alatter myself has now placed it in the first class of pictures from my penecil; at least, I have the satisfaction to find that to be the sentiment of the judges of painting who have seen it.”

For this act of generosity, the Governors resolved to elect West one of their corporate body.

He appears to have been highly fattered by this compliment, and in acknowledging it, states that his professional duties will not permit him to become an active member of the Corporation, but to show his respect and good wishes for the establishment in the



”And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,

” And said, Verily I say unto you, Except yo be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

” And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.” 111

only way he could make a return, he intended to add to the embellishment of the Chapel as follows :” There are” (he says) ” on each side the place of Communion in the Chapel, opposite the Governors' and Governors' Ladies' seats, two panels, well calculated to receive paintings. If the Governors will concur, at my leisure I propose to paint two pictures from sacred history to fill those panels, which I shall beg the Corporation to accept of‚, as a mark of my respect for the Institution, at the same time, to ask of .them the exclusive right of having prints taken from those pictures.”

It need not be added that the Governors immediately accepted this munificent and charitable offer, but it is to be lamented that the leisure of the artist never arrived, and that the work remains undone. If, perchance, any modern artist should read this, and have a laudable desire to establish his fame, he cannot do better than carry out the intention of West.

In 1816, the Chapel being then under repair, West had the Altar—Piece taken to his house and again re—touched it, returning it to its place with strong expressions towards this favourite work of his hand.

PROPOSAL FOR MAKING THE HOSPITAL AVAILABLE AS A PUBLIC MUSIC SCHOOL.

In July, 1774, Dr. Burney and Mr. Giardini, attended the Court of Governors, and proposed a plan for forming a Public Music School, by means of the children of the Hospital, which, having been taken into consideration, was unanimously accepted as ”likel: to be of considerable advantage to this Corporatiou> and of national utility.”

The Court immediately set about opening a subgeription roll (which received the support of the Dukes of Gloucester and Cumberland), and appointed a special Committee to ” digest and form the properest method for carrying the said plan into execution,” the Committee to consist of all the members of the Court 115

present, and the Duke of Portland, the Earl of Ashburnham, the Earl of Dartmouth, Lord Le Despencer, and Sir Watkin Williams Wynne, Bart.

But it was the fate of this scheme to be nipped in the bud. Its opponents proposed and carried a resolution at the next Court, which completely set it aside.
The resolution was this—”It appeared to this Court that the plan of a public music school, by way of employment of the children, is not warranted by the Act of Parliament.”

Madame d'Arblay,* in her Memoirs of Dr. Burney (her father), gives the following graphical account of this transaction :” But neither the pain of his illness, nor the pleasure of his recovery, nor even the loved labours of his history, offered sufficient occupation for the insatiate activity of his mind. No sooner did he breathe again the breath of health, resume his daily business, and return to his nocturnal studies, than a project occurred to him of a new undertaking, which would have seemed to demand the whole time and undivided attention of almost any other man.

” This was nothing less than to establish, in England, a seminary for the education of musical pupils of both sexes, upon a plan of which the idea should be borrowed, though the execution should almost wholly be new modelled, from the Conservatorios of Naples and Vienna.

”As disappointment blighted this scheme, just as



* The celebrated Miss Burney, author of ” Evelina,” &ec.
116

it scemed maturing to fruition, it would be to little purpose to enter minutely into its details ; and yet, as it is a striking feature of the fervour of Dr. Burney for the advancement of his art, it is not its failure through the secret workings of undermining prejudice, that ought to induce his biographer to omit recounting so interesting an intention and attempt ; and the less, as a plan, in many respects similar, has recently been put into execution, without any reference to the original projector.

”The motives that suggested this undertaking to Dr. Burney, with the reasons by which they were infAiuenced and supported, were to this effect :”In England, where more splendid rewards await the favourite votaries of musical excellence than in any other spot on the globe, there was no establishment of any sort for forming such artists as might satisfy the real connoisseur in music, and save English talent from the mortification, and the British purse from the depredations of seeking a constant annual supply of genius and merit from foreign shores. __

/ ” An institution, therefore, of this character, seemed < wanting to the state for national economy, and to the ”: _ people for national encouragement.

„ [”Such was the enlarged view which Dr. Burney, while yet in Italy, had taken of such a plan for his own country.

”The dificulty of collecting proper subjects to form its members, caused great diversity of opinion and of proposition amongst the advisers with whom Dr. Burney consulted.
117

” It was peculiarly necessary that these young disciples should be free from every gort of contamination, mental or corporal, upon entering this musical asylum that they might spread no dangerous contagion of either sort, but be brought up to the practice of the art, with all its delightful powers of pleasing, chastened from their abuse.

”With such a perspective, to take promiscuously the children of the poor, merely where they had an ear for music, or a voice for song, would be running the risk of gathering together a mixed little multitude, which, from intermingling inherent vulgarity, hereditary diseases, or vicious propensities, with the finer qualities requisite for admission, might render the cultivation of their youthful talents, a danger, if not a curse, to the country.

”Yet, the length of time that might be required for selecting little subjects of this unadulterated deseription from different quarters, with the next to impossibility of tracing, with any certainty, what might have been their real conduct in times past, or what might be their principles to give any basis of security for the time to come, caused a perplexity of the most serious species ; for should a single one of

the tribe go astray, the popular cry against teaching the arts to the poor would stamp the whole little community with a stain indelible, and the institution itself might be branded with infamy.

” What abstractedly was desirable, was, to try this experiment upon youthful beings to whom the world was utterly unknown, and who, not only in innocence P)

118

had breathed their infantine lives, but in complete and unsuspicious ignorance of evil.

”Requisites go hard to obtain, and a dilemma so intricate to unravel, led the Doctor to think of the Foundling Hospital, in the neighbourhood of which, in Queen Square, stood his present dwelling.

”He communicated, therefore his project to Sir Charles Whitworth, the Governor of the Hospital.
Sir Charles thought it proper, feasible, desirable, and patriotie.

”The Doctor, thus seconded, drew up a plan for forming a musical conservatorio in the metropolis of England, and in the bosom of the Foundling Hospital.

” The intention was to collect from the whole little

7> . _ corps all who had musical ears or tuneful voices, to be

brought up scientifically as instrumental or vocal per. formers. Those of the group who gave no decided ”\ promise of such qualifications, were to go on with their ——— ördinary education, and to abide by its ordinary result, according to the original regulations of the charity.

” A meeting of the Governors and Directors was convened by their chief, Sir Charles Whitworth, for announeing this scheme. The plan was heard with general approbation, but the discussions to which it gave rise were discursive and perplexing.

”It was objected, that music was an art of luxury, by no means requisite to life, or accessory to morality.
These children were all meant to be educated as plain but essential members of the general community.
They were to be trained up to useful purposes, with a singleness that would ward off all ambition for what 119

was higher, and teach them to repay the benefit of \ their support by cheerful labour. To stimulate them | | to superior views might mar the religious object of the | charity, which was to nu]hfy ratherthanextmguish all disposition to pride, vice, or voluptuousness, such as, probably, had demoralized their culpable parents, and thrown these deserted outcasts upon the mercy of the Foundling Hospital.

” This representation, the Doctor acknowledged, would be unanswerable, if it were decided to be right, and if it were judged to be possible, wholly to extirpate the art of music in the British empire, or, if the Foundling Hospital were to be considered as a seminary, predestined to menial servitude, and as the * only institution of the country where the members were to form a caste, from whose rules and plodden / ways no genius could ever emerge.

”But such a fiat could never be issued by John Bull, nor so flat a stamp be struck upon any portion of his countrymen. John Bull was at once too liberal and too proud to seek to adopt the tame ordinances of the immutable Hindoos, with whom ages past unmarked, generations unchanged, the poor never richer, the simple never wiser, and with whom, family by family, and trade by trade, begin, continue, and terminate their monotonous existence by the same predetermined course, and to the same invariable destiny.

” These children, the Doctor answered, are all orphans ; they are taken from no family, for by none are they owned ; they are drawn from no calling, for 120

to none are they specifically bred. They are all brought up to menial offices, though they are all instructed in reading and writing, and the females in needlework; but they are all systematically and indiscriminately destined to be servants or apprentices at the age of fifteen ; from which period, all their hold upon the benevolent institution to which they are indebted for their infantine rescue from perishing cold and starving want, with their subsequent maintenance and tuition, is rotarily transferred to new—born claimants ; for the Hospital then has fulfilled its engagements, and the children must go forth to the world, whether to their benefit or their disgrace.

” Were it not better, then, when there are subjects who are sucecess inviting, to bestow upon them professional improvement, with virtuous education since, as long as operas, concerts, and theatres are licensed by government, musical performers, vocal and instrumental, will inevitably be wanted, employed, and remunerated : and every state is surely best served, and the people of every country are surely the most encouraged, when the nation suffices for itself‚, and no foreign aid is necessarily called in, to share either the fame or emoluments of public performances ?

”Stop, then; prohibit, proseribe—if it be possibleall taste for foreign refinements, and for the exquisite finishing of foreign melody and harmony, or establish a school on our own soil, in which, as in painting and in sculpture, the foreign perfection of arts may be taught, transplanted, and culled, till they become indigenous.

Subjects who have been /. , brought up with the strietness of regular habits that | |. has warded them from all previous mischief, yet who |:\ are too helpless and ignorant, as well as poor, to be ‘\\\ able to develop whether or not nature, in her secret | workings, has kindled within their unconscious bosoms | a spark—a single spark of harmonic fire, that might light them from being hewers of wood and brushers of spiders, to those regions of vocal and instrumental excellence, that might propitiate the project of drawing from our own culture a school for music, of which the students, under proper moral and religious tutelage, might, in time, supersede the foreign auziliaries by whom they are now utterly extinguished.

”The objectors were charged, also, to weigh well that there was no law or regulation, and no means whatsoever that could prevent any of this little association from becoming singers and players, if they had musical powers, and such should be their wish ; though, if self—thrown into that walk, singers and players only at the lowest theatres, or at the tea and public gardens, or even in the streets, as fiddlers of country dances, or as ballad squallers, in which degraded exercise of their untaught endowments not only decent life must necessarily be abandoned, but immorality, licentiousness, and riot, must assimilate with, or rather form a prominent part of their exhibitions and performances.

” Here the discussion closed. The opponents were

C

2 122

silenced, if not convinced, and the trial of the project was decreed. The hardliy—fought battle over, victory, waving her gay banners, that wafted to the Doctor hopes of future renown with present benediction, determined him, for the moment, to relinquish even his history, that he might devote every voluntary thought to consolidating this schome.

” The primary object of his consideration, because the most conscientious, was the preservation of the morals and fair conduct of the pupils. And here, the exemplary character and the purity of the principles of Dr. Burney would have shone forth to national advantage, had the expected prosperity of his design brought his meditated regulations into practice.

” Vain would it be to attempt, and useless, if not vain, to deseribe his indignant consternation, when, while in the full occupation of these arrangements, a letter arrived to him from Sir Charles Whitworth, to make known, with great regret, that the undertaking was suddenly overthrown. The enemies to the attempt, who had seemed quashed, had merely lurked

. in ambush, to watch for an unsuspected moment to <. j/convene a partial Committee, in which they voted out

W // the scheme as an innovation upon the original purpose

% Z of the Institution ; and pleading, also, an old Act of

\'—J Parliament against its adoption, they solemnly proseribed it for over.*



* This apparent want of liberality on the part of the Governors in the mental culture of the children, reminds one of a darker period of the history 123

” Yet a repeal of that Act had been fully intended before the plan, which, hitherto had only been agitating and negotiating, should have been put into execution.

” All of choice, however, and all of respect that remained for Dr. Burney, consisted in a personal offer from Sir Charles Whitworth, to re—assemble an opposing meeting amongst those friends who, previously, had carried the day.

” But happy as the Doctor would have been to have gained, with the honour of general approbation, a point he had elaborately studied to clear from mystifying objections, and to render desirable even to patriotism, his pride was justly hurt by so abrupt a defalcation ; and he would neither with open hostility, nor under any versatile contest, become the founder or chief of so important an enterprise.

”He gave up, therefore, the attempt, without further struggle ; simply recommending to the mature reflections of the members of the last Committee, whether it were not more pious, as well as more rational to endeavour to ameliorate the character and lives of practical musical novitiates, than to behold the nation, in its highest classes, cherish the art, follow it, embellish it with riches, and make



of this small community. Dr. Johnson writes, in 1756 :—” When a few months ago, I wandered through the Hospital, I found not a child that seemed to have heard of his creed or the commandments. To breed up children in this manner, is to rescue them from an early grave, that they may find employment for the gibbet : from dying in innocence, that they may perish by their orimes.” 124

it fashion and pleasure; while, to train to that art, with whatever precautions, its appropriate votaries from the bosom of our own country, seemed to call for opposition, and to deserve condemnation.

”Thus died, in its birth, this interesting project, which, but for this brief sketch, might never have been known to have brightened the mind, as one of the projects, or to have mortified it, as one of the failures, of the active and useful life of Dr. Burney.”

THE BAND.

Happily, the prejudices so fatal to Dr. Burney's scheme, at the period alluded to, do not prevail with the Governors of the present day ; whose proceedings, with reference to the same subject, stand out in bold relief, when contrasted with that of their predecessors of 1774,—for when, in 1847, it was demonstrated to them, by the then Secretary, that the establishment of a Juventile Band of musicians, from amongst the boys, would be attended with advantages to them in

ife, they did not hesitate readily to adopt the suggestion. The proposal was immediately put into practice, and the results are highly satisfactory, proving (if indeed proof were necessary) that the ultivation of instrumental music amongst the children < of the Hospital is not attended with that degradation ”of moral character so much apprehended in Dr.
125

Burney's time. For not only has the general moral character of those instructed in music been improved, and their physical capacities enlarged, by the influence /_ of music during their stay in the Hospital; but so faras ' ..
has been manifested during the time in which music has been taught amongst them, considerable social V advantages have been derived by many of them from , this source when they have quitted the establishment, / —fully demonstrating the practicability of Dr. Burney's scheme, and that there is nothing to fear from the ” popular cultivation of music,” provided due regard u be had to the scieontific treatment of the art. It is now some years since the band was formed, numbering about thirty boys from nine to fourteen years. This number has, ever since, been maintained, sometimes exceeded. The boys are selected from amongst those who possess a musical ear, due regard being paid to their physical development. As the musical instruments, to which they are placed, are

essentially merx's instruments, considerable physical * ..

exertion is required in playing upon them. Great \ care is, therefore bestowed in watching the effects this early application produces upon the health of the children ; and no instance has ever occurred of injury being done by blowing. On the contrary, boys of delicate constitution have greatly improved in health from the exercise of a wind instrument.

As a considerable portion of the time allotted to the , practice of music is drawn from the ordinary school : hours, great care has, also, been taken to ascertain how far the band—boys are—when brought in competition

© f3 2o K £x 126

at the annual school examination with other boys not in the band—affected by this arrangement, and the results have shown that a full proportion of the prizes, awarded for scholastic pursuits has been constantly carried off by band—boys. This success at school may fairly be attributed to the salutary effects of music upon the character of those boys receiving instruction in the art, which imparts a vivacity to their tempers, and by its enlightening influence, renders the mental capacities more energetic and susceptible of receiving general instruction, than the faculties of the other boys attain, who do not enjoy the advantage of musical tuition.

During the period the band has been formed, a large number of the boys have received instruction, of whom, many, at their own desire, have been placed as musicians in the bands of Her Majesty's Household Troops, and other regiments, and also in the Royal NavyThus,whllesecunnganehglbleposmong} life for tWhas the formation of the band proved, by saving the expenses c of premium and outfit allowed for each boy « ordinarily apprenticed, ‘10me MtagetothzscorporatzonandngWLﬁMy” Norshouldltbelostmghtofthatverymanyofthe boys who have passed through the band, and are now occupied in various trades to which they have been apprenticed, have followed up their music as a recreation with satisfaction to themselves andtothose with whom it is their lot to be placed

”The great success which attended the establlshment of the juvenile band, and the want of proper accom127

modation for the practice of it, induced the Governorms to erect a ” Band Room,” and this has been followed by several gifts in connection with it, both useful and ornamental.

The late Lieut.—Colonel James C. Hyde presented a set of brass instruments for the use of the boys, and a sgeries of valuable and unique drawings, by Native Artists of India, for the adornment of the walls.

The late Baron Heath gave portraits of Carl Von Weber and Sir George Smart.

The late William Foster White, Esq. presented fourteen busts of Eminent Composers, on appropriate pedestals ; and the record of these liberal acts, in relation to the musical advancoment of the children, would be incomplete if the donation of J. P. Gassiot, Esq. of a grand pianoforte, for the use of the musical Instructors generally, was not here acknowledged.

THE MARCH TO FINCHLEY.
Br HOGARTH.

The following is considered the most authentic account of this celebrated picture, and is from the pen of Mr. Justice Welsh, the intimate friend and companion of Hogarth.

”The scene of this representation is laid at Tottenham Court Turnpike ; the King's Head, Adam and Eve, and the turnpike house, in full view ; beyond which are discovered, parties of the guards, baggage, &c., marching towards Highgate, and a beautiful distant prospect of the country; the sky finely painted. The picture, considered together, affords a view of a military march, and the humours and disorders consequent thereon. Near the centre of the picture, the painter has ezhibited his principal figure, which is a handsome young grenadier, in whose face is strongly depicted repentance mixed with pity and concern; the occasion of which is disclosed by two females putting in their claim for his person, one of whom has hold of his right arm, 133

and the other has seized his left. The figure upon his right hand, and perhaps placed there by the painter by way of preference, as the object of love is more desirable than that of duty, is a fine young girl in her person, debauched, with child, and reduced to the miserable employ of selling ballads, and who, with a look full of love, tenderness, and distress, casts up her eyes upon her undoer, and with tears descending down her cheeks, seems to say, 'sure you cannot—will not leave mel' The person and deportment of this figure well justifies the painter's turning the body of the youth towards her. The woman upon the left is a strong contrast to this girl; for rage and jealousy have thrown the human countenance into no amiable or desirable form. This is the wife of the youth, who, finding him engaged with such an ugly slut, assaults him with a violence natural to a woman whose person and beauty are neglected. Added to the fury of her countenance, and the dreadful weapon her tongue, another terror appears in her hand, equally formidable, which is a roll of papers, whereon is written 'The Remembrancer ;' a word of dire and triple import ; for while it shows the occupation the amiable bearer is engaged in, it reminds the youth of an unfortunate circumstance he would gladly forget; and the same word is also a caunt expression to signify the blow she is meditating.
And here, I value myself upon hitting the true meaning, and entering into the spirit of the great author of that celebrated Journal, called 'The Remembrancer.' 134

” It is easily discernible that the two .‚females are of different parties. The ballad of 'God save our noble King,' and a print of 'the Duke of Cumberland,' in the basket of the girl, and the cross upon the back of the wife, with the implements of her occupation, sufficiently denote the painter's intention ; and what is truly beautiful these incidents are applicable to the march. The hard—favoured sergeant directly behind, who enjoys the foregoing scene, is not only a good contrast to the youth, but also, with other helps, throws forward the principal figure. Upon the right of the grenadier is a drummer, who also has his two remembrancers, a woman and a boy, the produce of their kinder hours; and who have laid their claim by a violent seizure upon his person. The figure of the woman is that of a complainant, who reminds him of her great application, as well in sending him clean to guard, as other kind offices done, and his promises to make her an honest woman, which he, base and ungrateful, has forgot, and pays her affection with neglect. The craning of her neck shows her remonstrances to be of the shrill kind, in which she is aided by the howling of her boy. The drummer, who has a mixture of fun and wickedness in his face, having heard as many reproaches as suit his present inclination, with a bite of his lip and a leering eye, applies to the instrument of noise in his profession, and endeavours to drown the united clamour, in which he is luckily aided by the ear—piercing fife, near him.

”Between the figures before described, but more back in the picture, appears the important but meagre 135

phiz of a Frenchman, in close whisper with an Independent. The first, I suppose a spy upon the motion of the army; the other probably drawn into the crowd, in order to give intelligence to his brethren, at their next meeting, to commemorate their noble struggle in support of independence. The Frenchman exhibits a letter, which he assures him contains positive intelligence that ten thousand of his countrymen are landed in England in support of liberty and independence The joy with which his friend receives these glorious tidings, causes him to forget the wounds upon his head, which he has unluckily received by a too free and premature declaration of his principles. There is a fine contrast in a smile of innocence in the child at the woman's back, compared with the grim joy of a gentleman by it ; while the hard countenance of its mother gives a delicacy to the grenadier's girl. Directly behind the drummer's guondam spouse, a soldier is reclining against a shed, near which is posted a quack—bill of Dr. Rock; and directly over him a wench at a wicket is archly taking a view, both of the soldier and of the march. Behind the drummer, under the sign of the Adam and Eve, are a group of figures, two of which are engaged in the fashionable art of bruising ; their equal dexterity is shown by sewed—up peepers on one side, aund a pate well sconced on the other. And here the painter has shown his impartiality to the merit of our youtks, (who, their minds inflamed with a love of glory, appear, not only encouragers of tbis truly laudable seience, but many 136

of them are also great proficients in the art itself,) by introducing a youth of quality, whose face is expressive of those boisterous passions necessary to form a hero of this kind; and who, entering deep into the scene, endeavours to inspire the combatants with a noble contempt of bruises and broken bones.
. An old woman, moved by a foolish compassion, endeavours to force through the crowd, and part the fray, in which design she is stopped by a fellow who prefers fun and mischief to humanity. Above their heads appears Jackey James, a cobbler, a little man of meagre frame, but full of spirits, who enjoys the combat, and with fists clenched, in imagination deals blow for blow with the heroes. ”This figure is finely contrasted by a heavy, sluggish fellow just behind. The painter, with a stroke of humour peculiar to himself, has exhibited a figure shrinking under the load of a heavy box upon his back, who preferring curiosity to ease, is a spectator, and waits, in this uneasy state, the issue of the combat. Upon a board next the sign, where roots, flowers, &ec.
were said to be sold, the painter has humourously altered the words Tottenham Court Nursery, alluding to a bruising booth'.then in that place, and the group of figures underneath. ”Passing through the turnpike, appears a carriage laden with the implements of war, as drums, halberds, tent—poles and hoop—petticoats. Upon the carriage are two old women—campaigners, funking their pipes, and holding a conversation, as usual, in fire and smoke.
The grotesque figures afford a fine contrast to a 137

delicate woman upon the same carriage, who is suckling a cbild. This excellent figure evidently proves, that the painter is as capable of succeeding in the graceful style as in the humourous. A little boy lies at tho feet of this figure ; and the painter, to show him of martial breed, has placed a small trumpet in his mouth.

”The serious group of the principal figures in the centre is finely relieved by a scene of humour on the left. Here an officer has seized a milk wench, and is rudely kissing her. While the officer's ruffles guffer in this action, the girl pays her price, by an arch soldier, who, in her absence of attention to her pails, is filling his hat with milk, and, by his waggish eye, seoms also to partake in the kissing sceng. A chimney—sweeper's boy, with glee, puts in a request to the soldier, to supply him with a cap full when his own turn is served ; while another goldier points out the fun to a fellow selling pies, who, with an inimitable face of simple joy, neglects the care of his goods, which the soldier dexterously removes with his other hand. In the figure of the pieman the pencil has exceeded all power of description. The old soldier, divested of one spatterdash, and near losing the other, is knocked down by allpotent gin : upon calling for tother cogue, his waggish

„comrade, supporting him with one hand, erdeavours to pour water into his mouth with the other, which the experienced old one rejects with disdain, puts up his hand to his wife, who bears the arms and gin—bottle, and who, well acquainted with his taste, 140

honour of dedicating to his Majesty the print engraved from it ; and a proof—print was accordingly presented for his approbation. The king probably expected to sgee an allegorical representation of an army of heroes, devoting their lives to the service of their country and their sovereign ; we may, therefore. readily conceive his disappointment on viewing their delineation. 'Does the fellow mean to laugh at my guards ?' exclaimed the indignant monarch to a nobleman in waiting. 'The picture, please your Majesty, must be considered as a burlesque.' 'What! a painter burlesque a soldier? he deserves to be picketed for his insolence.' = The print was returned to the artist, who, completely mortified at such a reception of what he properly considered to be his greatest work, immediately altered the inseription, inserting, instead of the .+ EKing of England, ”the King of Prusia (so spelt in the earliest impressions ) an encourager of the Arts.”

THR CARTOON OF THE MURDER OF THE INNOCENTS.
Br RAFFAEL.

This cartoon came into the possession of the Hospital under the will of Prince Hoare, Esq.

The late lamented painter, B. R. Haydon, in a letter to the Secretary of the Hospital, dated 3rd October, 1837, has given the following graphical account of this picture :” Dear Sir,

”I was extremely gratified yesterday at having ocular demonstration by your kindness, that one of the finest instances in the world of variety of expression and beauty of composition, as a work of 'high art,' was out of danger and secure: I allude to the centre part of one of the last cartoons which belonged to the set executed by Raffael, at the order of Leo X., and szent afterwards to Flanders, to be executed in tapestry, for the purpose of increasing the splendour of those exhibitions, so well known in Rome during Lent, at the Vatican.

” The original number was thirteen ; but in consequence of the Flemish weavers cutting them into slips for their working machinery, after the tapestry was

executed and sent to Rome, the original cartoons were L 146

left mingled together, without care or interest, in bozxes.

” When Rubens was in England, he told Charles I.
the condition they were in ; and the king, who had the finest taste, desired him to procure them. Seven perfect ones were purchased, all, it may be inferred, which remained, and sent to his Majesty : what became, or had become of the remainder, nobody knows; but here and there, all over Europe, fragments have appeared. At Oxford there are two or three heads ; and, I believe, the Duke of Hamilton or Buecleuch has others. — But this sublime fragment, possessed by the Governors, is certainly the largest portion of those which are last remaining. I am quite sure, on this explanation, the Governors will perceive, on every point of view, the value, both as property and as a work of art, of this invaluable composition. After the king's misfortunes, the cartoons now at Hampton Court were sold, with the rest of his Majesty's fine collection; but by Cromwell's express order, they were bought in for three hundred pounds.

” During the reign of Charles II., they were offered to France for fourteen thousand francs, but Charles was dissuaded from selling them. I cannot give you my authority at the moment.

” This portion of the Murder of the Innocents was sold at Westminster as disputed property. Prince Hoare's father, before the sale, explained to an opulent friend the great treasure about to be disposed of, and persuaded him to advance the money requisite, on condition of sharing the property. To his great wonder, he bought it for twenty—six pounds, and his 147

friend, having no taste, told Mr. Hoare, if he would paint him and his family, he would relinquish his right.

”I had these particulars from Prince Hoare, (his son), who repeatedly told me. I took Canova to see it (1815), who was enthusiastic in admiration ; and I was allowed, in my early studies (1804), thirtythree years ago, to copy all the heads, and I am quite gure there is hardly a day passes in which I do not feel the great advantage of so sublime a model for expression and composition. Look at the villain in front, grappling the leg of a victim child, and rolling on like a mountain fragment, which nothing can arrest! while the fiery and passionate mother throttles the monster to save her child, though you can perceive the mere physical weight of the iron—faced murderer will render her feminine resistance useless and in vain !

” As an instance of preserving beauty in violent expression, this head is unequalled in any of the great works of art in the world. It is a model of study, and I remember nothing to be compared to it.

”Above this group is a woman of phlegmatic nature, as a contrast to the violent temperament of the one below; she is pale, blank, and utterly unnerved; sho stares at the murderer, who is pressing down the innocent face of her infant, and dashing the dagger into its throat, quite paralyzed and unable to resist. Above her is a young mother, with long hair, tenderly protecting her child, while the group is finished by a scoundrel, who, holding the hair of 148

one that is trying to escape, stabs the infant of the opposite woman, who has her hand in his eyes.

” For all the intricate beauties of composition, for various modifications of the same feeling, according to the character chosen, there is no finer example any where, and such a work ought not to be in a back room badly lighted and scarcely seen, but in a room by itself, well lighted, the walls coloured on purpose, and in fact, such a production for the sake of the art, should be shown off to every advantage. It would be justice to Raffael, an honour to the Hospital and its Governors, and a kind compliment to my late friend : it would do the English school great good, and advance the taste of all classes.

” One day in the week an advanced student, under proper introduction, might be admitted to finish his studies from it, and it might always be regularly shewn and explained to the visitors.

”Pray, my dear Sir, lay my letter before the Governors, if you think it would not be a liberty, at their next meeting, and be assured I have no other object but the good of the art, the tenderest respect for my late friend, and an earnest desire to see so valuable a prize preserved as long as the materials will hold together.

”I am, dear Sir, « With every apology, ” Truly yours,

”B. R. Haxyoon.” 149

BUST OF HANDEL.
Br LOUIS FRANCIS ROUBILIAC.

The above bust was taken by the artist from sittings to him by Handel, and is the original work from which the celebrated statue in Vauxhall Gardens and that in Westminster Abbey were made.
At the sale of Mr. Barrett, the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens, the bust was purchased by Mr. Bartieman, and was, for many years, esteemed by him as his greatest treasure. Upon his death, it passed, by sale, into the hands of the trade ; and lastly, upon the recommendation of Mr. William Behnes, seulptor, was purchased and presented to the Hospital by Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, a Vice—President of the Hospital.



THE CHILD RESTORED TO ITS MOTHER.
Br EMMA BROWNLOW.

This picture was presented to the Hospital by E. W. Wadeson, Esq., one of the Vice—Presidents.

The following interesting account of it is copied from Tait's Edinburgh Magazine of November, 1858 :”Standing on an easel, in one corner of the relic room, is a picture* beautifully imagined and executed.
It represents a little simple—looking child, neatly clad in the foundling dress. The little brown frock, the tidy white apron, and the high—crowned muslin cap—looking so quaint and so demure on the little creature—are faithfully depicted. A girl of about

fourteen years of age leads the child with one hand, while with the other she points to a young and respectably—dressed woman who invites the hesitating child to come to her. There are tears in the eyes of this young woman, and a loving look of tenderness dwells in those tearful eyes as she looks at the little child, which betrays the relationship between them. A child's hat wbhich she has brought with her, and which lies on a chair near, together with an open band—box containing childish apparel, tells the tale of a mother's thought, care, and love. An elderly female is in the back—ground ; we may suppose her another relative of the little foundling, or a friend of the poor, sorrowful mother.

”This picture was painted some months since, and the little girl who was taken as the model of the reclaimed child, was the one restored about a fortnight ago. At the time the picture was painted no idea was entertained that this child would be reclaimed.

”But a ‚few more words about this picture. As we have before stated, it is beautifully painted, and there is a depth of truthful and poetic feeling in it, which does as much credit to the heart and mind of the artist as the mere manipulation conveys to her artistie skill. It contains a portrait of Mr.
Brownlow (the Secretary), who is introduced in the back—ground. We recognized this portrait at once, and were surprised to hear that the picture we so much admired was the work and production of his daughter.” 152

POSTSCRIPT.

There has been much talk of late about the necessity of establishing in this country Foundling Hospitals, in their extensive signification—that is —Asylums where everybody's children may be received and maintained at the Public Expense—and this proposal is deliberately made, notwithstanding the total failure of such a scheme formerly, as is detailed in this book. To carry such a proposition into effect in these days, would be falsifying the adage which couples experience with wisdom, and putting out the beacon-light which our forefathers häve left us as a wammg on this subject. We are told that this step is necessary to prevent Infanticide.
This is about as foolish a notion as that of the

mers of the present poor law, who proposed to prevent bastardy, by enacting alawthedirect tendencyofwhichwastomcreaselt!Thereare evﬂsmthwhichsocletyisaﬂllcted beyond the\ reach of human remedy, and to talk of preventing \ infantlclde is simply to utter that which is opposed fo common sense and experience. }

That sensible old philanthropist, Jonas Hanway,* who was a zealous Governor of, the Foundling Hospital in 1756, and subsequently an actor in the scenes of its early administration, writes, in



* This exoellent man was constantly engaged in works of benevolence, having for their object the amelioration of the condition of poor children. In furtherance of this, he founded the Marine Society, and worked strenuously to improve the state of the Chimney Sweeping Boys, whose treatment at that time was of the most brutal kind. At the Foundling he was no less zealous in advancing the interests of the children. With what loving—kindness he writes, in 1759 : ” As I lamented my own loss so very early in life, I foel the more for the children who are already cut off from all connections with parents; I cannot help wishing it were possible for me to become a father to all of them, by every act of paternal care.”” He prepared for them a paper of farewell advice on quitting the Hospital, which is in use to this day, and a ” Hymn of Praise,” which, as it has never been published, I here insert :To Thee, Great Author of my life, v My humble vows I raise!

0, deign from Thy celestial throne, To hear my artless praise !

Each op'ning day, each closing night, To Thy blest realms above,

My pious hymn shall duly rise Of pure and filial love.

Without Thy aid my vital frame In cheerless want had pined !
Nor had one ray of saving truth Shone on my darken'd mind.

In all my labours, all my works, May I Thy mercy share;

That mercy softens every toil, And sweetens every care.

Still may increasing heavenly gifts My rising years attend ;

That I may ever find in Thee A Father and a Friend!
157

1759, on reviewing the follies which had been committed, thus :”To make a law, or provide an Hospital, which supposes, that without it, women will murder their children, however we may be induced to argue from some few known facts, supposes too much, and familiarizes our thoughts to a crime the most abhorrent to nature. Nor can any law, or any Hospital, restrain those, whose cruelty or shame carries them such desperate lengths. We find some women have been executed for the murder of their infants, and some infants have been found murdered, notwithstanding the indulgence shewn by the Hospital.”

Again he says :”I believe, to one infant secretly strangled, or put to death, by the hands of the mother, five thousand die in the face of the sun by the ignorance or neglect

of the mother or nurse, and five thousand more by being taken from the breast of the mother.”

But we are told that as Hospitals for the ind:iseriminate admission of Children flourish in foreign countries, they ought to exist here. I1 have already shewn that this was the rock on which the early Governors and Parliament split at the outset of the London Foundling Hospital, and this is confirmed by the same excellent authority already quoted.

” It_seems,” says JonasHanway‚“tohavebeena general mistake in establishing the Hospital, that we founded our arguments for it, and the great prmclple 158

of the plan, upon the practice of other nations, drawing our conclusions with too little attention to the genius of our own.”

Now with respect to Foreign Foundling Hospitals, it is a curious fact, that whilst parties in this country are holding them up to our example and imitation because of their liberal or unrestricted operation, the authorities of those institutions are themselves eircumseribing their views on this subject, and bringing these establishments down to the sober and consistent level of the London Foundling Hospital.

In France, the work of reformation has been going on for a considerable time. The following are extracts from notes, on the present system taken in 1864 :”Few persons know that the Hospital for Foundlings no longer exists. That which hitherto was

called by that sad name, has given place to the Enfans Assistés.”

”The wheel (or turning bozx) as an active medium

<for abandoning children has disappeared, and the

statistics shew that neither miscarriages nor infantieides have increased in consequence.” < ” The person who brings a child is admitted into the office, and expected to reply to certain questions relative to the name and place of its birth, and of its parents who abandon it. The child is always received under a provisional order, and immediately conducted 159

to the nursery or the hall, according to its age. The director sends, as sgoon as possible, all the references obtained to the central administration for public assistance, who pronounces on the definite admission, and makes known the decision with the least possible delay : during the interval, the police have time to enquire into the cause of desertion, when it seems made under unusual ceircumstances. They thus assure themselves that the child, from its origin, does not belong to any other institution.”

”In general, the information given at the Bureau is true; the children are for the most part illegitimate, and misery, more than misconduct, causes the desertion. The investigation is not very strict, the certificate of birth wbich must mention the name of the mother does not oblige her to acknowledge the child hereafter. It is necessary that a special document, signed by her own hand, should confirm or rectify the certificate of birth.”

” It is sufficient to pass some hours at the entrance of the house in the Rue d'Enfers, in the vestibule of the office of reception, to convince oneself that the mothers who bring their children, no longer have a bold and immodest air, which is the last outrage to neglected duty. Nor do they evince much grief: they have more the appearance of .
resignation to a temporary separation, and confidence in social benevolence with a fixed hope of reclaiming them in future.”

”The true character of this act is a deposit, not 160

an abandonment, and it is with justice the authorities

have substituted 'on the frontispiece of the house, / for the ancient title of 'Enfans Trouvés' that of £ 'Enfans Assistés.'”

The wheel system in Portugal has also been abandoned.

And yet, is there nothing to do on this subject of infanticrde ? Yes, there is. Let us look manfully in the face of the companion evil—the evil of bastardy—and coping with this (if we can) a diminution of infanticide may possibly follow in proportion to our success. Let parliament infuse into the existing law, a little more justice and charity towards the weaker, and direct their shafts with greater certainty at the stronger of the two offending parties, and although this will not even then prevent either of these evils, they will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that they have done all they can towards lessening them !
