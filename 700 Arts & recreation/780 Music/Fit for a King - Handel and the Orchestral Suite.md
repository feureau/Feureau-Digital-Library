# Fit for a King: Handel and the Orchestral Suite

The term “suite” describes an instrumental work in several movements linked by common themes or characteristics. During the Baroque, when solo and orchestral suites were one of the most popular genres throughout Europe and England, most or all of the movements were based on dance styles and were generally all in the same key. The Baroque orchestral suite reached a pinnacle in the music of Bach and Handel (left).

After falling out of fashion during the Classical era, the orchestral suite underwent a major revival in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. In one type, movements were based on national folk dances from the composer’s homeland or themes not linked to dance at all, as in Holst’s The Planets. Other orchestral suites, such as Copland’s Appalachian Spring, were arrangements of selections from a ballet, opera, or other stage work.

In terms of his output, George Frideric Handel (1685–1759) was much more interested in dramatic vocal music than in purely instrumental genres, but two of his most famous works are orchestral suites: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks. Written 32 years apart, in 1717 and 1749, respectively, both splendidly evoke the celebratory outdoor occasions for which they were composed.

## Introducing the Suite

Handel's Water Music, despite its popularity and reputation, has a significant mystery attached to it: while there were individual instrumental parts that were recovered from the first performance, there is no surviving full score in the composer's hand. As a result, the order in which the players originally performed the movements, which were composed in three different keys, is not precisely known. Many different versions of the entire work were published in the three centuries since its first performance, but today it is often grouped into three separate suites that each share common key signatures and distinctive instrumentations.

The Suite No. 1 in F Major contains a mixture of 10 dance and non-dance movements, with the last one sometimes omitted to achieve a more decisive and rousing conclusion. It is scored for oboes, horns, and strings. However, two instruments that are not specifically called for in the score but are used in many performances, including the one you heard in the video for this module, are the harpsichord and the theorbo. The reason for this is that during the Baroque, the bass line was played by a variety of instruments, including the keyboard as well as plucked and/or bowed string instruments. For any given concert, the decision about which instruments to use was based on a variety of factors, ranging from the repertoire being performed to the availability of musicians.

Like many other Baroque orchestral suites, Water Music Suite No. 1 in F Major begins with a French overture. French overtures are divided into two main sections, one or both of which may be repeated. The first part is slow and majestic, with a characteristic recurring pattern of a long note followed by a short note or series of notes. The second part is fast and contrapuntal, meaning that more than one melody is going on at the same time. Contrapuntal passages were a predominant feature of music composed during the Baroque era. Another typical feature of Baroque music that this section displays is the discursive relationship between solo instruments and the full orchestra.

## The Art of Improvisation

The second movement (“Adagio et staccato”) provides a chance for the oboe soloist to demonstrate the art of improvisation, another important aspect of Baroque performance practice. For this movement, Handel wrote a very simple melody, one that intentionally provides a soloist with ample space and a framework in which to add ornamentation. The example below shows an excerpt of the oboe part that Handel wrote for this movement on the bottom staff. The top staff is a transcription of what Jonathan Kelly, principal oboe with the Berliner Philharmoniker, played in the full performance you heard excerpted in the video for this module. As you can see, he played many more notes than just those included in the score.

## Enter the Horns

The third movement is particularly dramatic, as it signals the first entrance of "hunting" horns in the piece. Even more extraordinary, according to Baroque music specialist Anthony Hicks, is that the piece marks the horn’s first appearance in any orchestral work in England. You’ll recall that the first performance of the work took place outdoors on the Thames River. As the horn was originally intended for outdoor use, the instrument was perfectly suited to the occasion. Handel’s idiomatic writing showcases the horn's abilities to the fullest. As the horns are also featured prominently in several subsequent movements, this particular suite is indeed often referred to as the “Horn” Suite.

While the horns take a well-deserved rest in the fourth movement (“Andante”), the bassoon has a more audible role as the main melodic material alternates between the woodwinds and strings. Instead of providing a sense of harmonic closure at the end of the movement, Handel postpones it to coincide with the beginning of the fifth movement.

## Minuets and More

The fifth movement is in the style of a minuet, a popular French aristocratic social dance in triple meter (i.e. the basic unit of the pulse is grouped into three). French suites share the traditional specific dance forms of allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue. Furthermore, some composers began to add other optional dance forms to the suite, known as galanteries. The minuet was one of the later optional dance movements.

The more lyrical sixth movement is followed by a lengthier minuet in the seventh. Opening with a striking duet for the horns, unlike the fifth movement, this minuet includes a contrasting section in the key of F minor that provides a chance for the horns to rest before they repeat the opening material.

The eighth movement is a bourrée, a French folk and court dance, also considered part of the galanteries. In contrast to the minuet, the bourrée is in duple meter (i.e. the basic unit of the pulse is grouped into two) and has a unique characteristic phrase structure.

Handel follows the bourrée in this suite with a hornpipe, a jolly type of dance in duple meter originating from the British Isles. Some sources indicate that each of these two short movements was to be repeated three times, with different instruments playing each time. While the original score has ten movements with the last one functioning as a transition to the next suite, some conductors close the suite with a repeat of the bourrée. This performance decision provides a convincing solution to the question of how to conclude this unusually open-ended work.
