# An Unconventional Classic: Mozart and the Solo Concerto

The term "concerto" first appeared in the late 1500s, but it wasn't until the eighteenth century was well under way that it acquired its present meaning as a work featuring one or more instrumental soloists with orchestra. Two distinct types of concerto emerged during this period: the concerto grosso, which featured a small group of soloists and orchestra, and concertos for a single soloist and orchestra. During the Classical era, the concerto grosso fell out of fashion, while the solo concerto became a popular genre, which it remains.

From the Baroque period through the early part of the twentieth century, solo concertos were typically organized in three movements with the following tempo indications: fast – slow – fast. While the violin was the most commonly featured solo instrument during the concerto's early history, gradually concertos were written for other instruments. One of the most influential composers of concerti during the Baroque was Antonio Vivaldi, who wrote more than 600 of them! Another was Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the first composers to write concertos for the keyboard.

With the rise of the virtuoso composer-performer during the Romantic era, the concerto provided an opportunity in which the technical capabilities of the soloist could be pushed and redefined. In the twentieth century, we find concertos written for less common solo instruments (trombone, saxophone) as well as for multiple soloists, hearkening back to the concerto grosso.

Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91) wrote and mastered nearly every genre and style prevalent at the time. From a very early age, he traveled across Europe with his family as a child prodigy, known foremost as a pianist. Writing works at an exceptional pace, it wasn't long before his versatile compositional skills were also recognized. By writing piano concertos, Mozart had the opportunity to combine both talents. His piano concertos feature a particularly complex relationship between soloist and orchestra, as we'll see in the following section.

## First Movement Form

This early concerto represents Mozart's first real masterpiece. Legendary pianist Alfred Brendel called it "one of the wonders of the world," and chose it as the last piece he ever performed in public before his retirement. The concerto is scored for two oboes, two horns, strings, and solo piano, a small but versatile ensemble typical of the time it was composed.

One of the most striking aspects of this work is the ingenious ways it departs from previously established conventions of the concerto. During Mozart's time, listeners would have expected the first movement of most orchestral works, for example, to follow a structure known as sonata form. Sonata form contains three main parts: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation. The exposition generally contains two large sections, a primary theme and a contrasting secondary theme in a new key. The development section explores and develops musical ideas from the exposition. The recapitulation (or “recap”) is a repeat of the exposition, with both themes in the same key. The recap may be followed by a coda.

## Eager Entrances

The first movement of a concerto would begin with a statement of the exposition by the orchestra alone. After the orchestral exposition, the soloist would enter, repeating essentially the same music from the exposition with the orchestra accompanying in the background. But in this case, the piano interrupts the orchestra not just once but two times right at the very outset of the movement, before the orchestra is able to proceed. Flying in the face of standard concerto procedure, such an intrusion must have made quite an impression on its first audiences!

## More Surprises

The next big surprise comes towards the end of the orchestral exposition. Normally, the soloist would not play a note until this section ended. In this concerto though, the piano sneaks in early, several measures before the orchestra finishes.

Another conventional feature in the first movement of most concertos is the presence of a cadenza — a rhythmically free, virtuosic solo passage — towards the end of the movement. By tradition, it is the last thing the soloist plays before the next movement. But in this concerto, Mozart reveals another clever trick up his sleeve when the pianist enters once again with the trill and a few more measures of material, putting in one final word even after a showy cadenza.

## Key Emotions

The mood of the concerto turns from playful to despairing in the second movement, where Mozart continues his experimentation by setting it in C minor. Since minor keys are often historically associated with sadness or anger, Mozart's choice of a minor key for the movement should not seem surprising. Yet this was the first time he ever used a minor key for the slow movement of a concerto. The key of C minor in particular seems to have held special meaning for Mozart; he composed just one piano sonata and one piano concerto in this key.

The second movement is also well known for the exceptional eloquence of its melodies, which anticipate Mozart's inspired writing for the voice in his operas to come. This quality is immediately apparent in the opening of the movement, where the strings establish the mood and then repeat the same music as the piano adds a new melody on top.

## An Unusual Episode

The third movement returns to the same key of E-flat major as the first movement, with a presto (very fast) tempo indication. It is a virtuosic, perpetual-motion type of movement with few opportunities for the soloist to rest. Like many final movements in Classical concertos and symphonies, it is a rondo. Rondos are characterized by the alternation between a main theme (or refrain) and other themes, called episodes.In this movement the main theme begins with an unusually long passage for the piano before the orchestra enters.

## A Pleasant Surprise

In another highly inventive departure from convention, Mozart inserts a minuet, with a completely new tempo and key, into his rondo. The minuet was danced as far back as the time of the court of Louis XIV during the Baroque. Thanks to its characteristic grace and charm, it was the only type of Baroque dance that remained a staple in the later eighteenth century, when good taste and refinement were highly valued. Since the concerto was written for Victoire Jenamy, this highly unusual episode may have been a clever tribute to her father, Jean-Georges Noverre, a famous dancer, choreographer, and friend of Mozart's.

Stylistically, the concerto epitomizes the standards of good taste, balance, and euphony that were hallmarks of the Classical era. Yet at the same time Mozart, who is known to have had a keen (if sometimes coarse) sense of humor, was able to incorporate these mischievous individualisms that give the work a whole new dimension.
